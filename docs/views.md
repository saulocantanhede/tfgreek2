# Views <a name="start"></a>

## The view types

This database offers the users two distinct views to represent the syntax trees:
   * [Syntactic view](syntactic-view.md#start) (default): presents the syntax tree using linguistic terms like phrases and clauses.
   * [WordGroup view](wg-view.md#start): presents the syntax tree in a more agnostic manner by means of word groups.

## User impact

It was found that both data designs with their repective views might have their uses, hence this Text-Fabric dataset providing both. As a result, syntactic queries can be constructed to match either one of these data structures. The following figure provides two functionaly equivalent queries:
