# Views <a name="start"></a>

This database offers the users two distinct views to represent the syntax trees:
   * [Syntactic view](syntactic-view.md#start) (default): presents the syntax tree using linguistic terms like phrases and clauses.
   * [WordGroup view](wg-view.md#start): presents the syntax tree in a more agnostic manner by means of word groups.
