# Nestle 1904 GNT - Features 

In Text-Fabric, a "feature" refers to attributes associated with nodes, which represent linguistic elements in the text, including words, word groups, sentences, and verses. These features contain additional information specific to these nodes, facilitating diverse linguistic analyses and data extraction.
Text-Fabric, true to its name, implements the concepts of 'warp' and 'weft', inspired by textile weaving, to represent its data. The 'warp' denotes the foundational structured data, encompassing linguistic annotations like words, and phrases, while the 'weft' refers to the additional layers of information, known as features. These features encompass linguistic data, annotations, and metadata, seamlessly woven into the 'warp' data, resulting in a clear separation between structure and content. This approach enables Text-Fabric to efficiently handle complex linguistic datasets with versatility.

Feature descriptions listed by different groupings:
* [Grouped by feature group](features/featuresbygroup.md#start): e.g., [`Orthographic`](features/featuresbygroup.md#orthograpic-features), [`Syntactic`](features/featuresbygroup.md#syntactic-features).
* [Grouped by node type](features/featuresbynodetype.md#start): e.g., [`word`](features/featuresbynodetype.md#word-nodes), [`clause`](features/featuresbynodetype.md#clause-nodes).
* [Grouped by data type](features/featuresbydatatype.md#start): e.g., [`str`](features/featuresbydatatype.md#string-datatype), [`int`](features/featuresbydatatype.md#integer-datatype).
* [Grouped by feature type](features/featuresbyfeaturetype.md#start): e.g., [`node`](features/featuresbyfeaturetype.md#node-features), [`edge`](features/featuresbyfeaturetype.md#edge-features).
