## Feature value

## Notes

See also the related feature [parent](parent.md#start).

Add a usage example.

Due to the large size of the .tf file, it is stored in a compressed format (zip file) in the usual location on GitHub, specifically in the tf/{version} directory. However, this feature file is also included in the 'complete.zip' file, which is part of the release. Depending on how Text-Fabric is invoked, either the 'complete.zip' file is downloaded or each individual .tf file is obtained separately. If the file has not been downloaded, it can be manually downloaded as a zip file.
