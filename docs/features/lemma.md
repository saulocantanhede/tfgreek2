## Feature description

Lexical lemma according to Bible Dictionary of Ancient Greek (BDAG) and/or ANLEX by Friberg, Friberg, and Miller.

## Notes

When using the [Bible Online Learner](http://www.dadel.org/) as an aid in exploring text and creating Text-Fabric queries, it is advisable to use the [bol_lemma](bol_lemma.md#start) feature instead of this one to circumvent potential issues arising from a slightly different handling of Unicode codepoints.

## Source description

Taken from XML attribute `lemma` of tag `w` (word).
