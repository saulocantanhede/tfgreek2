# Example use-cases of this Text-Fabric dataset

The following are several use-case examples that demonstrate the utilization of the Text-Fabric dataset. While Text-Fabric,  which is implemented as a Python package, can be employed in any stand-alone Python script, it is commonly utilized from within a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) â€” an interactive web-based computational environment enabling users to create and share documents with live code, visualizations, and text, thus facilitating the inclusion of explanatory notes alongside queries and results obtained from Text-Fabric.
