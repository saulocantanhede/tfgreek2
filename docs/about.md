# Nestle 1904 GNT - About

This is the [text-fabric](https://annotation.github.io/text-fabric/tf/) version of the Nestle 1904 Greek New Testament, containing the Greek text augmented with linguistic annotations.

## About Text-Fabric

Text-Fabric is a powerful Python library and framework designed to facilitate the analysis and manipulation of large-scale textual data, particularly in the context of ancient languages and biblical texts. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for processing and querying structured text data efficiently. Text-Fabric was developed by [Dirk Roorda](https://github.com/dirkroorda). The software package is accessible at [https://github.com/annotation/text-fabric](https://github.com/annotation/text-fabric).

Detailed information regarding Text-Fabric can be found at:

* [Text-Fabric Handbook](https://annotation.github.io/text-fabric-book)

## Provenance

On this repository: This dataset contains several versions in the directory [tf](../tf).

Greek New Testament, edited by Eberhard Nestle, published in 1904 by the British and Foreign Bible Society. See [here](https://archive.org/details/the-greek-new-testament-nestle-1904-us-edition/mode/2up) a scan of the orginal publication: Nestle, Eberhard. *Η Καινή Διαθήκη Novum Testamentum Graece* (New York: Fleming H. Revell Company, 1904).  The 1913 reprint is available [here](https://archive.org/details/hkainediathekete00lond/). Transcription by [Diego Santos](https://sites.google.com/site/nestle1904/home), morphology by Ulrik Sandborg-Petersen, markup by Jonathan Robie. 

It is worth noting that the current standard version used in academic settings is the [Nestle-Aland edition 28](https://www.academic-bible.com/en/online-bibles/novum-testamentum-graece-na-28/read-the-bible-text/). Despite this, the Nestle 1904 provided by this Text-Fabric implementation, is the closest version in terms of the ‘principal text’ available in the public domain which is suitable to perform syntactical analysis.

## Sourcedata

The Text-Fabric files were created based upon the LowFat trees XML files. The source data for the conversion are the XML node files representing the macula-greek version of the Nestle Aland 1904 Greek New Testment.
