fourteen
and
from

until

carrying away

generations
fourteen
and
from
the

until
the

generations
fourteen
-
Now
of Jesus
Christ
the
birth
thus
came about
Having been pledged
the
mother
of Him
Mary
-
to Joseph
before
rather
coming together
of them
she was found
in
womb
having [a child]
out of
[the] Spirit
Holy
Joseph
now
the
husband
of her
righteous
being
and
not
willing
her
to expose publicly
purposed
secretly
to send away
her
These things
now
of him
having pondered
behold
an angel
of [the] Lord
in
a dream
appeared
to him
saying
Joseph
son
of David
not
you should fear
to receive
Mary
[as] the
wife
of you
that
for
in
her
having been conceived
from
[the] Spirit
is
Holy
She will bear
then
a son
and
you will call
the
name
of Him
Jesus
He
for
will save
the
people
of Him
from
the
sins
of them
This
then
all
has come to pass
that
may be fulfilled
that
having been spoken
by
the Lord
through
the
prophet
saying
Behold
the
virgin
in
womb
will hold
and
will bear
a son
and
they will call
the
name
of Him
Immanuel
which
is
being translated
With
us
-
God
Having been awoken
then
-
Joseph
from
the
sleep
he did
as
had commanded
him
the
angel
of [the] Lord
and
received
the
wife
of him
and
not
knew
her
until
that
she had brought forth
a son
and
he called
the
name
of Him
Jesus
-
Now
Jesus
having been born
in
Bethlehem
-
of Judea
in
[the] days
of Herod
the
king
behold
Magi
from [the]
east
arrived
in
Jerusalem
saying
Where
is
the [One]
having been born
King
of the
Jews
We saw
for
of Him
the
star
in
the
east
and
are come
to worship
Him
Having heard
then
-
King
Herod
he was troubled
and
all
Jerusalem
with
him
And
having gathered together
all
the
chief priests
and
scribes
of the
people
he was inquiring
of
them
where
the
Christ
was to be born
-
And
they said
to him
In
Bethlehem
-
of Judea
thus
for
has it been written
through
the
prophet
And
you
Bethlehem
land
of Judah
by no means
least
are
among
the
rulers
of Judah
out
of you
for
will go forth
[One] leading
who
will shepherd
the
people
of Me
-
Israel
Then
Herod
secretly
having called
the
Magi
inquired exactly
of
them
the
time
of the
appearing
star
And
having sent
them
to
Bethlehem
he said
Having gone
search
carefully
for
the
Child
when
then
You shall have found [Him]
bring word back
to me
so that
I also
having come
may worship
Him
-
And
having heard
the
king
they went away
and
behold
the
star
which
they saw
in
the
east
went before
them
until
having arrived
it stood
over
where
was
the
Child
Having seen
now
the
star
they rejoiced [with]
joy
great
exceedingly
And
having come
into
the
house
they found
the
Child
with
Mary
the
mother
of Him
and
having fallen down
they worshiped
Him
and
having opened
the
treasures
of them
they offered
to Him
gifts
gold
and
frankincense
and
myrrh
And
having been divinely warned
in
a dream
not
to return
to
Herod
by
another
route
they withdrew
into
the
country
of them
Having withdrawn
then
of them
behold
an angel
of [the] Lord
appears
in
a dream
-
to Joseph
saying
Having arisen
take
the
Child
and
the
mother
of Him
and
flee
into
Egypt
and
remain
there
until
-
I should tell
you
is about
for
Herod
to seek
the
Child
-
to destroy
Him
-
And
having arisen
he took
the
Child
and
the
mother
of Him
by night
and
withdrew
into
Egypt
and
he remained
there
until
the
death
of Herod
so that
it might be fulfilled
that
having been spoken
by
[the] Lord
through
the
prophet
saying
Out
of Egypt
have I called
the
Son
of me
Then
Herod
having seen
that
he had been outwitted
by
the
Magi
was enraged
intensely
and
having sent forth
he put to death
all
the
boys
that [were]
in
Bethlehem
and
in
all
the
vicinity
of it
from
two years old
and
under
according to
the
time
which
he had ascertained
from
the
Magi
Then
was fulfilled
that
having been spoken
by
Jeremiah
the
prophet
saying
A voice
in
Ramah
was heard
weeping
and
mourning
great
Rachel
weeping [for]
the
children
of her
and
not
would
be comforted
because
no more
are they
Having died
now
-
of Herod
behold
an angel
of [the] Lord
appears
in
a dream
to
Joseph
in
Egypt
saying
Having arisen
take
the
Child
and
the
mother
of Him
and
go
into
[the] land
of Israel
they have died
for
those
seeking
the
life
of the
Child
-
And
having arisen
he took
the
Child
and
the
mother
of Him
and
came
into
[the] land
of Israel
Having heard
now
that
Archelaus
reigns over
-
Judea
in place of
the
father
of him
Herod
he was afraid
there
to go
having been divinely warned
now
in
a dream
he withdrew
into
the
district
-
of Galilee
and
having come
he dwelt
in
a city
being called
Nazareth
so that
it should be fulfilled
that
having been spoken
through
the
prophets
that
A Nazarene
He will be called
In
then
the
days
those
comes
John
the
Baptist
preaching
in
the
wilderness
-
of Judea
saying
Repent
has drawn near
for
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
This
for
is
the [One]
having been spoken of
through
Isaiah
the
prophet
saying
[The] voice
of one crying
in
the
wilderness
Prepare
the
way
of [the] Lord
straight
make
the
paths
of Him
Himself
now
-
John
had
the
garment
of him
of
hair
of a camel
and
a belt
of leather
around
the
waist
of him
-
and
the food
was
of him
locusts
and
honey
wild
At that time
were going out
to
him
Jerusalem
and
all
-
Judea
and
all
the
region around
the
Jordan
and
were being baptized
in
the
Jordan
River
by
him
confessing
the
sins
of them
Having seen
now
many
of the
Pharisees
and
Sadducees
coming
to
the
baptism
he said
to them
Brood
of vipers
who
forewarned
you
to flee
from
the
coming
wrath
Produce
therefore
fruit
worthy
-
of repentance
And
not
presume
to say
within
yourselves
[As] father
we have
-
Abraham
I say
for
to you
that
able is
-
God
out of
the
stones
these
to raise up
children
unto
Abraham
Already
now
the
ax
to
the
root
of the
trees
is applied
every
therefore
tree
not
producing
fruit
good
is cut down
and
into
[the] fire
is thrown
I
indeed
you
baptize
with
water
to
repentance
-
but
after
me
is coming
mightier
than I
He
of whom
not
I am
fit
the
sandals
to carry
He
you
will baptize
with
[the] Spirit
Holy
and
with fire
whose
-
winnowing fork [is]
in
the
hand
of Him
and
He will clear
the
threshing floor
of Him
and
will gather
the
wheat
of Him
into
the
barn
the
but
chaff
He will burn up
with fire
unquenchable
Then
comes
-
Jesus
from
-
Galilee
to
the
Jordan
unto
-
John
-
to be baptized
by
him
-
But
was hindering
Him
saying
I
need
have
by
You
to be baptized
and
You
come
to
me
Answering
however
-
Jesus
said
him
Permit [it]
presently
thus
for
fitting
it is
to us
to fulfill
all
righteousness
Then
he permits
Him
Having been baptized
now
-
Jesus
immediately
went up
from
the
water
and
behold
were opened
the
heavens
and
he saw
Spirit
God
descending
as
a dove
alighting
upon
Him
And
behold
a voice
out
of the
heavens
saying
This
is
the
Son
of me
the
beloved
in
whom
I was well pleased
Then
-
Jesus
was led up
into
the
wilderness
by
the
Spirit
to be tempted
by
the
devil
And
having fasted
days
forty
and
forty
nights
afterward
He was hungry
And
having come
the
[one] tempting
he said
to Him
If
Son
You are
-
of God
speak
that
the
stones
these
loaves of bread
might become
-
But
answering
He said
It has been written
Not
by
bread
alone
shall live
the
man
but
by
every
word
coming out
of
[the] mouth
of God
Then
takes
Him
the
devil
to
the
holy
city
and
sets
Him
upon
the
pinnacle
of the
temple
and
says
to him
If
Son
You are
-
of God
throw
Yourself
down
it has been written
for
-
To the
angels
of Him
He will give orders
concerning
You
and
in
[their] hands
will they bear up
You
lest
ever
You strike
against
a stone
the
foot
of You
Said
to him
-
Jesus
Again
it has been written
Not
you shall test
[the] Lord
the
God
of you
Again
takes
Him
the
devil
to
a mountain
high
exceedingly
and
shows
to Him
all
the
kingdoms
of the
world
and
the
glory
of them
and
he says
to Him
These things
to You
all
will I give
if
falling down
You will worship
me
Then
says
to him
-
Jesus
Get you away
Satan
it has been written
for
[The] Lord
the
God
of you
you shall worship
and
Him
alone
shall you serve
Then
leaves
Him
the
devil
and
behold
angels
came
and
were ministering
to Him
Having heard
now
that
John
had been delivered up
He withdrew
into
-
Galilee
And
having left
-
Nazareth
having come
he dwelt
at
Capernaum
which
[is] on the sea-side
in
[the] region
of Zebulun
and
Naphtali
that
it might be fulfilled
that
having been spoken
by
Isaiah
the
prophet
saying
Land
of Zebulun
and
land
of Naphtali
way
of [the] sea
beyond
the
Jordan
Galilee
of the
Gentiles
The
people
-
sitting
in
darkness
a light
have seen
great
and
to those
sitting
in [the]
land
and
shadow
of death
a light
has dawned
on them
From
that time
began
-
Jesus
to proclaim
and
to say
Repent
has drawn near
for
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
Walking
now
beside
the
Sea
-
of Galilee
He saw
two
brothers
Simon
-
called
Peter
and
Andrew
the
brother
of him
casting
a net
into
the
sea
they were
for
fishermen
And
He says
to them
Come follow
after
Me
and
I will make
you
fishers
of men
-
And
immediately
having left
the
nets
they followed
Him
And
having gone on
from there
He saw
others
two
brothers
James
the [son]
-
of Zebedee
and
John
the
brother
of him
in
the
boat
with
Zebedee
the
father
of them
mending
the
nets
of them
and
He called
them
-
And
immediately
having left
the
boat
and
the
father
of them
they followed
Him
And
He was going
throughout
all
-
Galilee
teaching
in
the
synagogues
of them
and
proclaiming
the
gospel
of the
kingdom
and
healing
every
disease
and
every
sickness
among
the
people
And
went out
the
news
of Him
into
all
-
Syria
And
they brought
to Him
all
the
sick
having
various
diseases
and
pains
oppressing
being possessed by demons
and
being epileptics
and
paralytics
and
He healed
them
And
followed
Him
crowds
great
from
-
Galilee
and
[the] Decapolis
and
Jerusalem
and
Judea
and
beyond
the
Jordan
Having seen
then
the
crowds
He went up
on
the
mountain
and
having sat down
of Him
came
to Him
the
disciples
of Him
And
opening
the
mouth
of Him
He was teaching
them
saying
Blessed [are]
the
poor
in the
spirit
for
theirs
is
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
Blessed [are]
those
mourning
for
they
will be comforted
Blessed
the
meek
for
they
will inherit
the
earth
Blessed [are]
those
hungering
and
thirsting for
-
righteousness
for
they
will be filled
Blessed [are]
the
merciful
for
they
will receive mercy
Blessed
the
pure
-
in heart
for
they
-
God
will see
Blessed
the
peacemakers
for
they
sons
of God
will be called
Blessed [are]
those
having been persecuted
on account of
righteousness
for
theirs
is
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
Blessed
are you
when
they shall insult
you
and
shall persecute [you]
and
shall say
all kinds of
evil
against
you
lying
on account of
Me
Rejoice
and
exult
for
the
reward
of you
[is] great
in
the
heavens
thus
for
they persecuted
the
prophets
-
before
you
You
are
the
salt
of the
earth
if
however
the
salt
becomes tasteless
with
what
will it be salted
For
nothing
it is potent
any longer
if
not
having been cast
out
to be trampled upon
by
-
men
You
are
the
light
of the
world
Not
is able
a city
to be hidden
on
a hill
lying
Nor
do they light
a lamp
and
put
it
under
-
a basket
but
upon
the
lampstand
and
it shines
for all
those
in
the
house
Thus
let shine
the
light
of you
before
-
men
so that
they may see
your
-
good
works
and
they should glorify
the
Father
of you
-
in
the
heavens
Not
think
that
I have come
to abolish
the
law
or
the
Prophets
not
I have come
to abolish
but
to fulfill
Truly
for
I say
to you
until
-
shall pass away
the
heaven
and
the
earth
iota
one
or
one
stroke of a letter
no
not
shall pass away
from
the
law
until
-
everything
should happen
Whoever
if
then
shall break
one
of the
commandments
of these
the
least
and
shall teach
so
the
others
least
he will be called
in
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
whoever
now
-
shall keep
and
shall teach [them]
this [one]
great
will be called
in
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
I say
for
to you
that
if
not
shall abound
your
-
righteousness
above [that]
of the
scribes
and
Pharisees
no
not
shall you enter
into
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
You have heard
that
it was said
to the
ancients
Not
you shall murder
whoever
now
-
shall murder
liable
will be
to the
judgment
I
however
say
to you
that
everyone
-
being angry with
the
brother
of him
liable
will be
to the
judgment
whoever
now
-
shall say
to
brother
of him
Raca
liable
will be
to the
Sanhedrin
whoever
now
-
shall say
Fool
liable
will be
to
the
hell
-
of fire
If
therefore
you shall offer
the
gift
of you
at
the
altar
and there
shall remember
that
the
brother
of you
has
something
against
you
leave
there
the
gift
of you
before
the
altar
and
go away
first
be reconciled
to
brother
of you
and
then
having come
offer
the
gift
of you
Be
agreeing
with
accuser
of you
quickly
while
which
you are
with
him
on
the
way
lest
ever
you
deliver
the
accuser
to the
judge
and
the
judge
to the
officer
and
into
prison
you will be cast
Truly
I say
to you
no
not
shall you come out
from there
until
-
you should pay
the
last
kodranten
You have heard
that
it was said
Not
shall you commit adultery
I
however
say
to you
that
everyone
-
looking upon
a woman
in order
-
to lust after
her
already
has committed adultery with
her
in
the
heart
of him
If
now
the
eye
of you
-
right
causes to stumble
you
pluck out
it
and
cast [it]
from
you
it is better
indeed
for you
that
should perish
one
of the
members
of you
and
not
all
the
body
of you
should be cast
into
hell
And
if
the
right
of you
hand
causes to stumble
you
cut off
it
and
cast [it]
from
you
it is better
indeed
for you
that
should perish
one
of the
members
of you
and
not
all
the
body
of you
into
hell
should depart
It was said
also
Whoever
-
shall divorce
the
wife
of him
let him give
to her
a letter of divorce
I
however
say
to you
that
everyone
-
divorcing
the
wife
of him
except
on account
of sexual immorality
causes
her
to commit adultery
And
whoever
if
her having been divorced
shall marry
commits adultery
Again
you have heard
that
it was said
to the
ancients
Not
shall you swear falsely
you shall keep
now
to the
Lord
the
oaths
of you
I
however
say
to you
not
to swear
at all
neither
by
-
heaven
because
[the] throne
it is
-
of God
nor
by
the
earth
because
[the] footstool
it is
of the
feet
of Him
nor
by
Jerusalem
because
[the] city
it is
of the
great
King
Neither
by
the
head
of you
shall you swear
because
not
you are able
one
hair
white
to make
or
black
Let it be
however
the
statement
of you
Yes
âYes
[and] âNo
No
The
however
more than
these
from
-
evil
comes
You have heard
that
it was said
Eye
for
eye
and
tooth
for
tooth
I
however
say
to you
not
to resist
the
evil [person]
Instead
whoever
you
shall strike
on
the
right
cheek
of you
turn
to him
also
the
other
and
to the one
willing
you
to sue
and
the
tunic
of you
to take
yield
to him
also
the
cloak
and
whoever
you
shall compel to go
mile
one
go
with
him
two
To the [one]
asking of
you
give
and
the [one]
desiring
from
you
to borrow
not
you shall turn away from
You have heard
that
it was said
You shall love
-
neighbor
of you
and
shall hate
-
enemy
of you
I
however
say
to you
love
the
enemies
of you
and
pray
for
those
persecuting
you
so that
you may be
sons
of the
Father
of you
who is
in
[the] heavens
For
the
sun
of Him
He makes rise
on
evil
and
good
and
He sends rain
on
righteous
and
unrighteous
If
for
you love
those
loving
you
what
reward
have you
Do not
also
the
tax collectors
the
same
do
And
if
you greet
the
brothers
of you
only
what
extraordinary
do you
Do not
also
the
Gentiles
the
same
do
Shall be
therefore
you
perfect
as
the
Father
of you
who [is]
Heavenly
perfect
is
Beware
now
the
righteousness
of you
not
to do
before
-
men
in order
-
to be seen
by them
if
now
otherwise
reward
not
have you
with
the
Father
of you
who [is]
in
the
heavens
When
therefore
you do
acts of charity
not
do sound a trumpet
before
you
as
the
hypocrites
do
in
the
synagogues
and
in
the
streets
so that
they may have glory
from
-
men
Truly
I say
to you
they have
the
reward
of them
You
however
doing
charity
not
let know
the
left [hand]
of you
what
is doing
the
right hand
of you
so that
may be
your
-
giving
in
-
secret
And
the
Father
of you
the [One]
seeing
in
-
secret
will reward
you
And
when
you pray
not
you shall be
like
the
hypocrites
for
they love
in
the
synagogues
and
on
the
corners
of the
streets
standing
to pray
so that
they might be seen
-
by men
Truly
I say
to you
they have
the
reward
of them
You
however
when
you pray
enter
into
the
room
of you
and
having shut
the
door
of you
pray
to
Father
of you
the [One]
in
-
secret
And
the
Father
of you
the [One]
seeing
in
-
secret
will reward
you
Praying
now
not
do use vain repetitions
like
the
pagans
they think
for
that
in
the
many words
of them
they will be heard
Not
therefore
be like
to them
knows
for
the
Father
of you
of what things
need
you have
before
-
your
asking
Him
Thus
therefore
pray
you
Father
of us
who [is]
in
the
heavens
hallowed be
the
name
of You
Come
the
kingdom
of You
be done
the
will
of You
as
in
heaven
[so] also
upon
earth
The
bread
of us
-
daily
grant
us
today
And
forgive
us
the
debts
of us
as
also
we
forgive
the
debtors
of us
And
not
lead
us
into
temptation
but
deliver
us
from
-
evil
If
for
you forgive
-
men
the
trespasses
of them
will forgive
also
you
the
Father
of you
-
Heavenly
If
however
not
you forgive
-
men
neither
the
Father
of you
will forgive
the
trespasses
of you
Whenever
now
you fast
not
be
like
the
hypocrites
gloomy
they disfigure
for
the
appearance
of them
so that
they might appear
-
to men
[as] fasting
Truly
I say
to you
they have
the
reward
of them
You
however
fasting
anoint
your
-
head
and
the
face
of you
wash
so that
not
you might appear
-
to men
[as] fasting
but
-
to Father
your
the [One]
in
-
secret
and
the
Father
of you
the [One]
seeing
in
-
secret
will reward
you
Not
store up
for yourselves
treasures
upon
the
earth
where
moth
and
rust
destroy
and
where
thieves
break in
and
steal
store up
however
for yourselves
treasures
in
heaven
where
neither
moth
nor
rust
destroy
and
where
thieves
not
do break in
nor
steal
Where
for
is
the
treasure
of you
there
will be
also
the
heart
of you
The
lamp
of the
body
is
the
eye
If
therefore
is
the
eye
of you
clear
[the] whole
-
body
of you
full of light
will be
If
however
the
eye
of you
evil
is
all
the
body
of you
full of darkness
will be
If
then
the
light
that [is]
within
you
darkness
is
that
darkness
how great
No one
is able
two
masters
to serve
either
for
the
one
he will hate
and
the
other
he will love
or
[the] one
he will be devoted to
and
the
other
he will despise
Not
you are able
God
to serve
and
money
Because of
this
I say
to you
not
be anxious about
the
life
of you
what
you should eat
or
what
you should drink
nor
the
body
of you
what
you should put on
Not
the
life
more
is
than the
food
and
the
body
than
clothing
Look
at
the
birds
of the
air
that
not
they sow
nor
do they reap
nor
do they gather
into
barns
and
the
Father
of you
-
Heavenly
feeds
them
Not
you
much
are more valuable
than they
Who
now
from
you
being anxious
is able
to add
to
the
lifespan
of him
hour
one
And
about
clothing
why
are you anxious
Observe
the
lilies
of the
field
how
they grow
[They do] not
labor
nor
do they spin
I say
however
to you
that
not even
Solomon
in
all
the
glory
of him
was adorned
like
one
of these
If
however
the
grass
of the
field
today
being [here]
and
tomorrow
into
the furnace
being thrown
-
God
thus
clothes
[will He] not
much
more
you
O [you] of little faith
Not
therefore
be anxious
saying
What
shall we eat
Or
what
shall we drink
Or
what
shall we wear
All
for
these things
the
Gentiles
seek after
knows
for
the
Father
of you
-
Heavenly
that
you have need
of them
all
Seek
however
first
the
kingdom
and
the
righteousness
of Him
and
these things
all
will be added
to you
Not
therefore
be anxious
about
things
tomorrow
-
for
tomorrow
will be anxious about
itself
Sufficient
to the
day [is]
the
trouble
of it
Not
do judge
that
not
you should be judged
With
whatever
for
verdict
you judge
you will be judged
and
with
whatever
measure
you measure
it will be measured again
to you
Why
now
do you look at
the
splinter
that [is]
in
the
eye
the
brother
of you
-
and
the in
-
your [own]
eye
beam
not
notice
Or
how
shall you say
to the
brother
of you
Permit that
I might cast out
the
splinter
from
the
eye
of you
and
behold
the
beam
[is] in
the
eye
of you
Hypocrite
Cast out
first
from
the
eye
of you
the
beam
and
then
you will see clearly
to cast out
the
splinter
from
the
eye
of the
brother
of you
Not
give
that which [is]
holy
to the
dogs
nor
cast
the
pearls
of you
before
the
pigs
not
lest
they shall trample upon
them
with
the
feet
of them
and
having turned
they tear to pieces
you
Ask
and
it will be given
to you
seek
and
you will find
knock
and
it will be opened
to you
Everyone
for
-
asking
receives
and
the [one]
seeking
finds
and
to the [one]
knocking
it will be opened
Or
which
is
of
you
a man
whom
will ask for
the
son
of him
bread
not
a stone
will he give
him
Or
also
a fish
he will ask for
not
a serpent
will he give
him
If
therefore
you
evil
being
know
gifts
good
to give
to the
children
of you
how much
more
the
Father
of you
who [is]
in
the
heavens
will give
good things
to those
asking
Him
All things
therefore
as many as
if
you might desire
that
should do
to you
the
men
so
also
you
do
to them
This
for
is
the
law
and
the
prophets
Enter
through
the
narrow
gate
For
wide [is]
the
gate
and
broad
the
way
-
leading
to
-
destruction
and
many
are
those
entering
through
it
For
small [is]
the
gate
and
compressed
the
way
-
leading
to
-
life
and
few
are
those
finding
it
But beware
of
the
false prophets
who
come
to
you
in
clothing
of sheep
inwardly
however
they are
wolves
ravenous
By
the
fruits
of them
you will know
them
Not
do they gather
from
thorns
grapes
or
from
thistles
figs
So
every
tree
good
fruits
good
produces
-
but
the bad
tree
fruits
bad
produces
Not
is able
a tree
good
fruits
bad
to produce
nor
a tree
bad
fruits
good
to produce
Every
tree
not
producing
fruit
good
is cut down
and
into
fire
is thrown
Then surely
by
the
fruits
of them
you will know
them
Not
everyone
-
saying
to Me
Lord
Lord
will enter
into
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
but
the [one]
doing
the
will
the
Father
of Me
who [is]
in
the
heavens
Many
will say
to Me
in
that
the
day
Lord
Lord
not
in
Your
name
did we prophesy
and
[in]
Your
name
demons
cast out
and
[in]
your
name
miracles
many
perform
And
then
I will declare
to them
-
Never
knew I
you
depart you
from
Me
those
working
-
lawlessness
Everyone
therefore
whoever
hears
My
-
words
these
and
does
them
will be like
a man
wise
who
built
his
-
house
upon
the
rock
And
came down
the
rain
and
came
the
torrents
and
blew
the
winds
and
beat
that
house
upon
and
not
it fell
it had been founded
for
upon
the
rock
And
everyone
-
hearing
My
-
words
these
and
not
doing
them
he will be likened
to a man
foolish
who
built
of him
the
house
upon
the
sand
And
came down
the
rain
and
came
the
torrents
and
blew
the
winds
and
beat
that
house
upon
and
it fell
and
was
the
fall
of it
great
And
it came to pass
when
had finished
-
Jesus
the
words
these
were astonished
the
crowds
at
the
teaching
of Him
He was
for
teaching
them
as
authority
having
and
not
as
the
scribes
of them
Having come down
now
He
from
the
mountain
followed
Him
crowds
great
And
behold
a leper
having come
was worshipping
Him
saying
Lord
if
You are willing
You are able
me
to cleanse
And
having stretched out
the
hand
He touched
him
saying
I am willing
be you cleansed
And
immediately
was cleansed
his
-
leprosy
And
says
to him
-
Jesus
See that
no one
you tell
But
go
yourself
show
to the
priest
and
offer
the
gift
that
commanded
Moses
for
a testimony
to them
Having entered
now
He
into
Capernaum
came
to Him
a centurion
imploring
Him
and
saying
Lord
the
servant
of me
is lying
in
the
house
paralyzed
grievously
tormented
He says
to him
I
having come
will heal
him
Answering
however
the
centurion
said
Lord
not
I am
worthy
that
of me
under
the
roof
You should come
but
only
speak
the word
and
will be healed
the
servant
of me
Also
for
I
a man
am
under
authority
having
under
me
soldiers
and
I say
to this [one]
Go
and
he goes
and
to another
Come
and
he comes
and
to
[the] servant
of me
Do
this
and
he does [it]
Having heard
now
-
Jesus
marveled
and
said
to those
following
Truly
I say
to you
except
no one
so great
faith
in
-
Israel
have I found
I say
now
to you
that
many
from
east
and
west
will come
and
will recline
with
Abraham
and
Isaac
and
Jacob
in
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
the
however
sons
of the
kingdom
will be cast out
into
the
darkness
the
outer
there
will be
the
weeping
and
the
gnashing
of the
teeth
And
said
-
Jesus
to the
centurion
Go
as
you have believed
be it
to you
And
was healed
the
servant
in
the
hour
that
And
having come
-
Jesus
to
the
house
of Peter
He saw
the
mother-in-law
of him
lying sick
and
fevering
And
He touched
the
hand
of her
and
left
her
the
fever
and
she arose
and
was ministering
to them
Evening
now
having come
they brought
to Him
being possessed with demons
many
and
He cast out
the
spirits
by a word
and
all
those
sick
being
He healed
so that
it might be fulfilled
that
having been spoken
by
Isaiah
the
prophet
saying
Himself
the
infirmities
of us
He took
and
our
diseases
bore
Having seen
now
-
Jesus
crowd
around
Him
He commanded
to depart
to
the
other side
And
having come to [him]
one
scribe
said
to Him
Teacher
I will follow
You
wherever
if
You might go
And
says
to him
-
Jesus
-
Foxes
holes
have
and
the
birds
of the
air
nests
-
but
the Son
-
of Man
no
has
[place] where
the
head
He might lay
Another
now
of the
disciples
said
to Him
Lord
allow
me
first
to go
and
to bury
the
father
of me
-
But
Jesus
said
to him
Follow
Me
and
leave
the
dead
to bury
-
their own
dead
And
having entered
He
into
the
boat
followed
Him
the
disciples
of Him
And
behold
a storm
great
arose
in
the
sea
so that
the
boat
was being swamped
by
the
waves
He Himself
however
was sleeping
And
having come to [Him]
they awoke
Him
saying
Lord
save us
we are perishing
And
He says
to them
Why
fearful
are you
O [you] of little faith
Then
having arisen
He rebuked
the
winds
and
the
sea
and
there was
a calm
great
-
And
the men
marveled
saying
What kind [of man]
is
this
that
even
the
winds
and
the
sea
Him
obey
And
having come
He
to
the
other side
to
the
region
of the
Gadarenes
met
Him
two
being possessed by demons
out of
the
tombs
coming forth
violent
extremely
so that
not
was able
anyone
to pass
by
the
way
that
And
behold
they cried out
saying
What
to us
and
to you
Son
-
of God
Are You come
here
before [the]
time
to torment
us
There was
now
far off
from
them
a herd
of pigs
many
feeding
-
And
the demons
were begging
Him
saying
If
You cast out
us
send away
us
into
the
herd
-
of pigs
And
He said
to them
Go
-
And
having gone out
they went away
into
the
pigs
and
behold
rushed
all
the
herd
down
the
steep bank
into
the
sea
and
perished
in
the
waters
Those
now
feeding [them]
fled
and
having gone away
into
the
city
they related
everything
including
the [matter]
of those
being possessed by demons
And
behold
all
the
city
went out
to
meet
-
Jesus
And
having seen
Him
they begged [Him]
that
He would depart
from
the
region
of them
And
having entered
into
a boat
He passed over
and
came
to
the
own
city
And
behold
they were bringing
to Him
a paralytic
on
a bed
lying
And
having seen
-
Jesus
the
faith
of them
He said
to the
paralytic
Take courage
son
have been forgiven
of you
the
sins
And
behold
some
of the
scribes
said
to
themselves
This [man]
blasphemes
And
having known
-
Jesus
the
thoughts
of them
He said
So that
why
think you
evil
in
the
hearts
of you
Which
for
is
easier
to say
Are forgiven
of you
the
sins
or
to say
Arise
and
walk
So that
however
you may know
that
authority
has
the
Son
-
of Man
on
the
earth
to forgive
sins
Then
He says
to the
paralytic
Having arisen
take up
your
-
mat
and
go
to
the
house
of you
And
having arisen
he went away
to
the
house
of him
Having seen
now
the
crowds
marveled
and
glorified
-
God
the [One]
having given
authority
such
-
to men
And
passing on
-
Jesus
from there
He saw
a man
sitting
at
the
tax booth
Matthew
named
And
He says
to him
Follow
Me
And
having arisen
he followed
Him
And
it came to pass
of Him
reclining
in
the
house
that
behold
many
tax collectors
and
sinners
having come
were reclining with
-
Jesus
and
the
disciples
of Him
And
having seen [it]
the
Pharisees
said
to
disciples
of Him
Because of
why
with
the
tax collectors
and
sinners
eats
the
Teacher
of you
-
And
having heard
He said
Not
need
have
those
being strong
of a physician
but
those
sick
being
Having gone
however
learn
what
is
Mercy
I desire
and
not
sacrifice
Not
for
I came
to call
[the] righteous
but
sinners
Then
come
to Him
the
disciples
of John
saying
Because of
why
we
and
the
Pharisees
do fast
the
however
disciples
of You
not
fast
And
said
to them
-
Jesus
Not
can
the
sons
of the
bridechamber
mourn
as
long as
with
them
is
the
bridegroom
Will come
however
days
when
shall have been taken away
from
them
the
bridegroom
and
then
they will fast
No one
however
puts
a patch
of cloth
unshrunk
on
clothing
old
tears away
for
the
patch
of it
from
the
garment
and
a worse
tear
emerges
Nor
pour they
wine
new
into
wineskins
old
if
now
lest
are burst
the
wineskins
and
the
wine
is poured out
and
the
wineskins
are destroyed
But
they pour
wine
new
into
wineskins
new
and
both
are preserved
These things
of Him
speaking
to them
behold
a ruler
certain
having come
was kneeling down
to Him
saying
-
The
daughter
of Me
presently
has died
but
having come
lay
the
hand
of You
upon
her
and
she will live
And
having arisen
-
Jesus
followed
him
also
the
disciples
of Him
And
behold
a woman
having had a flux of blood
twelve
years
having come up
behind [Him]
touched
the
fringe
of the
garment
of Him
She was saying
for
within
herself
If
only
I shall touch
the
garment
of Him
I will be healed
-
And
Jesus
having turned
and
having seen
her
said
Take courage
daughter
the
faith
of you
has cured
you
And
was cured
the
woman
from
the
hour
very
And
having come
-
Jesus
into
the
house
of the
ruler
and
having seen
the
flute players
and
the
crowd
making a commotion
He says
Go away
Not
for
is dead
the
girl
but
sleeps
And
they began to laugh at
Him
When
now
had been put outside
the
crowd
having entered
He took hold of
the
hand
of her
and
arose
the
girl
And
went out
the
report
this
into
all
the
land
that
And
passing on
from there
-
Jesus
followed
two
blind [men]
crying out
and
saying
Have mercy on
us
Son
of David
Having come
now
into
the
house
came
to Him
the
blind [men]
and
says
to them
-
Jesus
Believe you
that
I am able
this
to do
They say
to him
Yes
Lord
Then
He touched
the
eyes
of them
saying
According to
the
faith
of you
be it
to you
And
were opened
their
-
eyes
And
strictly instructed
them
-
Jesus
saying
See that
no one
knows
-
But
having gone out
they make known
Him
in
all
the
land
that
[As] they
now
were going out
behold
they brought
to Him
mute
possessed by a demon
And
having been cast out
the
demon
spoke
the
mute [man]
And
marveled
the
crowds
saying
Never
was it seen
thus
in
-
Israel
The
now
Pharisees
were saying
By
the
prince
of the
demons
He casts out
-
demons
And
was going throughout
-
Jesus
the
cities
all
and
the
villages
teaching
in
the
synagogues
of them
and
proclaiming
the
gospel
of the
kingdom
and
healing
every
disease
and
every
sickness
Having seen
now
the
crowds
He was moved with compassion
for
them
because
they were
wearied
and
cast away
as
sheep
not
having
a shepherd
Then
He says
to the
disciples
of Him
The
indeed
harvest
[is] plentiful
the
however
workmen
[are] few
Beseech
therefore
the
Lord
of the
harvest
that
He might send out
workmen
into
the
harvest
of Him
And
having summoned
the
twelve
disciples
of Him
He gave
to them
authority
over spirits
unclean
so as
to cast out
them
and
to heal
every
disease
and
every
sickness
-
And
of the twelve
apostles
the
names
are
these
first
Simon
-
called
Peter
and
Andrew
the
brother
of him
and
James
the [son]
of
Zebedee
and
John
the
brother
of him
Philip
and
Bartholomew
Thomas
and
Matthew
the
tax collector
James
the [son]

of Alphaeus
and
Thaddaeus
Simon
the
Zealot
and
Judas
-
Iscariot
the [one]
also
having betrayed
Him
These
-
twelve
sent forth
-
Jesus
having instructed
them
saying
Into
[the] way
of the Gentiles
not
go off
and
into
any city
of [the] Samaritans
not
enter
go
however
rather
to
those
sheep
-
being lost
of [the] house
of Israel
Going on
also
proclaim
saying
-
Has drawn near
The
kingdom
of the
heavens
[Those] ailing
heal
dead
raise
lepers
cleanse
demons
cast out
freely
you received
freely
give
Neither
take along
gold
nor
silver
nor
copper
in
the
belts
of you
nor
provision-bag
for
[the] way
nor
two
tunics
nor
sandals
nor
a staff
worthy [is]
for
the
workman
of the
provisions
of him
Into
whatever
now
-
city
or
village
you enter
inquire
who
in
it
worthy
is
and there
remain
until
-
you go forth
Entering
now
into
the
house
greet
it
And
if
indeed
be
the
house
worthy
let come
the
peace
of you
upon
it
if
however
not
it be
worthy
the
peace
of you
to
you
let return
And
whoever
-
not
will receive
you
nor
will hear
the
words
of you
going forth
out
of the
house
or
of the
city
that
shake off
the
dust
of the
feet
of you
Truly
I say
to you
More tolerable
it will be
for [the] land
of Sodom
and
of Gomorrah
on
day
of judgment
than
the
city
for that
Behold
I
send forth
you
as
sheep
in
[the] midst
of wolves
be you
therefore
shrewd
as
the
serpents
and
innocent
as
the
doves
Beware
however
of
-
men
they will deliver
for
you
into
courts
and
in
the
synagogues
of them
they will flog
you
and
before
governors
also
and
kings
you will be brought
on account of
Me
for
a testimony
to them
and
to the
Gentiles
When
then
they deliver up
you
not
be anxious
how
or
what
you should speak
it will be given
for
you
in
that
-
hour
what
you should say
Not
for
you
are
those
speaking
but
the
Spirit
of the
Father
of you
-
speaking
through
you
Will deliver up
now
brother
brother
to
death
and
father
child
And
will rise up
children
against
parents
and
will put to death
them
And
you will be
hated
by
all
on account of
the
name
of Me
the [one]
however
having endured
to
[the] end
he
will be saved
Whenever
then
they persecute
you
in
the
city
one
flee
to
the
next
Truly
for
I say
to you
no
not
shall you have completed
the
cities
of
Israel
until
be come
the
Son
of
Man
Not
is
a disciple
above
the
teacher
nor
a servant
above
the
master
of him
[It is] sufficient
for the
disciple
that
he become
as
the
teacher
of him
and
the
servant
as
the
master
of him
If
the
master of the house
Beelzebul
they called
how much
more
those
house members
of him
Not
therefore
you should fear
them
nothing
for
is
concealed
which
not
will be revealed
or
hidden
which
not
will be known
What
I tell
you
in
the
darkness
speak
in
the
light
and
what
in
the
ear
you hear
proclaim
upon
the
housetops
And
not
you should be afraid
of
those
killing
the
body
the
however
soul
not
being able
to kill
you should fear
however
rather
the [One]
being able
both
soul
and
body
to destroy
in
hell
Not
two
sparrows
for an assarion
are sold
And
one
of
them
not
will fall
to
the
ground
apart from
the
Father
of you
Of you
now
even
the
hairs
of the
head
all
numbered
are
Not
therefore
you should fear
than many
sparrows
are worth more
you
Everyone
therefore
who
will confess
in
Me
before
-
men
will confess
also I
in
him
before
the
Father
of Me
who [is]
in
the
heavens
Whoever
now
-
shall deny
Me
before
-
men
will deny
I also
him
before
the
Father
of Me
who [is]
in
the
heavens
Not
think
that
I came
to bring
peace
to
the
earth
not
I came
to bring
peace
but
a sword
I came
for
to set at variance
A man
against
the
father
of him
and
a daughter
against
the
mother
of her
and
a daughter-in-law
against
the
mother-in-law
of her
And
enemies
of the
man
the
household
of him
The [one]
loving
father
or
mother
above
Me
not
is
of Me
worthy
and
the [one]
loving
son
or
daughter
above
Me
not
is
of Me
worthy
And
he who
not
takes
the
cross
of him
and
follows
after
Me
not
is
of Me
worthy
The [one]
having found
the
life
of him
will lose
it
and
the [one]
having lost
the
life
of him
on account of
Me
will find
it
The [One]
receiving
you
Me
receives
and
the [one]
Me
receiving
receives
the [One]
having sent
Me
The [one]
receiving
a prophet
in [the]
name
of a prophet
[the] reward
of a prophet
will receive
and
the [one]
receiving
a righteous [man]
in [the]
name
of a righteous [man]
the reward
of a righteous [man]
will receive
And
whoever
-
shall give to drink
one
the
little ones
of these
a cup
of cold [water]
only
in [the]
name
of a disciple
truly
I say
to you
no
not
shall he lose
the
reward
of him
And
it came to pass
when
had finished
-
Jesus
commanding
the
twelve
disciples
of Him
He departed
from there
-
to teach
and
to preach
in
the
cities
of them
-
And
John
having heard
in
the
prison
the
works
of the
Christ
having sent
two
of the
disciples
of him
said
to Him
You
are
the
coming [One]
or
another
are we to look for
And
answering
-
Jesus
said
to them
Having gone
relate
to John
what
you hear
and
see
Blind
receive sight
and
lame
walk
lepers
are cleansed
and
deaf
hear
and
dead
are raised
and
poor
are gospelized
And
blessed
is
he who
if
not
shall fall away
in
Me
As these
now
were going away
began
-
Jesus
to speak
to the
crowds
concerning
John
What
went you out
into
the
wilderness
to see
A reed
by [the]
wind
shaken
But
what
did you go out
to see
A man
in
delicate [clothing]
having been dressed
Behold
those
-
delicate [clothing]
wearing
in
the
houses
-
of kings
But
what
did you go out
a prophet
to see
Yes
I say
to you
and [one]
more excellent
than a prophet
For this
is [he]
concerning
whom
it has been written
Behold
I
send
the
messenger
of Me
before
[the] face
of You
who
will prepare
the
way
of You
before
You
Truly
I say
to you
not
there has risen
among [those]
born
of women
one greater
than John
the
Baptist
-
Yet
the least
in
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
greater
than he
is
From
then
the
days
of John
the
Baptist
until
now
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
is taken by violence
and [the]
violent
claim
it
All
for
the
prophets
and
the
law
until
John
prophesied
And
if
you are willing
to receive [it]
he
is
Elijah
the one
being about
to come
The [one]
having
ears
let him hear
To what
however
will I compare
the
generation
this
Like
it is
little children
sitting
in
the
markets
and
calling out
-
to others
saying
We piped
for you
and
not
you did dance
we sang a dirge
and
not
you did wail
Came
for
John
neither
eating
nor
drinking
and
they say
A demon
he has
Came
the
Son
-
of Man
eating
and
drinking
and
they say
Behold
a man
a glutton
and
a drunkard
of tax collectors
a friend
and
of sinners
But
is justified
-
wisdom
by
the
deeds
of her
Then
He began
to denounce
the
cities
in
which
had taken place
the
most
miracles
of Him
because
not
they repented
Woe
to you
Chorazin
Woe
to you
Bethsaida
For
if
in
Tyre
and
Sidon
had taken place
the
miracles
-
having come to pass
in
you
long ago
then
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
they would have repented
But
I say
to you
for Tyre
and
Sidon
more tolerable
will it be
in
[the] day
of judgment
than
for you
And
you
Capernaum
not
to
heaven
will be exalted
to
Hades
will be brought down
For
if
in
Sodom
had taken place
the
miracles
-
having taken place
in
you
it would have remained
-
until
the
day
But
I say
to you
that
for [the] land
of Sodom
more tolerable
will it be
in
day
of judgment
than
for you
At
that
-
time
answering
-
Jesus
said
I fully consent
to You
Father
Lord
of the
heaven
and
the
earth
that
You did hide
these things
from
wise
and
learned
and
did reveal
them
to little children
Yes
-
Father
for
thus
well-pleasing
it was
before
You
All things
to Me
have been delivered
by
the
Father
of Me
And
no one
knows
the
Son
if
not
the
Father
nor
the
Father
anyone
does know
if
not
the
Son
and
to whom
if
might choose
the
Son
to reveal [Him]
Come
to
Me
all
those
toiling
and
being burdened
and I
will give rest
to you
Take
the
yoke
of Me
upon
you
and
learn
from
Me
for
gentle
I am
and
humble
[in] the
heart
and
you will find
rest
[for] the
souls
of you
The
for
yoke
of Me
[is] easy
and
the
burden
of Me
light
is
At
that
-
time
went
-
Jesus
on the
Sabbaths
through
the
grainfields
-
and
the disciples
of Him
were hungry
and
they began
to pluck [the]
heads of grain
and
to eat
-
And
the Pharisees
having seen
said
to Him
Behold
the
disciples
of You
are doing
what
not
it is lawful
to do
on
Sabbath
-
And
He said
to them
Not
you have read
what
did
David
when
he was hungry
and
those
with
him
how
he entered
into
the
house
-
of God
and
the
loaves
of the
presentation
they ate
which
not
lawful
it was
for him
to eat
nor
for those
with
him
if
not
for the
priests
only
Or
not
have you read
in
the
law
that
on the
Sabbath
the
priests
in
the
temple
the
Sabbath
profane
and
guiltless
are
I say
however
to you
that
the
temple
a greater than
is
here
If
however
you had known
what
is
Mercy
I desire
and
not
sacrifice
not
-
you would have condemned
the
guiltless
Lord
for
is
of the
Sabbath
the
Son
of
Man
And
having departed
from there
He went
into
the
synagogue
of them
And
behold
a man
a hand
having
withered
And
they asked
Him
saying
Is
it lawful
on the
Sabbaths
to heal
so that
they might accuse
Him
-
And
He said
to them
What
will there be
among
you
man
who
will have
sheep
one
and
if
falls
it
on the
Sabbaths
into
a pit
not
will he take hold of
it
and
will raise [it] up
How much
therefore
is more valuable
a man
than a sheep
Therefore
it is lawful
on the
Sabbaths
good
to do
Then
He says
to
[the] man
Stretch out
your
-
hand
And
he stretched [it] out
and
it was restored
sound
as
the
other
Having gone out
now
the
Pharisees
a counsel
held
against
Him
how
Him
they might destroy
-
And
Jesus
having known
withdrew
from there
And
followed
Him
great
and
He healed
them
all
and
He warned
them
that
not
known
Him
they should make
so that
might be fulfilled
that
having been spoken
by
Isaiah
the
prophet
saying
Behold
the
servant
of Me
whom
I have chosen
the
beloved
of Me
whom
has found delight
the
soul
of Me
I will put
the
Spirit
of Me
upon
Him
and
justice
to the
Gentiles
He will proclaim
Not
will He quarrel
nor
will he cry out
nor
will hear
anyone
in
the
streets
the
voice
of Him
A reed
bruised
not
He will break
and
a wick
smoldering
not
He will quench
until
-
He leads
to
victory
-
justice
And
in the
name
of Him
[the] Gentiles
will hope
Then
was brought
to Him
[one] possessed by a demon
blind
and
mute
and
He healed
him
in order for
the
mute [man]
to speak
and
to see
And
were amazed
all
the
crowds
and
were saying
Whether
this
is
the
son
of David
-
And
the Pharisees
having heard
said
This [man]
not
casts out
the
demons
if
not
by
-
Beelzebul
prince
of the
demons
Having known
now
the
thoughts
of them
He said
to them
Every
kingdom
having been divided
against
itself
is brought to desolation
and
every
city
or
house
having been divided
against
itself
not
will stand
And
if
-
Satan
-
Satan
casts out
against
himself
he is divided
How
then
will stand
the
kingdom
of him
And
if
I
by
Beelzebul
cast out
-
demons
the
sons
of you
by
whom
do they cast out
On account of
this
they
judges
will be
of you
If
however
by [the]
Spirit
of God
I
cast out
-
demons
then
has come
upon
you
the
kingdom
-
of God
Or
how
is able
anyone
to enter
into
the
house
of the
strong [man]
and
the
goods
of him
to plunder
if
not
first
he bind
the
strong [man]
And
then
the
house
of him
he will plunder
The [one]
not
being
with
Me
against
Me
is
and
the [one]
not
gathering
with
Me
scatters
Because of
this
I say
to you
every
sin
and
blasphemy
will be forgiven
-
men
-
however
against
[the] Spirit
blasphemy
not
will be forgiven
And
whoever
if
speaks
a word
against
the
Son
-
of Man
it will be forgiven
him
whoever
now
-
speaks
against
-
Spirit
the
Holy
not
it will be forgiven
him
neither
in
this
-
age
nor
in
the
coming [one]
Either
make
the
tree
good
and
the
fruit
of it
good
or
make
the
tree
bad
and
the
fruit
of it
bad
by
for
the
fruit
the
tree
is known
Offspring
of vipers
how
are you able
good things
to speak
evil
being
Out of
for
the
abundance
of the
heart
the
mouth
speaks
The
good
man
out of
his
good
treasure
puts forth
good things
and
the
evil
man
out of
his
evil
treasure
puts forth
evil things
I say
now
to you
that
every
word
careless
that
will speak
-
men
they will give
of
it
an account
in
day
of judgment
By
for
the
words
of you
you will be justified
and
by
the
words
of you
you will be condemned
Then
answered
him
some
of the
scribes
and
Pharisees
saying
Teacher
we wish
from
You
a sign
to see
-
And
answering
He said
to them
A generation
evil
and
adulterous
a sign
seeks for
and
a sign
not
will be given
to it
if
not
the
sign
of Jonah
the
prophet
Just as
for
was
Jonah
in
the
belly
of the
great fish
three
days
and
three
nights
so
will be
the
Son
-
of Man
in
the
heart
of the
earth
three
days
and
three
nights
The men
of Nineveh
will stand up
in
the
judgment
with
the
generation
this
and
will condemn
it
for
they repented
at
the
preaching
of Jonah
and
behold
greater
than Jonah
here
The queen
of [the] south
will rise up
in
the
judgment
with
the
generation
this
and
will condemn
it
for
she came
from
the
ends
of the
earth
to hear
the
wisdom
of Solomon
and
behold
greater
than Solomon
here
When
now
the
unclean
spirit
is gone out
from
the
man
it passes
through
waterless
places
seeking
rest
and
none
finds [it]
Then
it says
To
the
house
of me
I will return
from where
I came out
And
having come
it finds [it]
being unoccupied
and
swept
and
put in order
Then
it goes
and
takes
with
itself
seven
other
spirits
more evil
than itself
and
having entered in
they dwell
there
and
becomes
the
last
of the
man
that
worse
than the
first
So
it will be
also
unto
generation
this
the
evil
While
He
was speaking
to the
crowds
behold
the
mother
and
the
brothers
of Him
were standing
outside
seeking
to Him
to speak
Said
now
someone
to Him
Behold
the
mother
of You
and
the
brothers
of you
outside
are standing
seeking
to You
to speak
-
And
answering
He said
to the [one]
telling
Him
Who
is
the
mother
of Me
and
who
are
the
brothers
of Me
And
having stretched out
the
hand
of Him
to
the
disciples
of Him
He said
Behold
the
mother
of Me
and
the
brothers
of Me
Whoever
for
-
shall do
the
will
the
Father
of Me
who [is]
in
[the] heavens
he
My
brother
and
sister
and
mother
is
In
the
day
that
having gone forth
-
Jesus
[from] the
house
was sitting
by
the
sea
And
were gathered together
to
Him
crowds
great
so that
He
into
a boat
having entered
sat down
and
all
the
crowd
on
the
shore
stood
And
He spoke
to them
many things
in
parables
saying
Behold
went out
the [one]
sowing
-
to sow
And
in
-
sowing
of him
some
indeed
fell
along
the
road
and
having come
the
birds
devoured
them
Other
now
fell
upon
the
rocky places
where
not
it had
soil
much
and
immediately
it sprang up
through
-
not
having
depth
of soil
[the] sun
now
having risen
they were scorched
and
through
the
not
having
root
were dried up
Other
now
fell
upon
the
thorns
and
grew up
the
thorns
and
choked
them
Other
now
fell
upon
the
soil
-
good
and
were yielding
fruit
some
indeed
a hundredfold
some
now
sixty
some
now
thirty
The [one]
having
ears
let him hear
And
having come to [Him]
the
disciples
said
to Him
Because of
why
in
parables
speak You
to them
-
And
answering
He said
Because
to you
it has been granted
to know
the
mysteries
of the
kingdom
of the
heavens
to them
however
not
it has been granted
Whoever
for
has
will be given
to him
and
he will be in abundance
whoever
now
not
has
even
what
he has
will be taken away
from
him
Because of
this
in
parables
to them
I speak
Because
seeing
not
do they see
and
hearing
not
do they hear
nor
do they understand
And
is fulfilled
in them
the
prophecy
of Isaiah
-
saying
In hearing
you will hear
and
no
not
understand
and
seeing
you will see
and
no
not
perceive
Has grown dull
for
the
heart
of the
people
this
and
with the
ears
barely
they have heard
and
the
eyes
of them
they have closed
not
lest
they should see
with the
eyes
and
with the
ears
they should hear
and
with the
heart
they should understand
and
should return
and
I will heal
them
Of you
however
blessed
[are] the
eyes
because
they see
and
the
ears
of you
because
they hear
Truly
for
I say
to you
that
many
prophets
and
righteous [men]
longed
to see
what
you see
and
not
saw
and
to hear
what
you hear
and
not
heard
You
therefore
hear
the
parable
of the [one]
having sown
Everyone
hearing
the
word
of the
kingdom
and
not
understanding
comes
the
evil one
and
snatches away
that
having been sown
in
the
heart
of him
This
is
the [one]
on
the
path
having been sown
That which
now
upon
the
rocky places
having been sown
this
is
the [one]
the

no
he has
now
root
in
himself
but
temporary
is
having come
however
tribulation
or
persecution
on account of
the
word
immediately
he falls away
That which
now
among
the
thorns
having been sown
this
is
the [one]
the
word
hearing
and
the
care
-
present age
and
the
deceit
-
of riches

the

unfruitful
it becomes
That
however
on
the
good
soil
having been sown
this
is
the [one]
the
word

and
understanding

indeed
brings forth fruit
and
produces
some

some

Another
parable
put He before
them
saying
Has become like
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
a man
having sown
good
seed
in
the
field
of him
In
now
the [time]
are sleeping
the
men
came
his
-
enemy
and
sowed
weeds
in [the]
midst
of the
wheat
and
went away
When
now
sprouted
the
plants
and
fruit
produced
then
appeared
also
the
weeds
Having come to [him]
now
the
servants
the
master of the house
said
to him
Sir
not
good
seed
did you sow
in
-
your
field
How
then
has it
the weeds
-
And
he said
to them
An enemy
a man
this
did
-
And
the servants
to him
said
Do you desire
then
[that] having gone forth
we should gather
them
-
And
he said
No
not
lest
gathering
the
weeds
you would uproot
with
them
the
wheat
Allow
to grow together
both
until
the
harvest
and
in
the time
of the
harvest
I will say
to the
harvesters
Gather
first
the
weeds
and
bind
them
into
bundles
in order
-
to burn
them
-
and
the wheat
gather together
into
the
barn
of me
Another
parable
put He before
them
saying
Like
is
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
to a grain
of mustard
which
having taken
a man
sowed
in
the
field
of him
which
smallest
indeed
is
of all
the
seeds
when
however
it is grown
greater
than the
garden plants
it is
and
becomes
a tree
so that
come
the
birds
of the
air
and
perch
in
the
branches
of it
Another
parable
spoke He
to them
Like
is
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
to leaven
which
having taken
a woman
hid
in
of flour
measures
three
until
of it
was leavened
all
These things
all
spoke
-
Jesus
in
parables
to the
crowds
and
without
a parable
not
He was speaking
to them
so that
might be fulfilled
that
having been spoken
by
the
prophet
saying
I will open
in
parables
the
mouth
of Me
I will utter
things hidden
from
[the] foundation
Then
having dismissed
the
crowds
He went
into
the
house
And
came
to Him
the
disciples
of Him
saying
Explain
to us
the
parable
of the
weeds
of the
field
-
And
answering
He said
The [One]
sowing
the
good
seed
is
the
Son
-
of Man
-
and
the field
is
the
world
-
and
the good
seed
these
are
the
sons
of the
kingdom
-
and
the weeds
are
the
sons
of the
evil [one]
-
and
the enemy
-
having sown
them
is
the
devil
-
and
the harvest
[the] consummation
of the age
is
-
and
the harvesters
angels
are
As
therefore
is gathered
the
weeds
and
in fire
is consumed
thus
it will be
in
the
consummation
of the
age
Will send forth
the
Son
-
of Man
the
angels
of Him
and
they will gather
out of
the
kingdom
of Him
all
the
causes of sin
and
those
practicing
-
lawlessness
and
they will cast
them
into
the
furnace
of the
fire
there
will be
the
weeping
and
the
gnashing
of
teeth
Then
the
righteous
will shine forth
as
the
sun
in
the
kingdom
of the
Father
of them
The [one]
having
ears
let him hear
Like
is
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
treasure
having been hidden
in
the
field
which
having found
a man
hid
and
for
the
joy
of it
goes
and
he sells
that
he has
and
buys
the
field
that
Again
like
is
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
a merchant
seeking
fine
pearls
having found
now
one
very precious
pearl
having gone away
he has sold
all things
as many as
he had
and
bought
it
Again
like
is
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
a dragnet
having been cast
into
the
sea
and
of
every
kind
having gathered together
which
when
it was filled
having drawn up
on
the
shore
and
having sat down
they collected
the
good
into
vessels
the
and
bad
out
they cast
Thus
will it be
in
the
consummation
of the
age
will go out
the
angels
and
will separate
the
evil
from
[the] midst
of the
righteous
and
will cast
them
into
the
furnace
of the
fire
There
will be
the
weeping
and
the
gnashing
of the
teeth
Have you understood
these things
all
They say
to Him
Yes
-
And
He said
to them
Because of
this
every
scribe
having been discipled
into the
kingdom
of the
heavens
like
is
a man
a master of a house
who
puts forth
out of
the
treasure
of him
[things] new
and
old
And
it came to pass
when
had finished
-
Jesus
the
parables
these
He withdrew
from there
And
having come
into
the
region
His [own]
He was teaching
them
in
the
synagogue
of them
so that
are astonished
they
and
are saying
From where
to this [man]
the
wisdom
this
and
the
miraculous powers
Not
this
is
the
of the
carpenter
Son
[Is] not
the
mother
of Him
called
Mary
And
the
brothers
of Him
James
and
Joseph
and
Simon
and
Judas
And
the
sisters
of Him
not
all
with
us
are
From where
then
to this [man]
these things
all
And
they were offended
at
Him
-
But
Jesus
said
to them
Not
is
a prophet
without Honor
if
not
in
the
hometown
and
in
the
household
of him
And
not
He did
there
miracles
many
because of
the
unbelief
of them
At
that
-
time
heard
Herod
the
tetrarch
the
news
of Jesus
and
he said
to
[the] servants
of him
This
is
John
the
Baptist
he
is risen
from
the
dead
and
because of
this
the
miraculous powers
are working
in
him
-
For
Herod
having seized
-
John
he bound
and
in
prison
put [him]
on account of
Herodias
the
wife
of Philip
the
brother
of him
Had been saying
for
-
John
to him
Not
it is lawful
for you
to have
her
Although
wishing
him
to kill
he feared
the
multitude
because
as
a prophet
him
they were holding
[The] birthday
now
having been celebrated
-
of Herod
danced
the
daughter
-
of Herodias
in
the
midst
and
pleased
-
Herod
whereupon
with
oath
he promised
to her
to give
whatever
if
she should ask
-
And
having been urged on
by
the
mother
of her
Give
me
she says
here
upon
a platter
the
head
of John
the
Baptist
And
having been grieved
the
king
on account of
the
oaths
and
those
reclining with [him]
he commanded [it]
to be given
And
he having sent
beheaded
John
in
the
prison
And
was brought
the
head
of him
on
a platter
and
was given
to the
girl
and
she brought [it]
to
[the] mother
of her
And
having come
the
disciples
of him
took
the
body
and
buried
it
and
having come
they told
-
Jesus
Having heard
now
-
Jesus
withdrew
from there
by
boat
to
a secluded
place
apart
Himself
And
having heard [of it]
the
crowds
followed
Him
on foot
from
the
towns
And
having gone out
He saw
great
a crowd
and
was moved with compassion
toward
them
and
healed
the
sick
of them
Evening
now
having come
came
to Him
the
disciples
saying
Desolate
is
this
place
and
the
time
already
is gone by
Dismiss
therefore
the
crowds
that
having gone
into
the
villages
they might buy
for themselves
food
-
And
Jesus
said
to them
No
need
they have
to go away
Give
to them
you
to eat
-
And
they say
to Him
Not
we have
here
if
not
five
loaves
and
two
fish
-
And
He said
Bring
to Me
here
them
And
having commanded
the
crowds
to sit down
on
the
grass
having taken
the
five
loaves
and
the
two
fish
having looked up
to
-
heaven
He spoke a blessing
and
having broken
He gave
to the
disciples
the
loaves
-
and
the disciples
to the
crowds
And
ate
all
and
were satisfied
and
they took up
that
being over and above
of the
fragments
twelve
hand-baskets
full
Those
then
eating
were
men
about
five thousand
besides
women
and
children
And
immediately
He compelled
the
disciples
to enter
into
the
boat
and
to go before
Him
to
the
other side
until
that
He would have dismissed
the
crowds
And
having dismissed
the
crowds
He went up
on
the
mountain
by
Himself
to pray
Evening
now
having arrived
alone
He was
there
-
And
the boat
now
stadia
many
from
the
land
being
tossed
by
the
waves
was
for
contrary [was]
the
wind
In [the] fourth
now
watch
of the
night
He went
to
them
walking
on
the
sea
-
And
the disciples
having seen
Him
on
the
sea
walking
were troubled
saying
-
A ghost
it is
And
in
-
fear
they cried out
Immediately
now
spoke
-
Jesus
to them
saying
Take courage
I
it is
not
fear
Answering
now
to Him
-
Peter
said
Lord
if
You
[it] is
command
me
to come
to
You
upon
the
waters
-
And
He said
Come
And
having descended
from
the
boat
Peter
walked
upon
the
water
and
came
to
-
Jesus
Seeing
now
the
wind
he was afraid
and
having begun
to sink
he cried out
saying
Lord
save
me
Immediately
now
-
Jesus
having stretched out
the
hand
took hold
of him
and
says
to him
[You] of little faith
of
why
did you doubt
And
having entered
they
into
the
boat
ceased
the
wind
Those
then
in
the
boat
worshiped
Him
saying
Truly
of God
Son
You are
And
having crossed over
they came
to
the
land
of
Gennesaret
And
having recognized
Him
the
men
the
place
of that
sent
to
all
the
surrounding region
that
and
brought
to Him
all
those
sick
being
and
they were begging
Him
that
only
they might touch
the
fringe
of the
garment
of Him
and
as many as
touched
were cured
Then
come
-
to Jesus
from
Jerusalem
Pharisees
and
scribes
saying
Because of
why
the
disciples
of You
break
the
tradition
of the
elders
Not
for
they wash
the
hands
when
bread
they shall eat
-
And
answering
He said
to them
Because of
why
also
you
break
the
commandment
-
of God
on account of
the
tradition
of you
-
For
God
commanded
Honor
the
Father
and
the
mother
and
The [one]
speaking evil of
father
or
mother
in death
must end
You
however
say
Whoever
-
shall say
to the
father
or
the
mother
[It is] a gift
whatever
if
by
me
you might be profited
no
not
he shall honor
the
father
of himself
or
the
mother
of himself
And
you made void
the
commandment
-
of God
on account of
the
tradition
of you
Hypocrites
Rightly
prophesied
concerning
you
Isaiah
saying
The
people
this
with the
lips
Me
it honors
the
however
heart
of them
far away
is kept
from
Me
in vain
then
they worship
Me
teaching [as]
doctrines
[the] precepts
of men
And
having called to [Him]
the
crowd
He said
to them
Hear
and
understand
Not
what
is entering
into
the
mouth
defiles
the
man
but
that
going forth
out of
the
mouth
this
defiles
the
man
Then
having come near
the
disciples
said
to Him
Know You
that
the
Pharisees
having heard
the
saying
were offended
-
And
answering
He said
Every
plant
that
not
has planted
the
Father
of Me
-
Heavenly
it will be rooted up
Leave
them
Blind
they are
guides
of the blind
Blind
now
blind
if
they lead
both
into
a pit
will fall
Answering
then
-
Peter
said
to Him
Explain
to us
the
parable
-
And
He said
Still
also
you
without understanding
are
Not yet
understand you
that
everything
-
entering
into
the
mouth
into
the
stomach
goes
and
into
[the] sewer
is cast out
The things
however
going forth
out of
the
mouth
out of
the
heart
come forth
and these
defile
the
man
Out of
for
the
heart
come forth
thoughts
evil
murders
adulteries
sexual immorality
thefts
false testimonies
slanders
These
are
the things
defiling
the
man
-
but
with unwashed
hands
to eat
not
defiles
the
man
And
having gone forth
from there
-
Jesus
withdrew
to
the
district
of Tyre
and
Sidon
And
behold
a woman
Canaanite
from
the
region
same
having approached
was crying out
saying
Have mercy on
me
Lord
Son
of David
the
daughter
of me
miserably
is possessed by a demon
-
And
not
He answered
her
a word
And
having come to [him]
the
disciples
of Him
were imploring
Him
saying
Dismiss
her
for
she cries out
after
us
-
And
answering
He said
Not
I was sent
if
not
to
the
sheep
-
being lost
of [the] house
of Israel
-
And
having come
she was worshiping
Him
saying
Lord
help
me
-
And
answering
He said
Not
it is
right
to take
the
bread
of the
children
and
to cast [it]
to the
dogs
-
And
she said
Yes
Lord
even
however
the
dogs
eat
of
the
crumbs
-
falling
from
the
table
of the
masters
of them
Then
answering
-
Jesus
said
to her
O
woman
great [is]
of you
the
faith
Be it
to you
as
you desire
And
was healed
the
daughter
of her
from
the
hour
that
And
having departed
from there
-
Jesus
went
along
the
Sea
-
of Galilee
and
having gone up
on
the
mountain
He was sitting
there
And
came
to Him
crowds
great
having
with
them
lame
crippled
blind
mute
and
others
many
and
they placed
them
at
the
feet
of Him
and
He healed
them
so that
the
crowd
marveled
seeing
mute
speaking
crippled
restored
and
lame
walking
and
blind
seeing
and
they glorified
the
God
of Israel
-
And
Jesus
having called to [him]
the
disciples
of Him
said
I am moved with compassion
toward
the
crowd
because
already
days
three
they continue
with Me
and
nothing
have
that
they might eat
and
to send away
them
hungry
not
I am willing
not
lest
they faint
on
the
way
And
say
to Him
the
disciples
From where
to us
in
a secluded place
loaves
so many
as
to satisfy
a crowd
so great
And
says
to them
-
Jesus
How many
loaves
have you
-
And
they said
Seven
and
a few
small fish
And
He having commanded
the
crowds
to sit down
on
the
ground
having taken
the
seven
loaves
and
the
fish
and
having given thanks
He broke [them]
and
was giving
to
disciples
-
and the
disciples
to the
crowd
And
ate
all
and
were satisfied
and
that
being over and above
of the
fragments
they took up
seven
baskets
full
Those
then
eating
were
four thousand
men
besides
women
and
children
And
having dismissed
the
crowds
He entered
into
the
boat
and
came
to
the
region
of Magadan
And
having approached
the
Pharisees
and
Sadducees
testing
asked
Him
a sign
out of
-
heaven
to show
them
-
And
answering
He said
to them
Evening
having come
you say
Fair weather
is red
for
the
sky
And
in the morning
Today
a storm
is red
for
being overcast
the
sky
The
indeed
appearance
of the
sky
you know [how]
to discern
-
but
the signs
of the
times
not
you are able
A generation
evil
and
adulterous
a sign
seeks
and
a sign
not
will be given
to it
if
not
the
sign
of Jonah
And
having left
them
He went away
And
having come
the
disciples
to
the
other side
they forgot
bread
to take
-
And
Jesus
said
to them
Watch
and
beware
of
the
leaven
of the
Pharisees
and
Sadducees
-
And
they were reasoning
among
themselves
saying
Because
bread
not
we took
Having known [this]
however
-
Jesus
said
Why
reason you
among
yourselves
O [you] of little faith
because
bread
not
you took
Not yet
do you understand
nor
remember
the
five
loaves
for the
five thousand
and
how many
hand-baskets
you gathered
Nor
the
seven
loaves
for the
four thousand
and
how many
baskets
you gathered
How
not
understand you
that
not
concerning
bread
I spoke
to you
to beware
also
of
the
leaven
of the
Pharisees
and
Sadducees
Then
they understood
that
not
He said
to beware
of
the
leaven
of
bread
but
of
the
teaching
of the
Pharisees
and
Sadducees
Having come
then
-
Jesus
into
the
district
of Caesarea
-
Philippi
He was questioning
the
disciples
of Him
saying
Whom
do pronounce
-
men
to be
the
Son
of
man
-
And
they said
Some
indeed
John
the
Baptist
others
now
Elijah
others
now
Jeremiah
or
one
of the
prophets
He says
to them
You
but
whom
Me
do you pronounce
to be
Answering
now
Simon
Peter
said
You
are
the
Christ
the
Son
of
God
the
living
Answering
now
-
Jesus
said
to him
Blessed
are you
Simon
Barjona
For
flesh
and
blood
not
revealed [it]
to you
but
the
Father
of Me
who [is]
in
the
heavens
I also
now
to you
say
that
you
are
Peter
and
on
this
the
rock
I will build
My
-
church
and
[the] gates
of hades
not
will prevail against
it
I will give
to you
the
keys
of the
kingdom
of the
heavens
and
whatever
if
you might bind
on
the
earth
will be
bound
in
the
heavens
and
whatever
if
you might loose
on
the
earth
will be
loosed
in
the
heavens
Then
instructed He
the
disciples
that
to no one
they should say
that
He
is
the
Christ
From
that time
began
Jesus
Christ
to show
to the
disciples
of Him
that
it is necessary for
Him
to
Jerusalem
to go away
and
many things
to suffer
from
the
elders
and
chief priests
and
scribes
and
to be killed
and
on the
third
day
to be raised
And
having taken aside
Him
-
Peter
began
to rebuke
Him
saying
Far be it
from You
Lord
never
not
will be
to You
this
-
And
having turned
He said
-
to Peter
Get
behind
Me
Satan
A stumbling block
you are
to Me
For
not
your thoughts are of
the things
-
of God
but
the
things
of men
Then
-
Jesus
said
to
disciples
of Him
If
anyone
desires
after
Me
to come
let him deny
himself
and
take up
the
cross
of him
and
follow
Me
Whoever
for
if
might desire
the
life
of him
to save
will lose
it
whoever
however
-
might lose
the
life
of him
on account of
Me
will find
it
What
for
will it profit
a man
if
the
world
whole
he gains
-
but
the soul
of him
loses
Or
what
will give
a man
[as] an exchange for
the
soul
of him
Is about
for
the
Son
of the
man
to come
in
the
glory
the
Father
of Him
with
the
angels
of Him
and
then
He will give
to each
according to
the
deeds
of him
Truly
I say
to you
-
there are
some
of those
here
standing
who
no
not
shall taste
of death
until
-
they have seen
the
Son
-
of Man
coming
in
the
kingdom
of Him
And
after
days
six
takes with [Him]
-
Jesus
-
Peter
and
James
and
John
the
brother
of him
and
brings up
them
into
a mountain
high
by
themselves
And
He was transfigured
before
them
and
shone
the
face
of Him
like
the
sun
-
and
the clothes
of Him
became
white
as
the
light
And
behold
appeared
to them
Moses
and
Elijah
talking
with
Him
Answering
now
-
Peter
said
-
to Jesus
Lord
good
it is
for us
here
to be
If
You wish
I will make
here
three
tabernacles
for You
one
and
for Moses
one
and
for Elijah
one
While yet
he
was speaking
behold
a cloud
bright
overshadowed
them
and
behold
a voice
out of
the
cloud
saying
This
is
the
Son
of Me
the
beloved
in
whom
I am well pleased
Listen
to Him
And
having heard [it]
the
disciples
fell
upon
face
of them
and
were terrified
greatly
And
having come to [them]
-
Jesus
and
having touched
them
He said
Rise up
and
not
be afraid
Having lifted up
and
the
eyes
of them
no one
they saw
if
not
Himself
Jesus
alone
And
[as] were descending
they
from
the
mountain
instructed
them
-
Jesus
saying
To no one
tell
the
vision
until
that
the
Son
-
of Man
out from
[the] dead
is risen
And
asked
Him
the
disciples
saying
Why
then
the
scribes
say
that
Elijah
it behooves
to come
first
-
And
answering
He said
Elijah
indeed
comes
and
will restore
all things
I say
however
to you
that
Elijah
already
is come
and
not
they knew
him
but
did
to
him
whatever
they desired
Thus
also
the
Son
-
of Man
is about
to suffer
from
them
Then
understood
the
disciples
that
concerning
John
the
Baptist
He spoke
to them
And
they having come
to
the
crowd
came
to Him
a man
kneeling down to
Him
and
saying
Lord
have mercy on
my
-
son
for
he is epileptic
and
miserably
suffers
often
for
he falls
into
the
fire
and
often
into
the
water
And
I brought
him
to the
disciples
of You
and
not
they were able
him
to heal
Answering
now
-
Jesus
said
O
generation
unbelieving
and
perverted
how long
when
with
you
will I be
How long
when
will I bear with
you
Bring
to Me
him
here
And
rebuked
him
-
Jesus
and
went out
from
him
the
demon
and
was healed
the
boy
from
the
hour
that
Then
having come
the
disciples
-
to Jesus
in
private
they said
Because of
why
we
not
were able
to cast out
it
-
And
He said
to them
Because of
the
little faith
of you
Truly
for
I say
to you
If
you have
faith
as
a seed
of mustard
you will say
to the
mountain
to this
Move
from here
to there
and
it will move
And
nothing
will be impossible
for you
Were abiding
now
they
in
-
Galilee
said
to them
-
Jesus
Is about
the
Son
-
of Man
to be betrayed
into
[the] hands
of men
and
they will kill
Him
and
on the
third
day
He will be raised up
And
they were grieved
deeply
Having come
now
they
to
Capernaum
came
those
the
didrachmas
collecting
-
to Peter
and
said
The
Teacher
of you
not
does he pay
didrachmas
He says
Yes
And
he having entered
into
the
house
anticipated
him
-
Jesus
saying
What
you
do think
Simon
The
kings
of the
earth
from
whom
do they receive
custom
or
tribute
From
the
sons
of them
or
from
-
strangers
He having said
now
From
the
strangers
said
to him
-
Jesus
Then
free
are
the
sons
That
however
not
we might offend
them
having gone
to
sea
cast
a hook
and
the
having come up
first
fish
take
and
having opened
the
mouth
of it
you will find
a four-drachma coin
That
having taken
give
to them
for
Me
and
yourself
In
that
-
hour
came
the
disciples
-
to Jesus
saying
Who
then
[the] greatest
is
in
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
And
having called to [Him]
a child
He set
it
in
midst
of them
and
said
Truly
I say
to you
if
not
you turn
and
become
as
the
little children
no
not
shall you enter
into
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
Whoever
therefore
will humble
himself
as
the
little child
this
he
is
the
greatest
in
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
And
whoever
if
shall receive
one
little child
such
in
the
name
of Me
Me
receives
Whoever
then
-
shall cause to stumble
one
of the
little ones
of these
-
believing
in
Me
it is better
for him
that
should be hung
a millstone
heavy
around
the
neck
of him
and
he be sunk
in
the
depth
of the
sea
Woe
to the
world
because of
the
causes of sin
Necessary [are]
for
to come
the
stumbling blocks
but
woe
to the
man
by
whom
the
offense
comes
If
now
the
hand
of you
or
the
foot
of you
causes to sin
you
cut off
it
and
cast [it]
from
you
better
for you
it is
to enter
into
-
life
crippled
or
lame
than
two
hands
or
two
feet
having
to be cast
into
the
fire
-
eternal
And
if
the
eye
of you
causes to sin
you
gouge out
it
and
cast [it]
from
you
better
for you
it is
one-eyed
into
-
life
to enter
than
two
eyes
having
to be cast
into
the
hell
of the
fire
See [that]
not
you despise
one
of the
little ones
of these
I say
for
to you
that
the
angels
of them
in
[the] heavens
continually
always
behold
the
face
of the
Father
of me
who [is]
in
[the] heavens
What
you
do think
If
there should be
to any
man
a hundred
sheep
and
has gone astray
one
of
them
not
will he leave
the
ninety
nine
on
the
mountains
and
having gone
seek
the [one]
going astray
And
if
he should
find
it
truly
I say
to you
that
he rejoices
over
it
more
than
over
the
ninety
nine
-
not
having gone astray
Thus
not
it is
[the] will
of
the
Father
of you
who [is]
in
[the] heavens
that
should perish
one
of the
little ones
of these
If
now
sins
the
brother
of you
go
reprove
him
between
you
and
him
alone
If
you
he will hear
you have gained
the
brother
of you
If
however
not
he will hear
take
with
you
more
one
or
two
that
upon
[the] testimony
of two
witnesses
or
of three
may be strengthened
every
word
If
now
he fails to listen
to them
tell [it]
to the
church
If
now
also
to the
church
he fails to listen
let him be
to you
as
the
pagan
and
the
tax collector
Truly
I say
to you
how many
if
you shall bind
on
the
earth
shall have been
bound
in
heaven
and
how many
if
you shall loose
on
the
earth
shall have been
loosed
in
heaven
Again
truly
I say
to you
that
if
two
might agree
of
you
on
the
earth
concerning
any
matter
that
if
they shall ask
it will be done
for them
by
the
Father
of Me
who [is]
in
[the] heavens
Where
for
are
two
or
three
gathered together
unto
-
My
name
there
am I
in
[the] midst
of them
Then
having come
-
Peter
said
to Him
Lord
how often
will sin
against
me
the
brother
of me
and
I will forgive
him
Up to
seven times
Says
to him
-
Jesus
Not
I say
to you
up to
seven times
but
up to
seventy times
seven
Because of
this
has become like
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
to a man
a king
who
desired
to settle
accounts
with
the
servants
of him
Having begun
then
he
to settle
was brought
one
to him
a debtor
of ten thousand
talents
Nothing
having
now
he
to pay
commanded
him
the
master
to be sold
and
the
wife
and
the
children
and
all
as many as
he had
and
payment to be made
Having fallen down
therefore
the
servant
was bowing on his knees
to him
saying
Have patience
with
me
and
all
I will pay
to you
Having been moved with compassion
now
the
master
of the
servant
that
released
him
and
the
debt
forgave
him
Having gone out
however
the
servant
same
found
one
the
fellow servants
of him
who
was owing
him
a hundred
denarii
and
having seized
him
he was throttling [him]
saying
Pay
if
any
you owe
Having fallen down
therefore
the
fellow servant
of him
was begging
him
saying
Have patience
with
me
and
I will pay
you
-
But
not
he was willing
rather
having gone
he cast
him
into
prison
until
he should pay
that which
was owing
Having seen
therefore
the
fellow servants
of him
the things
having taken place
they were grieved
deeply
and
having gone
narrated
to
master
of themselves
all
that
having taken place
Then
having called to
him
the
master
of him
says
to him
Servant
evil
all
the
debt
that
I forgave
you
because
you begged
me
Not
did it behoove
also
you
to have pitied
the
fellow servant
of you
as
also I
you
had pitied
And
having been angry
the
master
of him
delivered
him
to the
jailers
until
that
he should pay
all
-
being owed
to him
Thus
also
the
Father
of Me
-
Heavenly
will do
to you
if
not
you forgive
each
the
brother
of him
from
the
heart
of you
And
it came to pass
when
had finished
-
Jesus
the
words
these
He withdrew
from
-
Galilee
and
came
to
the
region
-
of Judea
beyond
the
Jordan
And
followed
Him
crowds
great
and
He healed
them
there
And
came
to Him
Pharisees
testing
Him
and
saying
If
is it lawful
to divorce
the
a wife
to him
for
every
cause
Which
now
answering
He said
Not
have you read
that
the [One]
having created
from [the]
beginning
male
and
female
made
them
and
said
On account of
this
will leave
a man
the
father
and
the
mother
and
be joined with
the
wife
of him
and
will become
the
two
into
flesh
one
so that
no longer
are they
two
but
flesh
one
What
therefore
-
God
united together
man
not
let separate
They say
to Him
Why
then
Moses
did command
to give
a roll
of divorce
and
to send away
He says
to them
-
Moses
in view of
the
hardness of heart
of you
allowed
you
to divorce
the
wives
of you
from [the]
beginning
however
not
was [it]
this way
I say
now
to you
that
whoever
-
shall divorce
-
wife
of him
except
for
sexual immorality
and
shall marry
another
commits adultery
Say
to Him
the
disciples
If
this
is
the
case
of the
man
with
the
wife
not
it is better
to marry
-
And
He said
to them
Not
all
receive
the
word
this
but only [those]
to whom
it has been given
There are
for
eunuchs
who
from [the]
womb
of [their] mother
were born
thus
and
there are
eunuchs
who
were made eunuchs
by
-
men
and
there are
eunuchs
who
made eunuchs of
themselves
for the sake of
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
The [one]
being able
to receive [it]
let him receive [it]
Then
were brought
to Him
little children
that
the
hands
He might lay
on them
and
He might pray
-
however
the disciples
rebuked
them
-
And
Jesus
said
Permit
the
little children
and
not
do forbid
them
to come
to
Me
of the
for
such kind
is
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
And
having laid
the
hands
upon them
He departed
from there
And
behold
one
having come
to Him
said
Teacher
what
good [thing]
shall I do
that
I might have
life
eternal
-
And
He said
to him
Why
Me
ask you
about
what is
good
Only One
is
-
good
If
however
you desire
into
-
life
to enter
keep
the
commandments
He says
to him
Which
-
And
Jesus
said
-
Not
shall you murder
not
shall you commit adultery
not
shall you steal
not
shall you bear false witness
you shall honor
the
father
and
the
mother
and
you shall love
-
neighbor
of you
as
yourself
Says
to him
the
young man
Things
all these
I have kept
What
yet
lack I
Was saying
to him
-
Jesus
If
you desire
perfect
to be
go
sell
of you
the
possessing
and
give
poor
and
you will have
treasure
in
[the] heavens
and
come
follow
Me
Having heard
now
the
young man
the
statement
he went away
grieving
he was [one]
for
having
possessions
many
-
And
Jesus
said
to the
disciples
of Him
Truly
I say
to you
that
a rich man
with difficulty
will enter
into
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
Again
now
I say
to you
easier for
[it] is
a camel
through [the]
eye
of a needle
to go
than
a rich man
into
the
kingdom
of
God
Having heard
now
the
disciples
were astonished
exceedingly
saying
Who
then
is able
to be saved
Having looked on [them]
now
-
Jesus
said
to them
With
men
this
impossible
is
with
however
God
all things [are]
possible
Then
answering
-
Peter
said
to Him
Behold
we
left
all things
and
followed
You
what
then
will be
to us
-
And
Jesus
said
to them
Truly
I say
to you
that
you
-
having followed
Me
in
the
regeneration
when
shall sit down
the
Son
-
of Man
upon
[the] throne
of glory
of Him
will sit
also
you
on
twelve
thrones
judging
the
twelve
tribes
-
of Israel
And
everyone
who
has left
houses
or
brothers
or
sisters
or
father
or
mother
or
children
or
lands
for the sake of
-
My
name
a hundredfold
will receive
and
life
eternal
will inherit
Many
however
will be
first
last
and
last
first
Like
for
is
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
to a man
a master of a house
who
went out
in [the]
morning
to hire
workmen
for
the
vineyard
of him
Having agreed
then
with
the
workmen
for
a denarius
for the
day
he sent
them
into
the
vineyard
of him
And
having gone out
about
the third
hour
he saw
others
standing
in
the
marketplace
idle
and
to them
he said
Go
also
you
into
the
vineyard
and
whatever
if
might be
right
I will give
you
-
And
they went
Again
then
having gone out
about [the]
sixth
and
ninth
hour
he did
likewise
About
then
the
eleventh
having gone out
he found
others
standing
and
he says
to them
Why
here
stand you
all
the
day
idle
They say
to him
Because
no one
us
has hired
He says
to them
Go
also
You
into
the
vineyard
Evening
then
having arrived
says
the
master
of the
vineyard
to
foreman
of him
Call
the
workmen
and
pay
the
wages
having begun
from
the
last
unto
the
first
having come
And
those [hired]
about
the
eleventh
hour
they received
each
a denarius
And
having come
the
first
they thought
that
more
they will receive
but
they received
those
each
a denarius
also
themselves
Having received
now
they were grumbling
against
the
master of the house
saying
These
the
last
one
hour
have worked
and
equal
them
to us
you have made
those
having borne
the
burden
of the
day
and
the
scorching heat
-
And
answering
to one
of them
he said
Friend
not
I do wrong
you
Not
for a denarius
did you agree with
me
Take
what [is]
yours
and
go
I desire
now
to this
-
last
to give
as
also
to you
not
is it lawful
for me
what
I will
to do
with
that which [is]
mine
Or
the
eye
of you
envious
is
because
I
generous
am
Thus
will be
the
last
first
and
the
first
last

And
going up
Jesus
to
Jerusalem
He took
the
twelve
aside
themselves
and
on
the
way
He said
to them
Behold
we go up
to
Jerusalem
and
the
Son
-
of Man
will be betrayed
to the
chief priests
and
scribes
and
they will condemn
Him
to
death
and
they will betray
Him
the
Gentiles
unto
-
to mock
and
to flog
and
to crucify
and
the
third
day
He will rise again
Then
came
to Him
the
mother
of the
sons
of Zebedee
with
the
sons
of her
kneeling down
and
asking
something
from
Him
-
And
He said
to her
What
do you desire
She says
to Him
Say
that
might sit
these
-
two
sons
of mine
one
on
[the] right hand
and
one
on
[the] left hand
of You
in
the
kingdom
of You
Answering
now
-
Jesus
said
Not
you know
what
you ask for
Are you able
to drink
the
cup
which
I
am about
to drink
They say
to Him
We are able
He says
to them
-
Indeed
the cup
of Me
You will drink
-
but
to sit
on
[the] right hand
of Me
and
on
[the] left
not
is
Mine
this
to give
but [to those]
for whom
it has been prepared
by
the
Father
of Me
And
having heard [this]
the
ten
were indignant
about
the
two
brothers
-
And
Jesus
having called to [him]
them
said
You know
that
the
rulers
of the
Gentiles
exercise lordship over
them
and
the
great ones
exercise authority over
them
Not
thus
will it be
among
you
but
whoever
if
wishes
among
you
great
to become
he will be
your
servant
and
whoever
-
wishes
among
you
to be
first
he will be
your
slave
even as
the
Son
-
of Man
not
came
to be served
but
to serve
and
to give
the
life
of Him
[as] a ransom
for
many
And
[as] were going out
they
from
Jericho
followed
Him
a crowd
great
And
behold
two
blind [men]
sitting
beside
the
road
having heard
that
Jesus
is passing by
cried out
saying
Lord
Have mercy on
us
Son
of David
-
And
the crowd
rebuked
them
that
they should be silent
-
But
all the more
they cried out
saying
Lord
have mercy on
us
Son
of David
And
having stopped
-
Jesus
called
them
and
said
What
do you desire
I should do
unto you
They say
to Him
Lord
that
might be opened
the
eyes
of us
Having been moved with compassion
then
-
Jesus
touched
the
eyes
of them
and
immediately
they received sight
and
they followed
Him
And
when
they drew near
to
Jerusalem
and
came
to
Bethphage
on
the
Mount
-
of Olives
then
Jesus
sent
two
disciples
saying
to them
Go
into
the
village
-
in front
of you
and
immediately
you will find
a donkey
having been tied
and
a colt
with
her
having untied [them]
bring [them]
to Me
And
if
anyone
to you
says
anything
you will say
that
the
Lord
of them
need
has
Immediately
then
he will send
them
This
then
came to pass
that
it might be fulfilled
that
having been spoken
by
the
prophet
saying
Say
to the
daughter
of Zion
Behold
the
King
of you
comes
to you
gentle
and
mounted
on
a donkey
even
upon
a colt
[the] foal
of a beast of burden
Having gone
then
the
disciples
and
having done
as
commanded
them
-
Jesus
they brought
the
donkey
and
the
colt
and
put
upon
them
their
cloaks
and
He sat
on
them
The
now
very great
crowd
spread
their
the
cloaks
on
the
road
others
now
were cutting down
branches
from
the
trees
and
were spreading [them]
on
the
road
The
now
crowds
-
going before
Him
and
those
following
were crying out
saying
Hosanna
to the
Son
of David
Blessed is
the [One]
coming
in
[the] name
of [the] Lord
Hosanna
in
the
highest
And
having entered
of Him
into
Jerusalem
was stirred
all
the
city
saying
Who
is
this
-
And
the crowds
were saying
This
is
the
prophet
Jesus
the [One]
from
Nazareth
-
of Galilee
And
entered
Jesus
into
the
temple
and
cast out
all
those
selling
and
buying
in
the
temple
and
the
tables
of the
money changers
He overturned
and
the
seats
of those
selling
the
doves
And
He says
to them
It has been written
The
house
of Me
a house
of prayer
will be called
You
however
it
have made
a den
of robbers
And
came
to Him
blind
and
lame
in
the
temple
and
He healed
them
Having seen
now
the
chief priests
and
the
scribes
the
wonders
that
He did
and
the
children
the
crying out
in
the
temple
and
saying
Hosanna
to the
Son
of David
they were indignant
and
said
to Him
Hear you
what
these
say
-
And
Jesus
says
to them
Yes
never
did you read
-
Out of [the]
mouth
of babes
and
sucklings
You have prepared for yourself
praise
And
having left
them
He went
out of
the
city
to
Bethany
and
He passed the night
there
In the morning
then
having come back
into
the
city
He became hungry
And
having seen
fig tree
one
along
the
road
He came
to
it
and
nothing
found
on
it
if
not
leaves
only
And
He says
to it
Never
no more
from
you
fruit
let there be
to
the
age
And
withered
immediately
the
fig tree
And
having seen [it]
the
disciples
marveled
saying
How
so quickly
withered
the
fig tree
Answering
now
-
Jesus
said
to them
Truly
I say
to you
if
you have
faith
and
not
do doubt
not
only
the [miracle]
of the
fig tree
will you do
but
even if
to the
mountain
this
you should say
Be you taken away
and
be you cast
into
the
sea
it will come to pass
And
all things
as many as
-
you might ask
in
-
prayer
believing
you will receive
And
having come
of Him
into
the
temple
came
to Him
teaching
the
chief priests
and
the
elders
of the
people
saying
By
what
authority
these things
are You doing
And
who
to You
gave
the
authority
this
Answering
now
-
Jesus
said
to them
Will ask
you
I also
thing
one
which
if
you tell
Me
I also
to you
will say
by
what
authority
these things
I do
The
baptism
of
John
from where
was it
From
heaven
or
from
men
-
And
they were reasoning
with
themselves
saying
If
we should say
From
heaven
He will say
to us
Because of
why
then
not
did you believe
him
If
however
we should say
From
men
we fear
the
multitude
all
for
as
a prophet
hold
-
John
And
answering
-
Jesus
they said
Not
do we know
Said
to them
also
He
Neither
I
tell
you
by
what
authority
these things
I do
What
however
you
think
A man
had
sons
two
having come
to the
first
he said
Son
go
today
work
in
the
vineyard
-
And
answering
he said
will I
master
however
Not
he went
Having come
then
to the
second
he said
likewise
-
And
answering
he said
I [will]
sir
and
not
did he go
Which
of
the
two
did
the
will
of the
father
They say
The
first
Says
to them
-
Jesus
Truly
I say
to you
that
the
tax collectors
and
the
prostitutes
go before
you
into
the
kingdom
-
of God
Came
for
John
to
you
in [the]
way
of righteousness
and
not
you did believe
him
-
however
the tax collectors
and
the
prostitutes
believed
him
you
then
having seen
not even
did repent
afterward
-
to believe
him
Another
parable
hear
A man
there was
a master of a house
who
planted
a vineyard
and
a fence
it
placed around
and
dug
in
it
a winepress
and
built
a tower
and
rented out
it
to farmers
and
traveled abroad
When
then
drew near
the
season
of the
fruits
he sent
the
servants
of him
to
the
farmers
to receive
the
fruits
of him
And
having taken
the
farmers
the
servants
of him
one
-
they beat
one
then
they killed
one
then
they stoned
Again
he sent
other
servants
more
than the
first
and
they did
to them
likewise
Afterward
then
he sent
to
them
the
son
of him
saying
They will respect
the
son
of me
-
But
the farmers
having seen
the
son
said
among
themselves
This
is
the
heir
come
let us kill
him
and
gain possession of
the
inheritance
of him
And
having taking
him
they cast [him]
out of
the
vineyard
and
killed [him]
When
therefore
shall come
the
master
of the
vineyard
what
will he do
the
farmers
to those
They say
to him
[The] wretches
grievously
He will destroy
them
and
the
vineyard
he will rent out
to other
farmers
who
will give
to him
the
fruits
in
the
seasons
of them
Says
to them
-
Jesus
Never
did you read
in
the
Scriptures
[The] stone
which
rejected
those
building
this
has become
the
chief
corner
From
[the] Lord
was
this
and
it is
marvelous
in
[the] eyes
of us
Because of
this
I say
to you
that
will be taken away
from
you
the
kingdom
-
of God
and
it will be given
to a people
producing
the
fruits
of it
And
the [one]
having fallen
on
the
stone
this
will be broken
on
whomever
but
-
it shall fall
it will grind to powder
him
And
having heard
the
chief priests
and
the
Pharisees
the
parables
of Him
they knew
that
about
them
He speaks
And
seeking
Him
to lay hold of
they feared
the
crowds
because
as
a prophet
Him
they were holding
And
answering
-
Jesus
again
spoke
in
parables
to them
saying
Has become like
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
to a man
a king
who
made
a wedding feast
for the
son
of him
And
he sent
the
servants
of him
to call
those
having been invited
to
the
wedding feast
and
not
they were willing
to come
Again
he sent
other
servants
saying
Say
to those
having been invited
Behold
the
dinner
of me
I have prepared
the
oxen
of Me
and
the
fatlings
have been killed
and
all things [are]
ready
come
to
the
wedding feast
-
And
having paid no attention
they went away
one
-
to
the
own
field
one
then
to
the
business
of him
-
And
the rest
having laid hold of
the
servants
of him
mistreated
and
killed [them]
-
And
the king
was angry
and
having sent
the
armies
of him
he destroyed
the
murderers
those
and
the
city
of them
he burned
Then
he says
to
servants
of him
The
indeed
wedding feast
ready
is
those
however
having been invited
not
were
worthy
Go
therefore
into
the
thoroughfares
of the
highways
and
as many as
if
you shall find
invite
to
the
wedding feast
And
having gone out
the
servants
those
into
the
highways
they brought together
all
as many as
they found
evil
both
and
good
and
became full
the
wedding hall
of those reclining
Having entered in
then
the
king
to see
those
reclining
he beheld
there
a man
not
being dressed
in clothes
of wedding
and
he says
to him
Friend
how
did you enter
here
not
having
garment
of wedding
-
And
he was speechless
Then
the
king
said
to the
servants
Having bound
his
feet
and
hands
cast out
him
into
the
darkness
-
outer
there
will be
the
weeping
and
the
gnashing
of the
teeth
Many
for
are
called
few
however
chosen
Then
having gone out
the
Pharisees
counsel
took
how
Him
they might trap
in
His words
And
they send
to Him
the
disciples
of them
with
the
Herodians
saying
Teacher
we know
that
true
You are
and
the
way
-
of God
in
[the] truth
You teach
and
not
there is care
to You
about
no one
not
for
You look
on [the]
appearance
of men
Tell
therefore
us
what
You
think
Is it lawful
to give
tribute
to Caesar
or
not
Having known
however
-
Jesus
the
malice
of them
He said
Why
Me
do you test
hypocrites
Show
Me
the
coin
of the
tribute
-
And
they presented
to Him
a denarius
And
He says
to them
Whose [is]
the
likeness
this
And
whose
inscription
They say
Caesarâs
Then
He says
to them
Give back
therefore
the things
of Caesar
to Caesar
and
the things
-
of God
-
to God
And
having heard
they marveled
and
having left
Him
they went away
On
that
-
day
came
to Him
Sadducees
those saying
not
there is
a resurrection
and
they questioned
Him
saying
Teacher
Moses
said
If
anyone
should die
not
having
children
will marry
the
brother
of him
the
wife
of him
and
he will raise up
offspring
for the
brother
of him
There were
now
among
us
seven
brothers
and
the
first
having married
died
and
not
having
seed
he left
the
wife
of him
to the
brother
of him
Likewise
also
the
second
and
the
third
unto
the
seventh
Last
then
of all
died
the
woman
In
the
resurrection
therefore
of which
of the
seven
will she be
wife
All
for
had
her
Answering
now
-
Jesus
said
to them
You err
not
knowing
the
Scriptures
nor
the
power
-
of God
In
for
the
resurrection
neither
do they marry
nor
are given in marriage
but
like
angels
in
-
heaven
they are
Concerning
now
the
resurrection
of the
dead
not
have you read
that which
has been spoken
to you
by
-
God
saying
I
am
the
God
of Abraham
and
the
God
of Isaac
and
the
God
of Jacob
Not
He is
the
God
of [the] dead
but
of [the] living
And
having heard
the
crowds
were astonished
at
the
teaching
of Him
-
And
the Pharisees
having heard
that
He had silenced
the
Sadducees
were gathered
together
the
same
And
questioned [Him]
one
of
them
a lawyer
testing
Him
Teacher
which
commandment
[is the] greatest
in
the
law
-
And
He said
to him
You shall love
[the] Lord
the
God
of you
with
all
the
heart
of you
and
with
all
the
soul
of you
and
with
all
the
mind
of you
This
is
the
great
and
first
commandment
[The] second
[is] like
it
You shall love
the
neighbor
of you
as
yourself
On
these
-
two
commandments
all
the
law
hangs
and
the
Prophets
Having been assembled together
now
the
Pharisees
questioned
them
-
Jesus
saying
What
you
think
concerning
the
Christ
Of whom
son
is He
They say
to Him
-
Of David
He says
to them
How
then
David
in
spirit
does call
Him
Lord
saying
Said
the Lord
to the
Lord
of me
Sit
on
[the] right hand
of Me
until
-
I place
the
enemies
of You
[as] a footstool
for the
feet
of You
If
therefore
David
calls
Him
Lord
how
son
of him
is He
And
no one
was able
to answer
Him
a word
nor
dared
anyone
from
that
-
day
to question
Him
no longer
Then
-
Jesus
spoke
to the
crowds
and
to
disciples
of Him
saying
On
-
Mosesâ
seat
have sat down
the
scribes
and
the
Pharisees
All things
therefore
how many
if
they might tell
you
keep
and
observe
After
however
the
works
of them
not
do
They speak
for
and
not
act
They tie up
-
burdens
heavy
and
lay [them]
on
the
shoulders
-
of men
themselves
however
with
finger
of them
not
are they willing
to move
them
All
now
the
deeds
of them
they do
in order
-
to be seen
-
by men
They broaden
for
the
phylacteries
of them
and
enlarge
their
tassels
They love
now
the
chief place
at
the
banquets
and
the
first seats
in
the
synagogues
and
the
greetings
in
the
marketplaces
and
to be called
by
-
men
Rabbi
You
however
not
shall be called
Rabbi
One
for
is
of you
the
Teacher
all
now
you
brothers
are
And
father
no [one]
call
of you
on
the
earth
One
for
is
of you
the
Father
who [is]
in heaven
Neither
be called
instructors
since
[the] instructor
of you
is
One
the
Christ
-
And
the greatest
among you
will be
your
servant
He who
then
shall exalt
himself
will be humbled
and
whoever
shall humble
himself
will be exalted
Woe
however
to you
scribes
and
Pharisees
hypocrites
For
you shut up
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
before
-
men
You
for
neither
enter
nor even
those who
are entering
do you allow
to go in
Woe
to you
scribes
and
Pharisees
hypocrites
For
you traverse
the
sea
and
the
dry [land]
to make
one
convert
and
when
he has become [so]
you make
him
a son
of hell
twofold more
than yourselves
Woe
to you
guides
blind
those
saying
Whoever
-
shall swear
by
the
temple
nothing
it is
whoever
however
-
shall swear
by
the
gold
of the
temple
is bound by his oath
Foolish
and
blind
Which
for
greater
is
the
gold
or
the
temple
-
having sanctified
the
gold
And [you say]
Whoever
-
shall swear
by
the
altar
nothing
it is
whoever
however
-
shall swear
by
the
gift
that [is]
upon
it
he is bound by his oath
You blind men
Which
for
[is] greater
the
gift
or
the
altar
-
sanctifying
the
gift
The [one]
therefore
having sworn
by
the
altar
swears
by
it
and
by
all things
that [are]
upon
it
And
the [one]
having sworn
by
the
temple
swears
by
it
and
by
the [One]
dwelling
in it
And
the [one]
having sworn
by
-
heaven
swears
by
the
throne
-
of God
and
by
the [One]
sitting
upon
it
Woe
to you
scribes
and
Pharisees
hypocrites
For
you pay tithes of
-
mint
and
-
dill
and
-
cummin
and
you have neglected
the
weightier [matters]
of the
law
-
justice
and
-
mercy
and
-
faithfulness
These
now
it behooved you
to do
those
not
to be leaving aside
Guides
blind
Those
straining out
the
gnat
the
however
camel
swallowing
Woe
to you
scribes
and
Pharisees
hypocrites
For
you cleanse
the
outside
of the
cup
and
of the
dish
inside
however
they are full
of
greed
and
self-indulgence
Pharisee
blind
Cleanse
first
the
inside
of the
cup
that
might become
also
the
outside
of them
clean
Woe
to you
scribes
and
Pharisees
hypocrites
For
you are like
tombs
having been whitewashed
which
outwardly
indeed
appear
beautiful
Inside
however
they are full
of bones
of [the] dead
and
of all
impurity
Thus
also
you
outwardly
indeed
appear
-
to men
righteous
inwardly
however
you are
full
of hypocrisy
and
lawlessness
Woe
to you
scribes
and
Pharisees
hypocrites
For
you build
the
tombs
of the
prophets
and
adorn
the
monuments
of the
righteous
and
you say
If
we had lived
in
the
days
of the
fathers
of us
not
-
we would have been
with them
partakers
in
the
blood
of the
prophets
Thus
you bear witness
to yourselves
that
sons
you are
of those
having murdered
the
prophets
And
you
fill up
the
measure
of the
fathers
of you
Serpents
Offspring
of vipers
How
shall you escape
from
the
sentence
-
of hell
Because of
this
behold
I
send
to
you
prophets
and
wise [men]
and
scribes
Some of
them
you will kill
and
will crucify
and [some]
of
them
you will flog
in
the
synagogues
of you
and
will persecute
from
town
to
town
so that
shall come
upon
you
all [the]
blood
righteous
being poured out
upon
the
earth
from
the
blood
of Abel
the
righteous
to
the
blood
of Zechariah
son
of Berekiah
whom
you murdered
between
the
temple
and
the
altar
Truly
I say
to you
will come
these things
all
upon
the
generation
this
Jerusalem
Jerusalem
-
killing
the
prophets
and
stoning
those
having been sent
to
her
How often
would I
have gathered together
the
children
of you
in which
way
a hen
gathers together
the
chicks
of her
under
the
wings
and
not
you were willing
Behold
is left
to you
the
house
of you
I say
for
to you
no
not
Me
shall you see
from
now
until
-
you say
Blessed [is]
the [One]
coming
in [the]
name
of [the] Lord
And
having gone forth
-
Jesus
from
the
temple
He was going away
and
came to [Him]
the
disciples
of Him
to point out
to Him
the
buildings
of the
temple
-
And
answering
He said
to them
Not
do you see
these things
all
Truly
I say
to you
none
not even
shall be left
here
stone
upon
stone
which
not
will be thrown down
[As] was sitting
now
He
upon
the
Mount
-
of Olives
came to
Him
the
disciples
in
private
saying
Tell
us
when
these things
will be
And
what [is]
the
sign
-
of Your
coming
and
of the consummation
of the
age
And
answering
-
Jesus
said
to them
Take heed
lest
anyone
you
mislead
Many
for
will come
in
the
name
of Me
saying
I
am
the
Christ
and
many
they will mislead
You will begin
then
to hear of
wars
and
rumors
of wars
Behold
not
be alarmed
it is necessary
for
to take place
but
not yet
is
the
end
Will rise up
for
nation
against
nation
and
kingdom
against
kingdom
and
there will be
famines
and
earthquakes
in
[various] places
All
then
these [are]
[the] beginning
of birth pains
Then
will they deliver
you
to
tribulation
and
will kill
you
and
you will be
hated
by
all
the
nations
on account of
the
name
of Me
And
then
will fall away
many
and
one another
they will betray
and
will hate
one another
and
many
false prophets
will arise
and
will mislead
many
And
because
-
is to be multiplied
-
lawlessness
will grow cold
the
love
of the
many
The [one]
however
having endured
to [the]
end
he
will be saved
And
there will be proclaimed
this
-
gospel
of the
kingdom
in
all
the
earth
for
a testimony
to all
the
nations
and
then
will come
the
end
When
therefore
you shall see
the
abomination
-
of desolation
-
having been spoken of
by
Daniel
the
prophet
standing
in [the]
place
holy
the [one]
reading
let him understand
then
those
in
-
Judea
let them flee
to
the
mountains
the [one]
on
the
housetop
not
let him come down
to take
anything
out of
the
house
of him
and
the [one]
in
the
field
neither
let him return
back
to take
the
cloak
of him
Woe
then
to those
in
womb
having
and
to the [ones]
nursing infants
in
those
the
days
Pray
however
that
not
might be
the
flight
of you
in winter
nor
on a Sabbath
There will be
for
then
tribulation
great
such as
not
has been
from [the]
beginning
of [the] world
until
-
now
no
never
not
shall be
And
if
not
had been shortened
the
days
those
not
-
there would have been saved
any
flesh
because of
however
the
elect
will be shortened
the
days
those
Then
if
anyone
to you
says
Behold
here [is]
the
Christ
or
Here
not
believe [it]
There will arise
for
false Christs
and
false prophets
and
they will give
signs
great
and
wonders
so as
to mislead
if
possible
even
the
elect
Behold
I have foretold [it]
to you
If
therefore
they say
to you
Behold
in
the
wilderness
He is
not
go forth
[or] âBehold
in
the
inner rooms
not
believe [it]
Just as
for
the
lightning
comes forth
from [the]
east
and
shines
as far as [the]
west
so
will be
the
coming
of the
Son
-
of Man
For wherever
if
may be
the
carcass
there
will be gathered
the
vultures
Immediately
then
after
the
tribulation
the
days
of those
The
sun
will be darkened
and
the
moon
not
will give
the
light
of it
and
the
stars
will fall
from
the
sky
and
the
powers
of the
heavens
will be shaken
And
then
will appear
the
sign
of the
Son
-
of Man
in
heaven
and
then
will mourn
all
the
tribes
of the
earth
and
they will see
the
Son
-
of Man
coming
on
the
clouds
-
of heaven
with
power
and
glory
great
And
He will send
the
angels
of Him
with
a trumpet call
great
and
they will gather together
the
elect
of Him
from
the
four
winds
from
[the] ends
of the heavens
to
ends
of them
Of
now
the
fig tree
learn
the
parable
When
already
the
branch
of it
may have become
tender
and
the
leaves
it puts forth
you know
that
near [is]
the
summer
Thus
also
you
when
you see
all
these things
know
that
near
He is
at
[the] doors
Truly
I say
to you
that
no
not
will have passed away
the
generation
this
until
-
all
these things
shall have taken place
The
heaven
and
the
earth
will pass away
-
but
the words
of Me
no
not
shall pass away
Concerning
however
the
day
that
and
hour
no one
knows
not even
the
angels
of the
heavens
nor
the
Son
if
not
the
Father
only
As [were]
for
the
days
-
of Noah
so
will be
the
coming
of the
Son
-
of Man
As
for
they were
in
the
days
those
-
before
the
flood
eating
and
drinking
marrying
and
giving in marriage
until
that
day
entered
Noah
into
the
ark
And
not
they knew
until
came
the
flood
and
took away
all
thus
will be
also
the
coming
of the
Son
-
of Man
Then
will be
two
in
the
field
one
is taken
and
one
is left
Two [women]
will be grinding
at
the
mill
one
is taken
and
one
is left
Keep watch
therefore
for
not
you know
on what
day
the
Lord
of you
comes
This
then
know
that
if
had known
the
master of the house
in what
time of night
the
thief
comes
he would have watched
-
and
not
-
have allowed
to be broken into
the
house
of him
Because of
this
also
you
be
ready
for
in that
not
you expect
hour
the
Son
-
of Man
comes
Who
then
is
the
faithful
servant
and
wise
whom
has set
the
master
over
the
household
of him
-
to give
to them
the
food
in
season
Blessed [is]
the
servant
that
whom
having come
the
master
of him
will find
thus
doing
Truly
I say
to you
that
over
all
the
possessing
of him
he will set
him
If
however
should say
the
evil
servant
that
in
the
heart
of him
Delays
of Me
the
master
and
should begin
to beat
the
fellow servants
of him
to eat
then
and
to drink
with
those
being drunkards
will come
the
master
the
servant
of that
in
a day
in which
not
he does expect
and
in
an hour
which
not
he is aware
and
will cut in pieces
him
and
the
place
of him
with
the
hypocrites
will appoint
there
will be
the
weeping
and
the
gnashing
of
teeth
Then
will be likened
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
to ten
virgins
who
having taken
the
lamps
of them
went forth
to
meet
the
bridegroom
Five
now
of
them
were
foolish
and
five
wise
The
for
foolish
having taken
the
lamps
not
did take
with
them
oil
-
but
the wise
took
oil
in
the
vessels
with
the
lamps
of them
Tarrying
then
the
bridegroom
they became drowsy
all
and
were sleeping
At middle
then
of [the] night
a cry
there was
Behold
the
bridegroom
Go forth
to
meet
Then
arose
all
the
virgins
those
and
trimmed
the
lamps
of them
-
And
the foolish
to the
wise
said
Give
us
of
the
oil
of you
for
the
lamps
of us
are going out
Answered
then
the
wise
saying
Lest
-
no
not even
it might suffice
for us
and
you
Go
rather
to
those
selling
and
buy
for yourselves
[While] are going away
then
they
to buy
came
the
bridegroom
and
those
ready
went in
with
him
to
the
wedding feast
and
was shut
the
door
Afterward
then
come
also
the
other
virgins
saying
Lord
Lord
open
to us
-
And
answering
he said
Truly
I say
to you
not
I do know
you
Watch
therefore
for
neither
do you know
the
day
nor
the
hour
[It is] like
for
a man
going on a journey
[who] called
the
own
servants
and
delivered
to them
the
possessing
of him
And
to one
indeed
he gave
five
talents
to one
then
two
to one
then
one
to each
according to
the
own
ability
and
he left the region
immediately
Having gone
the [one]
the
five
talents
having received
traded
with
them
and
made
more
five
Likewise
the [one with]
the
two
gained
more
two
The [one]
however
-
one
having received
having gone away
dug in
the ground
and
hid
the
money
of the
master
of him
After
then
much
time
comes
the
master
of the
servants
those
and
takes
account
with
them
And
having come
the [one]
the
five
talents
having received
brought to [him]
other
five
talents
saying
Master
five
talents
to me
you did deliver
Behold
more
five
talents
have I gained
Said
to him
the
master
of Him
Well done
servant
good
and
faithful
Over
a few things
you were
faithful
over
many things
you
will I set
Enter
into
the
joy
of the
master
of you
Having come
also
the [one]
with the
two
talents
he said
Master
two
talents
to me
you did deliver
Behold
more
two
talents
have I gained
Said
to him
the
master
of Him
Well done
servant
good
and
faithful
Over
a few things
you were
faithful
over
many things
you
will I set
Enter
into
the
joy
of the
master
of you
Having come
then
also
the [one]
the
one
talent
having received
he said
Master
I knew
you
that
hard
you are
a man
reaping
where
not
you did sow
and
gathering
from where
not
you did scatter
And
having been afraid
having gone away
I hid
the
talent
of you
in
the
ground
Behold
you have
what [is]
yours
Answering
now
the
master
of him
said
to him
Wicked
servant
and
lazy
You knew
that
I reap
where
not
I sowed
and
gather
from where
not
I scattered
It behooved
you
therefore
to put
the
money
of me
to the
bankers
and
having come
I
would have received
-
-
my own
with
interest
Take
therefore
from
him
the
talent
and
give [it]
to the [one]
having
the
ten
talents
-
For
having
to everyone
will be given
and
he will have in abundance
the [one]
however
not
having
even
that which
he has
will be taken away
from
him
And
the
worthless
servant
cast out
into
the
darkness
-
outer
there
will be
the
weeping
and
the
gnashing
of the
teeth
When
then
comes
the
Son
-
of Man
in
the
glory
of Him
and
all
the
angels
with
Him
then
He will sit
upon [the]
throne
of glory
of Him
And
will be gathered
before
Him
all
the
nations
and
He will separate
them
from
one another
as
the
shepherd
separates
the
sheep
from
the
goats
And
He will set
-
indeed
the sheep
on
[the] right hand
of Him
-
and
the goats
on
[the] left
Then
will say
the
King
to those
on
[the] right hand
of Him
Come
those
being blessed
of the
Father
of me
inherit
the
having been prepared
for you
kingdom
from [the]
foundation
of [the] world
I hungered
for
and
you gave
Me
to eat
I thirsted
and
you gave to drink
me
a stranger
I was
and
you took in
Me
naked
and
you clothed
Me
I was sick
and
you visited
Me
in
prison
I was
and
you came
to
Me
Then
will answer
Him
the
righteous
saying
Lord
when
You
saw we
hungering
and
fed [You]
Or
thirsting
and
gave [You] to drink
When
now
You
saw we
a stranger
and
took [You] in
Or
naked
and
clothed [You]
When
now
You
saw we
ailing
or
in
prison
and
came
to
You
And
answering
the
King
will say
to them
Truly
I say
to you
to the extent
as much as
you did [it]
to one
of these
the
brothers
of Me
the
least
to Me
you did [it]
Then
will He say
also
to those
on
[the] left
Depart
from
Me
being cursed
into
the
fire
-
eternal
-
having been prepared
for the
devil
and
the
angels
of him
I hungered
for
and
nothing
you gave
to Me
to eat
I thirsted
and
nothing
You gave to drink
Me
a stranger
I was
and
not
You took in
Me
naked
and
not
you did clothe
Me
sick
and
in
prison
and
not
did you visit
Me
Then
will answer
also
themselves
saying
Lord
when
You
saw we
hungering
or
thirsting
or
a stranger
or
naked
or
sick
or
in
prison
and
not
did minister
to You
Then
will He answer
them
saying
Truly
I say
to you
to the extent
that
not
you did [it]
to one
of these
the
least
neither
to Me
did you
And
will go away
these
into
punishment
eternal
-
but
the righteous
into
life
eternal
And
it came to pass
when
had finished
-
Jesus
all
the
words
these
He said
to the
disciples
of Him
You know
that
after
two
days
the
Passover
takes place
and
the
Son
-
of Man
is delivered
over
-
to be crucified
Then
were gathered together
the
chief priests
and
the
elders
of the
people
in
the
courtyard
of the
high priest
who
is called
Caiaphas
and
they plotted together
in order that
-
Jesus
by guile
they might seize
and
kill
They were saying
however
Not
during
the
feast
that
not
a riot
there be
among
the
people
-
And
of Jesus
having been
in
Bethany
in [the]
house
of Simon
the
leper
came
to Him
a woman
having
an alabaster flask
fragrant oil
very costly
and
poured [it]
on
the
head
of Him
[as] He is reclining
Having seen
then
the
disciples
became indignant
saying
For what
purpose
[is] the
waste
this
Could
for
this
have been sold
for much
and
have been given
to [the] poor
Having known [this]
now
-
Jesus
said
to them
Why
trouble
do you cause
to the
woman
A work
for
beautiful
she did
to
Me
Always
for
the
poor
you have
with
you
Me
however
not
always
you have
In pouring
for
this [woman]
the
fragrant oil
this
on
the
body
of Me
for
the
burial
of Me
she did [it]
Truly
I say
to you
wherever
if
shall be proclaimed
the
gospel
this
in
all
the
world
will be spoken of
also
that which
did
this [woman]
for
a memorial
of her
Then
having gone
one
of the
Twelve
the [one]
being called
Judas
Iscariot
to
the
chief priests
he said
What
are you willing
me
to give
and I
to you
will betray
Him
-
And
they appointed
to him
thirty
pieces of silver
And
from
that time
he was seeking
an opportunity
that
Him
he might betray
On the
now
first [day]
of the
unleavened [bread]
came
the
disciples
-
to Jesus
saying
Where
wish you [that]
we should prepare
for You
to eat
the
Passover
-
And
He said
Go
into
the
city
unto
a
certain man
and
tell
him
the
Teacher
says
The
time
of Me
near
is
with
you
I will keep
the
Passover
with
the
disciples
of Me
And
did
the
disciples
as
directed
them
-
Jesus
and
prepared
the
Passover
Evening
now
having arrived
He was reclining
with
the
twelve
disciples
And [as]
they were eating
to them
He said
Truly
I say
to you
that
one
of
you
will betray
Me
And
being grieved
exceedingly
they began
to say
to Him
one
each
Not
I
is it
Lord
-
And
answering
He said
The [one]
having dipped
with
Me
the
hand
in
the
dish
he
Me
will betray
-
Indeed
the Son
-
of Man
goes
as
it has been written
about
Him
woe
however
-
the man
to that
by
whom
the
Son
-
of Man
is betrayed
Better
would it be
for him
if
not
had been born
the
man
that
Answering
now
Judas
who
was betraying
Him
said
Not
I
is it
Rabbi
He says
to him
You
have said
[As] they were eating
now
of them
having taken
-
Jesus
bread
and
having blessed
broke [it]
and
having given
to the
disciples
He said
Take
eat
this
is
the
body
of Me
And
having taken
a cup
and
having given thanks
He gave [it]
to them
saying
Drink
of
it
all of you
This
for
is
the
blood
of Me
of the
covenant
-
for
many
being poured out
for
forgiveness
of sins
I say
now
to you
no
not
will I drink
from
now
of
this
the
fruit
of the
vine
until
the
day
that
when
it
I drink
with
you
anew
in
the
kingdom
of the
Father
of Me
And
having sung a hymn
they went out
to
the
Mount
-
of Olives
Then
says
to them
-
Jesus
All
you
will fall away
because of
Me
during
the
night
this
It has been written
for
I will strike
the
shepherd
and
will be scattered
the
sheep
of the
flock
After
however
-
being raised
I
will go before
you
into
-
Galilee
Answering
now
-
Peter
said
to Him
If
all
will fall away
because of
You
I
never
will fall away
Said
to him
-
Jesus
Truly
I say
to you
that
during
this
-
night
before [the]
rooster
crowing
three times
you will deny
Me
Says
to Him
-
Peter
Even if
it were necessary for
me
with
You
to die
no
not
You
will I deny
Likewise
also
all
the
disciples
said
Then
comes
with
them
-
Jesus
to
a place
called
Gethsemane
and
He says
to the
disciples
Sit
here
until
that
having gone away
over there
I shall pray
And
having taken with [Him]
-
Peter
and
the
two
sons
of Zebedee
He began
to be sorrowful
and
deeply distressed
Then
He says
to them
Very sorrowful
is
the
soul
of Me
even to
death
remain
here
and
watch
with
Me
And
having gone forward
a little
He fell
upon
face
of Him
praying
and
saying
Father
of Me
if
possible
it is
let pass
from
Me
the
cup
this
Nevertheless
not
as
I
will
but
as
You
And
He comes
to
the
disciples
and
finds
them
sleeping
And
He says
-
to Peter
Thus
not
were you able
one
hour
to watch
with
Me
Watch
and
pray
that
not
you enter
into
temptation
The
indeed
spirit
[is] willing
-
but
the flesh
weak
Again
for
a second time
having gone away
He prayed
saying
Father
of Me
if
not
is possible
this
to pass
if
not
it
I drink
be done
the
will
of You
And
having come
again
He finds
them
sleeping
were
for
of them
the
eyes
heavy
And
having left
them
again
having gone away
He prayed
for
[the] third time
the
same
thing
having said
again
Then
He comes
to
the
disciples
and
says
to them
Sleep
later on
and
take your rest
Behold
has drawn near
the
hour
and
the
Son
-
of Man
is betrayed
into
[the] hands
of sinners
Rise up
let us go
Behold
has drawn near
he who
is betraying
Me
And
yet
of Him
as He is speaking
behold
Judas
one
of the
Twelve
came
and
with
him
a crowd
great
with
swords
and
clubs
from
the
chief priests
and
elders
of the
people
The [one]
then
betraying
Him
gave
them
a sign
saying
Whomever
-
I shall kiss
He
it is
seize
Him
And
immediately
having come up
-
to Jesus
he said
Greetings
Rabbi
and
kissed
Him
-
And
Jesus
said
to him
Friend
for
what
are you come
Then
having come to [him]
they laid
-
hands
on
-
Jesus
and
seized
Him
And
behold
one
of those
with
Jesus
having stretched out
the
hand
drew
the
sword
of him
and
having struck
the
servant
of the
high priest
cut off
of him
the
ear
Then
says
to him
-
Jesus
Return
the
sword
of you
into
the
place
of it
all
for
those
having taken
[the] sword
by
[the] sword
will perish
Or
think you
that
not
I am able
to call upon
the
Father
of Me
and
He will furnish
to Me
presently
more than
twelve
legions
of angels
How
then
should be fulfilled
the
Scriptures
that
so
it must
be
In
that
-
hour
said
-
Jesus
to the
crowds
As
against
a robber
did you come out
with
swords
and
clubs
to capture
Me
Every
day
in
the
temple
I was sitting
teaching
and
not
you did seize
Me
This
then
all
is come to pass
that
might be fulfilled
the
Scriptures
of the
prophets
Then
the
disciples
all
having forsaken
Him
fled
Those
then
having seized
-
Jesus
led [Him] away
to
Caiaphas
the
high priest
where
the
scribes
and
the
elders
were assembled
-
And
Peter
was following
Him
from
afar
even
to the
court
of the
high priest
And
having entered
within
he was sitting
with
the
guards
to see
the
outcome
-
And
the chief priests
and
the
Council
whole
were seeking
false testimony
against
-
Jesus
so that
him
they might put to death
but
not any
they found
of many
having come forward as
false witnesses
At last
then
having come forward
two
they said
This [man]
has been saying
I am able
to destroy
the
temple
-
of God
and
in
three
days
to rebuild it
And
having stood up
the
high priest
said
to Him
Nothing
answer you
What
these
you
do witness against
-
And
Jesus
was silent
And
the
high priest
said
to Him
I adjure
you
by
-
God
the
living
that
us
You tell
if
You
are
the
Christ
the
Son
-
of God
Says
to him
-
Jesus
You
have said
But
I say
to you
from
now
you will see
the
Son
-
of Man
sitting
at
[the] right hand
-
of Power
and
coming
upon
the
clouds
-
of heaven
Then
the
high priest
tears
the
garments
of him
saying
He has blasphemed
why
any more
need
have we
of witnesses
Behold
now
you have heard
the
blasphemy
What
you
do think
-
And
answering
they said
Deserving
of death
He is
Then
they spat
in
the
face
of Him
and
struck
Him
Others
then
slapped [Him]
saying
Prophesy
to us
Christ
who
is
the [one]
having struck
You
-
And
Peter
was sitting
outside
in
the
court
and
came
to him
one
servant girl
saying
Also
You
were
with
Jesus
the
Galilean
-
And
he denied
before
all
saying
Not
I know
what
you say
Having gone out
then
to
the
porch
saw
him
another [servant girl]
and
says
to those
there
This [man]
was
with
Jesus
of
Nazareth
And
again
he denied
with
an oath
-
Not
I know
the
man
After
a little while
also
having come to [him]
those
standing by
they said
-
to Peter
Surely
also
you
of
them
are
even
for
the
speech
of you
away
you
gives
Then
he began
to curse
and
to swear
-
Not
I know
the
man
And
immediately
a rooster
crowed
And
remembered
-
Peter
the
word
of Jesus
He having said
-
Before [the]
rooster
crowing
three times
you will deny
Me
And
having gone
out
he wept
bitterly
Morning
then
having arrived
counsel
took
all
the
chief priests
and
the
elders
of the
people
against
-
Jesus
so that
they might put to death
him
And
having bound
Him
they led away [Him]
and
delivered Him to
Pilate
the
governor
Then
having seen
Judas
the [one]
having delivered up
Him
that
He was condemned
having regretted [it]
he returned
the
thirty
pieces of silver
to the
chief priests
and
elders
saying
I sinned
having betrayed
blood
innocent
-
Then
they said
What [is that]
to
us
You
will see
And
having cast down
the
pieces of silver
into
the
temple
he withdrew
and
having gone away
hanged himself
-
And
the chief priests
having taken
the
pieces of silver
said
Not
it is lawful
to put
them
into
the
treasury
since [the]
price
of blood
it is
Counsel
then
having taken
they bought
with
them
the
field
of the
potter
for
a burial place
for the
strangers
Therefore
was called
the
field
that
Field
of Blood
to
-
this day
Then
was fulfilled
that
having been spoken
by
Jeremiah
the
prophet
saying
And
they took
the
thirty
pieces of silver
the
price
of the [One]
having been priced
whom
they set a price on
by [the]
sons
of Israel
and
they gave
them
for
the
field
of the
potter
as
directed
me
[the] Lord
-
And
Jesus
stood
before
the
governor
and
questioned
Him
the
governor
saying
You
are
the
King
of the
Jews
-
And
Jesus
said
You
say
And
in
-
being accused
His
by
the
chief priests
and
elders
nothing
He answered
Then
says
to Him
-
Pilate
Not
do you hear
how many things
You
they witness against
And
not
He did answer
him
to
not even
one
word
so as
to amaze
the
governor
exceedingly
At
now
[the] feast
was accustomed
the
governor
to release
one
to the
multitude
prisoner
whom
they were wishing
They were holding
now
at that time
a prisoner
notable
called
Barabbas
Being gathered together
therefore
of them
said
to them
-
Pilate
Whom
will you [that]
I shall release
to you
Barabbas
or
Jesus
who
is called
Christ
He knew
for
that
through
envy
they delivered up
him
As was sitting
now
he
on
the
judgment seat
sent
to
him
the
wife
of him
saying
[Let there be] nothing
between you
and
the
righteous [man]
that
many things
for
I suffered
today
in
a dream
because of
Him
-
And
the chief priests
and
the
elders
persuaded
the
crowds
that
they should ask for
-
Barabbas
-
and
Jesus
should destroy
Answering
now
the
governor
said
to them
Which
do you desire
of
the
two
I release
to you
-
And
they said
-
Barabbas
Says
to them
-
Pilate
What
then
should I do with
Jesus
who
is called
Christ
They say
all
Let [Him] be crucified
-
And
he said
What
for
evil
did He commit
-
And
all the more
they kept crying out
saying
Let [Him] be crucified
Having seen
now
-
Pilate
that
nothing
it availed
but
rather
a riot
is arising
having taken
water
he washed
the
hands
before
the
crowd
saying
Guiltless
I am
of
the
blood
of this
For yourselves
you will see
And
answering
all
the
people
said
The
blood
of Him
[be] on
us
and
on
the
children
of us
Then
he released
to them
-
Barabbas
-
and
Jesus
having flogged
He delivered up [Him]
that
He might be crucified
Then
the
soldiers
of the
governor
having taken with [them]
-
Jesus
to
the
Praetorium
gathered
before
Him
all
the
cohort
And
having stripped
Him
a robe
scarlet
they put around
Him
And
having twisted together
a crown
of
thorns
they put [it]
on
the
head
of Him
and
a reed
in
the
right hand
of Him
and
having bowed the knees
before
Him
they mocked
Him
saying
Hail
King
of the
Jews
And
having spit
upon
Him
they took
the
reed
and
kept striking [Him]
on
the
head
of Him
And
when
they had mocked
Him
they took off
Him
the
robe
and
they put on
Him
the
garments
of Him
and
led away
Him
to
-
crucify [Him]
Going forth
now
they found
a man
of Cyrene
named
Simon
Him
they compelled
that
he might carry
the
cross
of Him
And
having come
to
a place
called
Golgotha
which
is
of a Skull
Place
called
they gave
Him
to drink
wine
with
gall
mingled
and
having tasted
not
He was willing
to drink [it]
Having crucified
now
Him
they divided
the
garments
of Him
casting
lots
And
sitting down
they were guarding
Him
there
And
they put up
over
the
head
of Him
the
accusation
of Him
written
This
is
Jesus
the
King
of the
Jews
At the same time
are crucified
with
Him
two
robbers
one
at [the]
right hand
and
one
at [the]
left
Those
now
passing by
kept railing at
Him
wagging
the
heads
of them
and
saying
The [One]
destroying
the
temple
and
in
three
days
building [it]
save
Yourself
If
[the] Son
You are
-
of God
also
descend
from
the
cross
Likewise
the
chief priests
mocking
with
the
scribes
and
elders
were saying
Others
He saved
Himself
not
is He able
to save
King
of Israel
He is
Let Him descend
now
from
the
cross
and
we will believe
in
Him
He trusted
on
-
God
Let Him deliver
now
if
He wants
Him
He said
for
-
Of God
I am
[the] Son
-
And
likewise
even
the
robbers
those
having been crucified
with
Him
were upbraiding
Him
From
then
[the] sixth
hour
darkness
was
over
all
the
land
until
[the] hour
ninth
About
then
the
ninth
hour
cried out
-
Jesus
in a voice
loud
saying
Eli
Eli
lema
sabachthani
That
is
God
of Me
God
of Me
so that
why
Me
have you forsaken
Some
then
of those who
there
were standing
having heard
began saying
-
Elijah
calls
this [man]
And
immediately
having run
one
of
them
and
having taken
a sponge
having filled [it]
and
with vinegar
and
having put [it] on
a reed
gave to drink
Him
-
And
the rest
were saying
Let be
Let us see
whether
comes
Elijah
to save
Him
-
And
Jesus
again
having cried
in a voice
loud
yielded up
[His]
spirit
And
behold
the
veil
of the
temple
was torn
from
top
to
bottom
into
two
and
the
earth
was shaken
and
the
rocks
were split
and
the
tombs
were opened
and
many
bodies
of the
having fallen asleep
saints
arose
and
having gone forth
out of
the
tombs
after
the
resurrection
of Him
they entered
into
the
holy
city
and
appeared
to many
-
And
the centurion
and
those
with
him
keeping guard over
-
Jesus
having seen
the
earthquake
and
the things
taking place
feared
greatly
saying
Truly
Godâs
Son
was
this
They were
now
there
women
many
from
afar off
looking on
who
followed
-
Jesus
from
-
Galilee
ministering
to Him
among
whom
was
Mary
-
Magdalene
and
Mary
the
-
of James
and
Joseph
mother
and
the
mother
of the
sons
of Zebedee
Evening
now
having arrived
came
a man
rich
from
Arimathea
named
Joseph
who
also
himself
was discipled
-
to Jesus
He
having gone
-
to Pilate
asked for
the
body
-
of Jesus
Then
-
Pilate
commanded it
to be given up
And
having taken
the
body
-
Joseph
wrapped
it
in
a linen cloth
clean
and
placed
it
in
the
new
of him
tomb
which
he had cut
in
the
rock
and
having rolled
a stone
great
to the
door
of the
tomb
he went away
Was
now
there
Mary
-
Magdalene
and
the
other
Mary
sitting
opposite
the
tomb
-
And
the next day
which
is
after
the
Preparation
were gathered together
the
chief priests
and
the
Pharisees
before
Pilate
saying
Sir
we have remembered
how
that
-
deceiver
said
while
living
After
three
days
I arise
Command
therefore
to be secured
the
tomb
until
the
third
day
lest
ever
having come
the
disciples
steal away
him
and
say
to the
people
He is risen
from
the
dead
And
will be
the
last
deception
worse
than the
first
Said
to them
-
Pilate
You have
a guard
Go
make [it as] secure
as
you know [how]
-
And
having gone
they made secure
the
tomb
having sealed
the
stone
with
the
guard
After
then
[the] Sabbaths
it
being dawn
toward
[the] first [day]
of [the] week
came
Mary
-
Magdalene
and
the
other
Mary
to see
the
tomb
And
behold
an earthquake
there was
great
an angel
for
of [the] Lord
having descended
out of
heaven
and
having come
rolled away
the
stone
and
was sitting
upon
it
Was
now
the
appearance
of him
like
lightning
and
the
clothing
of him
white
as
snow
From
now
the
fear
of him
trembled
those
keeping guard
and
became
as
dead [men]
Answering
now
the
angel
said
to the
women
Not
fear
you
I know
for
that
Jesus
the [One]
having been crucified
you seek
Not
He is
here
He is risen
for
as
He said
Come
see
the
place
where
He was lying
And
quickly
having gone
say
to the
disciples
of Him
that
He is risen
from
the
dead
and
behold
He goes before
you
into
-
Galilee
there
Him
you will see
Behold
I have told
you
And
having gone out
quickly
from
the
tomb
with
fear
and
joy
great
they ran
to tell
the
disciples
of Him
And
behold
Jesus
met
them
saying
Greetings
-
And
having come to [Him]
they took hold of
His
-
feet
and
worshiped
Him
Then
says
to them
-
Jesus
Not
fear
Go
tell
the
brothers
of Me
so that
they should go
into
-
Galilee
and there
Me
will they see
[As] were going
now
they
behold
some
of the
guard
having gone
into
the
city
reported
to the
chief priests
all
the things
having been done
And
having been gathered together
with
the
elders
counsel
then
having taken
silver pieces
many
they gave
to the
soldiers
saying
Say
that
the
disciples
of Him
by night
having come
stole
Him
we
being asleep
And
if
is heard
this
by
the
governor
we
will persuade
and
you
out of trouble
will keep
-
And
having taken
money
they did
as
they were instructed
And
is spread abroad
the
report
this
among [the]
Jews
until
the
present
day
-
And
the eleven
disciples
went
into
-
Galilee
to
the
mountain
where
assigned
them
-
Jesus
And
having seen
Him
they worshiped
some
however
doubted
And
having come to [them]
-
Jesus
spoke
to them
saying
Has been given
to Me
all
authority
in
heaven
and
on
the
earth
Having gone
therefore
disciple
all
the
nations
baptizing
them
in
the
name
of the
Father
and
of the
Son
and
of the
Holy
Spirit
teaching
them
to observe
all things
whatever
I commanded
you
And
behold
I
with
you
am
all
the
days
until
the
completion
of the
age
[The] beginning
of the
gospel
of Jesus
Christ
Son
of God
As
it has been written
in
-
Isaiah
the
prophet
Behold
I send
the
messenger
of Me
before
face
of You
who
will prepare
the
way
of You
[The] voice
of one crying
in
the
wilderness
Prepare
the
way
of [the] Lord
straight
make
the
paths
of Him
Came
John
-
baptizing
in
the
wilderness
proclaiming
[a] baptism
of repentance
for
forgiveness
of sins
And
were going out
to
him
all
the
of Judea
region
and
-
of Jerusalem
all
and
were being baptized
by
him
in
the
Jordan
river
confessing
the
sins
of them
And
was
-
John
clothed in
hair
of a camel
and
a belt
of leather
around
the
waist
of him
and
he is eating
locusts
and
honey
wild
And
he was preaching
saying
He comes
who
[is] mightier
than I
after
me
of whom
not
I am
sufficient
having stooped down
to untie
the
strap
of the
sandals
of Him
I
baptized
you
with water
He
however
will baptize
you
[the] Spirit
Holy
And
it came to pass
in
those
-
days
[that] came
Jesus
from
Nazareth
-
of Galilee
and
was baptized
in
the
Jordan
by
John
And
immediately
going up
from
the
water
he saw
tearing open
the
heavens
and
the
Spirit
as
a dove
descending
upon
Him
And
a voice
came
out of
the
heavens
You
are
the
Son
of Me
the
beloved
in
You
I am well pleased
And
immediately
the
Spirit
Him
drives out
into
the
wilderness
And
He was
in
the
wilderness
forty
days
being tempted
by
-
Satan
And
He was
with
the
wild animals
and
the
angels
were ministering
to Him
And
after
the
delivering up
-
of John
came
-
Jesus
into
-
Galilee
proclaiming
the
gospel
-
of God
and
saying
-
Has been fulfilled
the
time
and
has drawn near
the
kingdom
-
of God
repent
and
believe
in
the
gospel
And
passing
by
the
Sea
-
of Galilee
He saw
Simon
and
Andrew
the
brother
of Simon
casting a net
into
the
sea
they were
for
fishermen
And
said
to them
-
Jesus
Come
after
Me
and
I will make
you
to become
fishers
of men
And
immediately
having left
the
nets
they followed
Him
And
having gone on
a little
He saw
James
the [son]
-
of Zebedee
and
John
the
brother
of him
and
they
[were] in
the
boat
adjusting
the
nets
And
immediately
He called
them
and
having left
the
father
of them
Zebedee
in
the
boat
with
the
hired servants
they went away
after
Him
And
they go
into
Capernaum
and
immediately
on the
Sabbaths
having entered
into
the
synagogue
He was teaching
And
they were astonished
at
the
teaching
of Him
He was
for
teaching
them
as
authority
having
and
not
as
the
scribes
And
immediately
there was
in
the
synagogue
of them
a man
with
a spirit
unclean
and
he cried out
saying
What
to us
and
to You
Jesus
of Nazareth
Did You come
to destroy
us
I know
You
who
are
the
Holy [One]
-
of God
And
rebuked
him
-
Jesus
Be silent
and
come forth
out of
him
And
having thrown into convulsions
him
the
spirit
-
unclean
and
having cried
in a voice
loud
it came forth
out of
him
And
were astonished
all
so as
to question
themselves
saying
What
is
this
teaching
new
With
authority
even
the
spirits
-
unclean
He commands
and
they obey
Him
And
went out
the
news
of Him
immediately
everywhere
into
all
the
surrounding region
-
of Galilee
And
immediately
out of
the
synagogue
having gone forth
they came
into
the
house
of Simon
and
Andrew
with
James
and
John
-
and
the mother-in-law
of Simon
was laying sick
fevering
And
immediately
they speak
to Him
about
her
And
having come to [her]
He raised up
her
having taken hold
of the
hand
And
left
her
the
fever
and
she began to minister
to them
Evening
now
having come
when
went down
the
sun
they began bringing
to
Him
all
those
sick
being
and
those
being possessed by demons
And
was
all
the
city
gathered together
at
the
door
And
He healed
many
sick
being
of various
diseases
and
demons
many
He cast out
And
not
He would allow
to speak
the
demons
because
they knew
Him
And
very early
in night
still much
having risen up
He went out
and
departed
into
solitary
a place
and there
He was praying
And
went after
Him
Simon
and
those
with
him
and
having found
Him
also
they say
to Him
-
Everyone
seeks
You
And
He says
to them
Let us go
another way
into
the
neighboring
towns
so that
also
there
I might preach
for
this
therefore
have I come forth
And
He was going
preaching
in
the
synagogues
of them
in
all
-
Galilee
and
-
demons
casting out
And
comes
to
Him
a leper
imploring
Him
and
kneeling down to Him
saying
to Him
-
If
You are willing
You are able
me
to cleanse
And
having been moved with compassion
having stretched out
the
hand
of Him
He touched him
and
says
to him
I am willing
be you cleansed
And
immediately
departed
from
him
the
leprosy
and
he was cleansed
And
having sternly warned
him
immediately
He sent away
him
And
He says
to him
See [that]
nothing
to none
you speak
But
go
yourself
show
to the
priest
and
offer
for
the
cleansing
of you
what
commanded
Moses
for
a testimony
to them
-
And
having gone out
he began
to proclaim
much
and
to spread abroad
the
matter
so that
no longer
He
was able
openly
into [the]
city
to enter
but
out
in
solitary
places
He was
and
they were coming
to
Him
from every quarter
And
He having entered
again
into
Capernaum
after [some]
days
it was heard
that
in
[the] house
He is
And
were gathered together
many
so that
no more
to have space
not even
-
at
the
door
and
He was speaking
to them
the
word
And
they come
bringing
to
Him
a paralytic
being carried
by
four
And
not
being able
to come near
to Him
on account of
the
crowd
they removed
the
roof
where
He was
and
having broken up [it]
they let down
the
pallet
on which
the
paralytic
was lying
And
having seen
-
Jesus
the
faith
of them
He says
to the
paralytic
Son
are forgiven
of you
the
sins
Were
now
some
of the
scribes
there
sitting
and
reasoning
in
the
hearts
of them
Why
this [man]
thus
does speak
He blasphemes
Who
is able
to forgive
sins
if
not
alone
-
God
And
immediately
having known
-
Jesus
in the
spirit
of Him
that
thus
they are reasoning
within
themselves
He says
to them
Why
these things
reason you
in
the
hearts
of you
Which
is
easier
to say
to the
paralytic
Are forgiven
of you
the
sins
or
to say
Arise
and
take up
the
mat
of you
and
walk
That
however
you might know
that
authority
has
the
Son
-
of Man
to forgive
sins
on
the
earth
He says
to the
paralytic
To you
I say
arise
take up
the
mat
of you
and
go
to
the
home
of you
And
he arose
and
immediately
having taken up
the
mat
he went forth
before
all
so as for
to be amazed
all
and
to glorify
-
God
saying
-
Thus
never
did we see
And
He went forth
again
beside
the
sea
and
all
the
crowd
was coming
to
Him
and
He taught
them
And
passing on
He saw
Levi
the [son]
-
of Alphaeus
sitting
at
the
tax booth
and
He says
to him
Follow
Me
And
having arisen
he followed
Him
And
it came to pass
reclining
of Him
in
the
house
of him
that
many
tax collectors
and
sinners
were reclining with
-
Jesus
and
the
disciples
of Him
there were
for
many
and
they were following
Him
And
the
scribes
of the
Pharisees
having seen
Him
eating
with
the
sinners
and
tax collectors
were saying
to the
disciples
of Him
Why
with
the
tax collectors
and
sinners
does He eat
And
having heard
-
Jesus
says
to them
No
need
have
those
being strong
of a physician
but
those
sick
being
Not
I came
to call
[the] righteous
but
sinners
And
were
the
disciples
of John
and
the
Pharisees
fasting
And
they come
and
say
to Him
Because of
why
the
disciples
of John
and
the
disciples
of the
Pharisees
fast
-
but
Your
disciples
not
fast
And
said
to them
-
Jesus
Not
are able
the
sons
of the
bridechamber
in
which
the
bridegroom
with
them
is
to fast
As long as
time
they have
the
bridegroom
with
them
not
they are able
to fast
Will come
however
[the] days
when
will have been taken away
from
them
the
bridegroom
and
then
they will fast
in
those
the
days
No one
a patch
of cloth
unshrunk
sews
on
clothing
old
if
now
not
tears away
the
patch
from
it
-
new
from the
old
And
worse
a tear
takes place
And
no one
puts
wine
new
into
wineskins
old
if
now
not
will burst
the
wine
the
wineskins
and
the
wine
will be destroyed
and
the
wineskins
Instead
wine
new
into
wineskins
new
And
it came to pass
He
on
the
Sabbaths
is passing
through
the
grainfields
and
the
disciples
of Him
began
[their] way
to make
plucking
the
heads of grain
And
the
Pharisees
were saying
to Him
Behold
why
do they
on the
Sabbaths
that which
not
is lawful
And
He said
to them
Never
did you read
what
did
David
when
need
he had
and
hungered
he
and
those
with
him
How
he entered
into
the
house
-
of God
in [the days of]
Abiathar
the high priest
and
the
loaves
of the
presentation
ate
which
not
it is lawful
to eat
if
not
for the
priests
And
he gave
even
to those
with
him
being
And
He said
to them
The
Sabbath
on account of
the
man
was made
and
not
the
man
on account of
the
Sabbath
So then
Lord
is
the
Son
-
of Man
also even
of the
Sabbath
And
He entered
again
into
synagogue
and
there was
there
a man
withered
having
the
hand
and
they were watching
Him
whether
on the
Sabbaths
He will heal
him
in order that
they might accuse
Him
And
He says
to the
man
-
the
hand
having
withered
Arise
into
the
midst
And
He says
to them
Is it lawful
on the
Sabbaths
to do good

or
to do evil
Life
to save
or
to kill
-
But
they were silent
And
having looked around on
them
with
anger
being grieved
at
the
hardness
of the
heart
of them
He says
to the
man
Stretch out
the
hand
And
he stretched [it] out
and
was restored
the
hand
of him
And
having gone out
the
Pharisees
immediately
with
the
Herodians
counsel
began to take
against
Him
how
Him
they might destroy
And
-
Jesus
with
the
disciples
of Him
withdrew
to
the
sea
and
great
a multitude
from
-
Galilee
followed
and
from
-
Judea
and
from
Jerusalem
and
from
-
Idumea
and
beyond
the
Jordan
and
around
Tyre
and
Sidon
A multitude
great
having heard
how much
He was doing
came
to
Him
And
He spoke
to the
disciples
of Him
that
a boat
might wait upon
Him
on account of
the
crowd
that
not
they might press upon
Him
Many
for
He healed
so as for
to press upon
Him
that
Him
they might touch
as many as
had
diseases
And
the
spirits
-
unclean
whenever
Him
they beheld
were falling down before
Him
and
crying out
saying
-
You
are
the
Son
-
of God
And
much
He would rebuke
them
so that
not
Him
known
they should make
And
He goes up
on
the
mountain
and
calls near
those whom
he wanted
Himself
and
they went
to
Him
And
He appointed
twelve
that
they might be
with
Him
and
that
He might send
them
to preach
and
to have
authority
to cast out
-
demons
And
He appointed
the
Twelve
And
He added
[the] name
to
Simon
Peter
and
James
the [son]
of
Zebedee
and
John
the
brother
-
of James
and
He added
to them [the]
name
Boanerges
which
is
Sons
of thunder
and
Andrew
and
Philip
and
Bartholomew
and
Matthew
and
Thomas
and
James
the [son]
-
of Alphaeus
and
Thaddaeus
and
Simon
the
Zealot
and
Judas
Iscariot
who
also
betrayed
Him
And
He comes
to
a house
and
comes together
again
a
crowd
so that
not
are they able
them
even
bread
to eat
And
having heard [of it]
those
belonging to
Him
went out
to seize
Him
they were saying
for
-
He is out of His mind
And
the
scribes
those
from
Jerusalem
having come down
were saying
-
Beelzebul
He has
and
-
By
the
prince
of the
demons
He casts out
the
demons
And
having called to [Him]
them
in
parables
He began speaking
to them
How
is able
Satan
Satan
to cast out
And
if
a kingdom
against
itself
is divided
not
is able
to stand
the
kingdom
that
And
if
a house
against
itself
is divided
not
will be able
the
house
that
to stand
And
if
-
Satan
has risen up
against
himself
and
has been divided
not
he is able
to stand
but
an end
is coming to
But
not
is able
no one
into
the
house
of the
strong man
having entered
the
goods
of him
to plunder
if
not
first
the
strong man
he binds
And
then
the
house
of him
he will plunder
Truly
I say
to you
that
all
will be forgiven
the
sons
the
of men
the
sins
and
the
blasphemies
as many as
if
they shall have blasphemed
Whoever
however
-
shall blaspheme
against
the
Spirit
-
Holy
not
has
forgiveness
to
the
age
but
guilty
is
[of] eternal
sin
For
they were saying
A spirit
unclean
he has
And
arrive
the
mother
of Him
and
the
brothers
of Him
and
outside
standing
sent
to
Him
calling
Him
And
was sitting
around
Him
a crowd
And
they said
to Him
Behold
the
mother
of You
and
the
brothers
of You
and
the
sister
of you
outside
are seeking
You
And
He answering
them
says
Who
are
the
mother
of Me
and
the
brothers
And
having looked around on
those who
around
Him
in a circle
were sitting
He says
Behold
the
mother
of Me
and
the
brothers
of Me
Whoever
-
shall do
the
will
-
of God
he
brother
of Me
and
sister
and
mother
is
And
again
He began
to teach
beside
the
sea
And
was gathered together
to
Him
a crowd
great
so that
He
into
a boat
having entered
sat
in
the
sea
and
all
the
crowd
close to
the
sea
on
the
land
was
And
He began teaching
them
in
parables
many things
and
He was saying
to them
in
the
teaching
of Him
Listen
Behold
went out
the [one]
sowing
to sow
And
it came to pass
as
-
he sowed
some
-
fell
along
the
road
and
came
the
birds
and
devoured
it
And
other
fell
upon
the
rocky place
where
not
it had
soil
much
and
immediately
it sprang up
because of
the
not
having
depth
of soil
And
after
rose
the
sun
it was scorched
and
because of
-
not
having
root
it withered away
And
other
fell
among
the
thorns
and
grew up
the
thorns
and
choked
it
and
fruit
no
it yielded
And
other
fell
into
the
soil
-
good
and
began yielding
fruit
growing up
and
increasing
and
bearing
one
thirtyfold
and
one
sixty
and
one
a hundred
And
He was saying
He who
has
ears
to hear
let him hear
And
when
He was
with
alone
began asking
Him
those
around
Him
with
the
Twelve
about the
parable
And
He was saying
to them
To you
the
mystery
has been given
of the
kingdom
-
of God
To those
however
who are
outside
in
parables
-
everything
is done
so that
Seeing
they might see
and
not
perceive
and
hearing
they might hear
and
not
understand
lest
ever
they should turn
and
should be forgiven
them
And
He says
to them
Not
understand you
the
parable
this
And
how
all
the
parables
will you understand
The [one]
sowing
the
word
sows
These
now
are
they
along
the
road
where
is sown
the
word
and
when
they hear
immediately
comes
-
Satan
and
takes away
the
word
-
having been sown
in
them
And
these
are
likewise
those
upon
the
rocky places
sown
who
when
they hear
the
word
immediately
with
joy
receive
it
and
not
they have
root
in
themselves
but
temporary
are
then
having arisen
tribulation
or
persecution
on account of
the
word
immediately
they fall away
And
these
are
those
among
the
thorns
sown
These
are
those
the
word
having heard
and
the
cares
-
of this age
and
the
deceit
of the
riches
and
-
of
the
other things
desires
entering in
choke
the
word
and
unfruitful
it becomes
And
these
are
those
upon
the
soil
-
good
having been sown
such as
hear
the
word
and
receive [it]
and
bring forth fruit
one
thirtyfold
and
one
sixty
and
one
a hundred
And
He was saying
to them
-
Not
is brought in
the
lamp
so that
under
the
basket
it might be put
or
under
the
bed
[Is it] not
that
upon
the
lampstand
it might be put
Nothing
for
there is
which [is]
hidden
if
not
that
it should be made manifest
nor
has taken place
a secret thing
but
that
it should come
to
light
If
anyone
has
ears
to hear
let him hear
And
He was saying
to them
Take heed
what
you hear
With
what
measure
you measure
it will be measured
to you
and
more will be added
to you
Whoever
for
may have
it will be given
to him
and
he who
not
has
even
that which
he has
will be taken away
from
him
And
He was saying
Thus
is
the
kingdom
-
of God
as
a man
should cast
the
seed
upon
the
earth
and
should sleep
and
rise
night
and
day
and
the
seed
should sprout
and
grow
how
not
knows
he
Of itself
the
earth
brings forth fruit
first
a plant
then
an ear
then
full
grain
in
the
ear
When
then
offers itself
the
fruit
immediately
he sends
the
sickle
for
has come
the
harvest
And
He was saying
To what
shall we liken
the
kingdom
-
of God
Or
in
what
it
parable
shall we present
As
to a grain
of mustard
which
when
it has been sown
upon
the
earth
smallest
is
of all
the
seeds
which [are]
upon
the
earth
and
when
it has been sown
it grows up
and
becomes
greater
than all
the
garden plants
and
it produces
branches
great
so that
are able
under
the
shadow
of it
the
birds
of the
air
to perch
And
with such
parables
many
He kept speaking
to them
the
word
as
they were able
to hear
Without
then
parables
not
would He speak
to them
in
private
however
to His
own
disciples
He would explain
all things
And
He says
to them
on
that
-
day
evening
having come
Let us pass over
to
the
other side
And
having dismissed
the
crowd
they take with [them]
Him
since
He was
in
the
boat
also
other
boats
were
with
Him
And
comes
a storm
violent
of wind
And
the
waves
were breaking
over
the
boat
so that
already
is being filled up
the
boat
And
He
was
in
the
stern
on
the
cushion
sleeping
And
they awaken
Him
and
say
to Him
Teacher
not
is it concern
to You
that
we perish
And
having been awoken
He rebuked
the
wind
and
said
to the
sea
Silence
be still
And
abated
the
wind
and
there was
a calm
great
And
He said
to them
Why
fearful
are you
Still not


have you
faith
And
they feared
[with] fear
great
and
were saying
to
each other
Who
then
this
is
that
even
the
wind
and
the
sea
obey
Him
And
they came
to
the
other side
of the
sea
to
the
region
of the
Gerasenes
And
having gone forth
of Him
out of
the
boat
immediately
met
Him
out of
the
tombs
a man
with
a spirit
unclean
who
the
dwelling
had
in
the
tombs
And
not even
with chains
no longer
anyone
was able
him
to bind
because
that
he
often
with shackles
and
chains
had been bound
and
had been torn in two
by
him
the
chains
and
the
shackles
had been shattered
and
no one
was able
him
to subdue
And
constantly
all
night
and
day
in
the
tombs
and
in
the
mountains
he was
crying out
and
cutting
himself
with stones
And
having seen
-
Jesus
from
afar
he ran
and
fell on his knees
before Him
And
having cried
in a voice
loud
he said
What
to me
and
to You
Jesus
Son
-
of God
the
Most High
I adjure
You
-
by God
not
me
torment
He was saying
for
to him
You come forth
the
spirit
-
unclean
out of
the
man
And
He was asking
him
What [is]
[the] name
of you
And
saying
he answered
Legion
[is] name
to Me
because
many
we are
And
he begged
Him
numerous times
that
not
them
He would send
out of
the
country
There was
now
there
near
the
mountain
a herd
of pigs
great
feeding
And
they begged
Him
saying
Send
us
into
the
pigs
so that
into
them
we may enter
And
He allowed
them
And
having gone out
the
spirits
-
unclean
entered
into
the
pigs
and
rushed
the
herd
down
the
steep bank
into
the
sea
about
two thousand
and
they were drowned
in
the
sea
And
those
feeding
them
fled
and
proclaimed [it]
to
the
city
and
to
the
country
And
they went out
to see
what
it is
that
has been done
And
they come
to
-
Jesus
and
see
the [man]
possessed by demons
sitting
clothed
and
sound minded
the [one]
having had
the
legion
and
they were afraid
And
related
to them
those
having seen [it]
how
it happened
to the [one]
being possessed by demons
and
concerning
the
pigs
And
they began
to implore
Him
to depart
from
the
region
of them
And
having entered
He
into
the
boat
was begging
Him
the [one]
having been possessed by demons
that
with
Him
he might be
And
not
He did permit
him
but
He says
to him
Go
to
the
home
of you
to
-
your own
and
report
to them
how much
the
Lord
for you
did
and
had mercy on
you
And
he departed
and
began
to proclaim
in
the
Decapolis
how much
had done
for him
-
Jesus
and
all
were marveling
And
having passed over
-
Jesus
in
the
boat
again
to
the
other side
was gathered
a crowd
great
to
Him
and
He was
beside
the
sea
And
comes
one
of the
synagogue rulers
named
Jairus
and
having seen
Him
falls
at
the
feet
of Him
and
he begs
Him
much
saying
-
The
little daughter
of me
at the end
is holding
that
having come
You would lay
the
hands
on her
so that
she might be cured
and
she shall live
And
He departed
with
him
And
was following
Him
a crowd
great
and
pressing in on
Him
And
a woman
being
with
a flux
of blood
twelve
years
and
much
having suffered
under
many
physicians
and
having spent
the
of
her
all
and
in no way
having benefited
but
rather
to
the
worse
having come
having heard
-
concerning
-
Jesus
having come up
in
the
crowd
behind
she touched
the
clothing
of Him
She was saying
for
-
If
I shall touch
even
the
garments
of Him
I will be healed
And
immediately
was dried up
the
flow
of the
blood
of her
and
she knew
in the
body
that
she was healed
from
the
affliction
And
immediately
-
Jesus
having known
in
Himself
the
out of
Him
power
having gone forth
having turned
in
the
crowd
said
Who
of Me
touched
the
garments
And
were saying
to Him
the
disciples
of Him
You see
the
crowd
pressing in on
You
and
say You
Who
Me
touched
And
He was looking around
to see
the [one]
this
having done
-
And
the woman
having been frightened
and
trembling
knowing
what
had been done
to her
came
and
fell down before
Him
and
told
Him
all
the
truth
-
And
He said
to her
Daughter
the
faith
of you
has healed
you
go
in
peace
and
be
sound
from
the
affliction
of you
[While] yet
He
is speaking
they come
from
the
ruler of synagogueâs [house]
saying
-
The
daughter
of You
is dead
why
still
trouble you
the
Teacher
-
And
Jesus
having heard
the
word
spoken
says
to the
ruler of the synagogue
Not
fear
only
believe
And
not
He allowed
no one
with
Him
to follow
if
not
-
Peter
and
James
and
John
the
brother
of James
And
they come
to
the
house
of the
ruler of the synagogue
and
He beholds
a commotion
and
weeping
and
wailing
much
And
having entered
He says
to them
Why
make you commotion
and
weep
The
child
not
is dead
but
sleeps
And
they were laughing at
Him
He
then
having put out
all
takes with [Him]
the
father
of the
child
and
the
mother
and
those
with
Him
and
enters in
where
was
the
child
And
having taken
the
hand
of the
child
He says
to her
Talitha
koum
Which
is
translated
-
Little girl
to you
I say
arise
And
immediately
arose
the
girl
and
began walking
she was
for
of years
twelve
And
they were overcome
immediately
with amazement
great
And
He instructed
them
strictly
that
no one
should know
this
and
He commanded
to be given
to her
to eat
And
He went out
from there
and
came
into
the
hometown
of Him
and
follow
Him
the
disciples
of Him
And
having come
[the] Sabbath
He began
to teach
in
the
synagogue
and
-
many
hearing
were astonished
saying
From where
to this [man]
these things
and
what [is]
the
wisdom
-
having been given
to Him
even
the
miracles
such
by
the
hands
of Him
are done
Not
this
is
the
carpenter
the
son
-
of Mary
and
brother
of James
and
Joseph
and
Judas
and
Simon
And
not
are
the
sisters
of Him
here
with
us
And
they took offense
at
Him
And
said
to them
-
Jesus
-
Not
is
a prophet
without honor
if
not
in
the
hometown
of him
and
among
-
relatives
of him
and
in
the
household
of him
And
not
He was able
there
to do
not any
work of power
if
not
on a few
sick
having laid
the
hands
He healed
And
He was amazed
because of
the
unbelief
of them
And
He was going
the
villages
around
teaching
And
He calls near
the
Twelve
and
He began
them
to send forth
two
[by] two
and
He gave
to them
authority
over the
spirits
-
unclean
And
He instructed
them
that
nothing
they should take
for [the]
journey
if
not
a staff
only
no
bread
nor
bag
nor
in
the
belt
money
but
wearing
sandals
and
not
put on
two
tunics
And
He would say
to them
Wherever
if
you enter
into
a house
there
remain
until
-
you go out
from there
And
whatever
-
place
not
will receive
you
nor
hear
you
departing
from there
shake off
the
dust
which [is]
under
the
feet
of you
for
a testimony
against them
And
having gone out
they preached
that
they should repent
And
demons
many
they were casting out
and
were anointing
with oil
many
sick
and
healing [them]
And
heard
-
King
Herod
well known
for
became
the
name
of Him
And
they were saying
-
John
the [one]
baptizing
is risen
out from
[the] dead
and
because of
this
operate
the
miraculous powers
in
him
Others
however
were saying
-
Elijah
He is
Others
now
were saying
-
A prophet
like
one
of the
prophets
Having heard
now
-
Herod
was saying
Whom
I
beheaded
John
he
is risen
Himself
for
-
Herod
having sent
seized
-
John
and
bound
him
in
prison
on account of
Herodias
the
wife
of Philip
the
brother
of him
because
her
he had married
Had been saying
for
-
John
-
to Herod
-
Not
it is lawful
for you
to have
the
wife
of the
brother
of you
-
And
Herodias
held it
against him
and
wished
him
to kill
and
not
was able
-
for
Herod
was afraid of
-
John
knowing
him
[to be] a man
righteous
and
holy
and
he kept safe
him
And
having heard
him
greatly
he was perplexed
and
gladly
him
heard
And
having come
[a] day
opportune
when
Herod
on the
birthday
of him
a banquet
made
to the
great men
of him
and
to the
chief captains
and
to the
leading [men]
-
of Galilee
and
having come in
the
daughter
of herself
-
Herodias
and
having danced
pleased
-
Herod
and
those
reclining with [him]
-
And
the king
said
to the
girl
Ask
me
whatever
if
you wish
and
I will give
to you
And
he swore
to her
that
if
me
you might ask
I will give
you
up to
half
of the
kingdom
of me
And
having gone out
she said
to the
mother
of her
What
shall I ask
-
And
she said
The
head
of John
the [one]
baptizing
And
having entered
immediately
with
haste
to
the
king
she asked
saying
I desire
that
at once
you give
to me
upon
a platter
the
head
of John
the
Baptist
And
encompassingly sorrowful
having been made
the
king
on account of
the
oaths
and
those
reclining with [him]
not
was he willing
to refuse
her
And
immediately
having sent
the
king
an executioner
he commanded
to be brought
the
head
of him
And
having gone
he beheaded
him
in
the

and
brought
the
head
of him
upon
a platter
and
gave
it
to the
girl
and
the
girl
gave
it
to the
mother
of her
And
having heard [it]
the
disciples
of him
came
and
took up
the
body
of him
and
laid
it
in
[a] tomb
And
are gathered together
the
apostles
to
-
Jesus
and
they related
to him
all things
what
they had done
and
what
they had taught
And
He said
to them
Come
you
yourselves
apart
own
to
[a] solitary
place
and
rest
a little
Were
for
those
coming
and
those
going
many
and
not even
to eat
had they opportunity
And
they went away
by
the
boat
into
[a] solitary
place
by
themselves
And
they saw
them
going
and
recognized
many
and
on foot
from
all
the
cities
ran together
there
and
went before
them
And
having gone out
He saw
a great
crowd
and
was moved with compassion
toward
them
because
they were
like
sheep
not
having
a shepherd
And
He began
to teach
them
many things
And
already
the hour
late
being
having come
to Him
the
disciples
of Him
were saying
-
Desolate
is
the
place
and
already [it is]
an hour
late
Dismiss
them
that
having gone
to
the
surrounding
region
and
villages
they might buy
for themselves
something
to eat
-
But
answering
He said
to them
Give
to them
you
[something] to eat
And
they say
to Him
Having gone
shall we buy
denarii
two hundred
of bread
and
give
them
to eat
-
And
He says
to them
How many
have you
loaves
Go
see
And
having known
they say
Five
and
two
fish
And
He commanded
them
to make recline
all
groups
[by] groups
on
the
green
grass
And
they sat down
groups
[by] groups
by
hundreds
and
by
fifties
And
having taken
the
five
loaves
and
the
two
fish
having looked up
to
the
heaven
He blessed
and
broke
the
loaves
and
He kept giving [them]
to the
disciples
that
they might set before
them
And
the
two
fish
He divided
among all
And
ate
all
and
were satisfied
And
they took up
of fragments
twelve
hand-baskets
full
and
of
the
fish
And
were
those
having eaten of
the
loaves
five thousand
men
And
immediately
He compelled
the
disciples
of Him
to enter
into
the
boat
and
to go before
to
the
other side
to
Bethsaida
until
He
should dismiss
the
crowd
And
having taken leave of
them
He departed
into
the
mountain
to pray
And
evening
having come
was
the
boat
in
the midst
of the
sea
and
He
alone
upon
the
land
And
He having seen
them
straining
in
the
rowing
was
for
the
wind
contrary
to them
About
[the] fourth
watch
of the
night
He comes
to
them
walking
on
the
sea
and
He was wishing
to pass by
them
-
And
having seen
Him
on
the
sea
walking
they thought
that
a ghost
[it] is
and
cried out
All
for
Him
saw
and
were troubled
-
And
immediately
He spoke
with
them
and
says
to them
Take courage
I
am [He]
not
fear
And
He went up
to
them
into
the
boat
and
ceased
the
wind
And
exceedingly
in
abundance
in
themselves
they were amazed
not
for
they understood
by
the
loaves
but
had been
of them
the
heart
hardened
And
having passed over
to
the
land
they came
to
Gennesaret
and
drew to shore
And
on having come
of them
out of
the
boat
immediately
having recognized
Him
they ran around
all
the
country
that
and
they began
on
the
mats
those
sick
being
to carry about
to wherever
they were hearing
that
He is
And
wherever
-
He entered
into
villages
or
into
cities
or
into
fields
in
the
marketplaces
they were laying
the
ailing
and
were begging
Him
that
only
the
fringe
the
clothing
of Him
they might touch
and
as many as
-
touched
Him
were being healed
And
are gathered together
to
Him
the
Pharisees
and
some
of the
scribes
having come
from
Jerusalem
And
they had seen
some
of the
disciples
of Him
that
with defiled
hands
that
is
unwashed
are eating
the
bread
-
For
the Pharisees
and
all
the
Jews
if
not
carefully
they wash
the
hands
not
eat
holding
the
tradition
of the
elders
and
[on coming] from
the market
if
not
they wash
not
they eat
and
other things
many
there are
which
they received
[for them] to hold to
washings
of cups
and
vessels
and
utensils
And
questioned
Him
the
Pharisees
and
the
scribes
Because of
why
not
walk
the
disciples
of You
according to
the
tradition
of the
elders
but
with unwashed
hands
eat
the
bread
-
And
He said
to them
Rightly
prophesied
Isaiah
concerning
you
-
hypocrites
as
it has been written
-
This
-
people
with the
lips
Me
honors
-
but
the heart
of them
far away
is kept
from
Me
In vain
now
they worship
Me
teaching
[as] doctrines
[the] precepts
of men
Having neglected
the
commandment
-
of God
you hold
to the
tradition
-
of men
And
He was saying
to them
Neatly
do you set aside
the
commandment
-
of God
that
the
tradition
of you
you might keep
Moses
for
said
Honor
the
Father
of you
and
the
mother
of you
and
The [one]
speaking evil of
father
or
mother
in death
must end
You
however
say [that]
if
says
a man
to the
father
or
the
mother
[It is] Corban
that
is
a gift
whatever
if
from
me
you might be profited
no longer
do you allow
him
anything
to do
for the
father
or
the
mother
making void
the
word
-
of God
for the
tradition
of you
which
you have handed down
And
like [things]
such
many
you do
And
having called to [Him]
again
the
crowd
He was saying
to them
Listen to
Me
all
and
understand
Nothing
there is
from outside
the
man
entering
into
him
which
is able
to defile
him
but
the things
out of
the
man
proceeding
are
the things
defiling
the
man
And
when
He went
into
[the] house
from
the
crowd
were asking
Him
the
disciples
of Him
the
parable
And
He says
to them
Thus
also
you
without understanding
are
Not
understand you
that
everything
-
from outside
entering
into
the
man
not
is able
him
to defile
because
not
it enters
of him
into
the
heart
but
into
the
belly
and
into
the
sewer
goes out
purifying
all
the
food
He was saying
now
-
That
out of
the
man
going forth
that
defiles
the
man
Within
for
from
the
heart
-
of men
-
thoughts
-
evil
go forth
sexual immorality
thefts
murders
adulteries
covetous desires
wickednesses
deceit
sensuality
an eye
evil
slander
pride
foolishness
All
these
-
evils
from within
go forth
and
they defile
the
man
From there
also
having risen up
He went away
into
the
region
of Tyre
And
having entered
into
a house
no one
He was wishing
to know [it]
and
not
He was able
to be hidden
But
immediately
having heard
a woman
about
Him
of whom
had
the
little daughter
of her
spirit
unclean
having come
fell
at
the
feet
of Him
-
Now
the woman
was
Gentile
Syrophoenician
by
race
and
kept asking
Him
that
the
demon
He should cast forth
out of
the
daughter
of her
And
He was saying
to her
Permit
first
to be satisfied
the
children
not
for
it is
good
to take
the
bread
of the
children
and
to the
dogs
to cast [it]
-
But
she answered
and
says
to Him
Yes
Lord
even
the
dogs
under
the
table
eat
of
the
crumbs
of the
children
And
He said
to her
Because of
this
-
word
go
has gone forth
out of
the
daughter
of you
the
demon
And
having gone away
to
the
home
of her
she found
the
child
lying
on
the
bed
and
the
demon
having gone out
And
again
having departed
from
the
region
of Tyre
He came
through
Sidon
to
the
Sea
-
of Galilee
through
[the] midst
of the
region
of [the] Decapolis
And
they bring
to Him
a deaf man
and
who spoke with difficulty
and
they implore
Him
that
He might lay
on him
the
hand
And
having taken away
him
from
the
crowd
aside
privately
He put
the
fingers
of Him
to
the
ears
of him
and
having spit
He touched
the
tongue
of him
and
having looked up
to
-
heaven
He sighed deeply
and
He says
to him
Ephphatha
that
is
Be opened
And
were opened
his
-
ears
and
immediately
was loosed
the
band
of the
tongue
of him
and
he began speaking
plainly
And
He instructed
them
that
no one
they should tell
As much as
however
He
kept instructing
them
more
abundantly
they were proclaiming [it]
And
above measure
they were astonished
saying
Well
all things
He has done
both
the
deaf
He makes
to hear
and
mute
to speak
In
those
-
days
again
great
[the] crowd
being
and
not
having
what
they might eat
having called to [Him]
the
disciples
He says
to them
I am moved with compassion
upon
the
crowd
because
already
days
three
they continue
with Me
and
nothing
have
that
they might eat
And
if
I shall send away
them
hungry
to
[the] homes
of them
they will faint
on
the
way
For
some
of them
from
afar
are come
And
answered
Him
the
disciples
of Him
-
From where
these
will be able
anyone
here
to satisfy
with bread
in
this desolate place
And
He was asking
them
How many
have you
loaves
-
And
they said
Seven
And
He directs
the
crowd
to recline
on
the
ground
And
having taken
the
seven
loaves
having given thanks
He broke [them]
and
kept giving [them]
to
disciples
of Him
that
they might set before [them]
And
they set [it] before
the
crowd
And
they had
small fish
a few
And
having blessed
them
He ordered
also
these
to be set before [them]
And
they ate
and
were satisfied
And
they took up
over and above
of fragments
seven
baskets
There were
now
about
four thousand
And
He sent away
them
And
immediately
having entered
into
the
boat
with
the
disciples
of Him
He came
into
the
district
of Dalmanutha
And
went out
the
Pharisees
and
began
to dispute with
Him
seeking
from
Him
a sign
from
-
heaven
testing
Him
And
having sighed deeply
in the
spirit
of Him
He says
Why
the
generation
this
seeks
a sign
Truly
I say
to you
if
there will be given
to the
generation
this
a sign
And
having left
them
again
having embarked
He went away
to
the
other side
And
they forgot
to take
loaves
and
if
not
one
loaf
not
they had
with
them
in
the
boat
And
He was instructing
them
saying
Watch out
take heed
of
the
leaven
of the
Pharisees
and
of the
leaven
of Herod
And
they were reasoning
with
one another
because
loaves
not
they have
And
having known [it]
He says
to them
Why
reason you
because
loaves
not
you have
Not yet
do you perceive
nor
understand
Hardened
do you have
the
heart
of you
Eyes
having
not
do you see
And
ears
having
not
do you hear
And
not
do you remember
When
the
five
loaves
I broke
for
the
five thousand
how many
hand-baskets
of fragments
full
took you up
They say
to Him
Twelve
When
the
seven
to
the
four thousand
of how many
baskets
[the] fillings
of fragments
took you up
And
said
Seven
And
He was saying
to them
Not yet
do you understand
And
they come
to
Bethsaida
And
they bring
to Him
a blind [man]
and
implore
Him
that
him
He might touch
And
having taken hold of
the
hand
of the
blind [man]
He led forth
him
out
of the
village
and
having spit
upon
the
eyes
of him
having laid
the
hands
upon him
He was asking
him
if
anything
you see
And
having looked up
he was saying
I see
the
men
for
as
trees
I see [them]
walking
Then
again
He laid
the
hands
upon
the
eyes
of him
and
he opened his eyes
and
he was restored
and
he began to see
clearly
everything
And
He sent
him
to
[the] home
of him
saying
Not
into
the
village
may you enter
And
went forth
-
Jesus
and
the
disciples
of Him
into
the
villages
of Caesarea
-
Philippi
And
on
the
way
He was questioning
the
disciples
of Him
saying
to them
Whom
Me
do pronounce
-
men
to be
-
And
they answered
Him
saying
-
John
the
Baptist
and
others
Elijah
others
now
-
one
of the
prophets
And
He
was questioning
them
You
however
whom
Me
do pronounce
to be
Answering
-
Peter
says
to Him
You
are
the
Christ
And
He warned
them
that
no one
they should tell
concerning
Him
And
He began
to teach
them
that
it is necessary for
the
Son
-
of Man
many things
to suffer
and
to be rejected
by
the
elders
and
the
chief priests
and
the
scribes
and
to be killed
and
after
three
days
to rise [again]
And
openly
the
word
He was speaking
And
having taken Him
-
Peter
to him
he began
to rebuke
Him
-
And
having turned
and
having looked upon
the
disciples
of Him
He rebuked
Peter
and
said
Get
behind
Me
Satan
for
not
you have in mind
the
things
of God
but
the
things
of men
And
having called to [Him]
the
crowd
with
the
disciples
of Him
He said
to them
If
anyone
desires
after
Me
to come
let him deny
himself
and
let him take up
the
cross
of him
and
let him follow
Me
Whoever
for
if
might desire
-
life
his
to save
will lose
it
whoever
now
-
will lose
the
life
of him
on account of
Me
and
of the
gospel
he will save
it
What
for
does it profit
a man
to gain
the
world
whole
and
to lose
the
soul
of him
What
for
shall give
a man
[as] an exchange
for the
soul
of him
Whoever
for
if
may be ashamed of
Me
and
-
My
words
in
the
generation
this
-
adulterous
and
sinful
also
the
Son
-
of Man
will be ashamed of
him
when
He shall come
in
the
glory
of the
Father
of Him
with
the
angels
-
holy
And
He was saying
to them
Truly
I say
to you
that
there are
some
here
of those
standing
who
no
not
shall taste
of death
until
-
they see
the
kingdom
-
of God
having come
with
power
And
after
days
six
takes along
-
Jesus
-
Peter
and
-
James
and
John
and
brings up
them
into
a mountain
high
apart
themselves
alone
And
He was transfigured
before
them
and
the
garments
of Him
became
shining
white
exceedingly
such as
a launderer
on
the
earth
not
is able
thus
to whiten
And
appeared
to them
Elijah
with
Moses
and
they were
talking with
-
Jesus
And
answering
-
Peter
says
-
to Jesus
Rabbi
good
it is
for us
here
to be
And
let us make
three
tabernacles
for You
one
and
for Moses
one
and
for Elijah
one
Not
for
he knew
what
he should say
terrified
for
they were
And
there came
a cloud
overshadowing
them
and
there came
a voice
out of
the
cloud
This
is
the
Son
of Me
the
beloved
listen you
to Him
And
suddenly
having looked around
no longer
no one
they saw
except
-
Jesus
alone
with
them
And
descending
of them
from
the
mountain
He instructed
them
that
to no one
what
they had seen
they should tell
if
not
until
the
Son
-
of Man
out from
[the] dead
had risen
And
that
saying
they kept
among
themselves
questioning
what
it is
-
out from
the dead
to rise
And
they were asking
Him
saying
-
Say
the
scribes
that
Elijah
it behooves
to come
first
-
And
He was saying
to them
Elijah
indeed
having come
first
restores
all things
and
how
has it been written
of
the
Son
-
of Man
that
many things
He should suffer
and
be set at naught
But
I say
to you
that
also
Elijah
has come
and
they did
to him
whatever
they desired
as
it has been written
of
him
And
having come
to
the
disciples
they saw
a crowd
great
around
them
and
scribes
arguing
with
them
And
immediately
all
the
crowd
having seen
Him
were greatly amazed
and
running to [Him]
were greeting
Him
And
He asked
them
What
are you disputing
with
them
And
answered
Him
one
out of
the
crowd
Teacher
I brought
the
son
of me
to
You
having
a spirit
mute
and
whenever
if
him
it seizes
it throws down
him
and
he foams
and
gnashes
-
his teeth
and
is withering away
And
I spoke
to the
disciples
of You
that
it
they might cast out
and
not
they had power
-
And
answering
him
He says
O
generation
unbelieving
Until
when
with
you
will I be
Until
when
will I bear with
you
Bring
him
to
Me
And
they brought
him
to
Him
And
having seen
Him
the
spirit
immediately
threw into convulsions
him
and
having fallen
upon
the
ground
he began rolling around
foaming
And
He asked
the
father
of him
How long
a time
is it
that
this
has been
with him
-
And
he said
From
childhood
And
often
both
into
fire
him
it casts
and
into
waters
that
it might destroy
him
But
if
anything
You are able [to do]
help
us
having compassion
on
us
-
And
Jesus
said
to him
-
If
You are able
All things
are possible
to the [one]
believing
Immediately
having cried out
the
father
of the
child
was saying
I believe
help
of me
the
unbelief
Having seen
now
-
Jesus
that
was running together
a crowd
He rebuked
the
spirit
-
unclean
saying
to it
-
Mute
and
deaf
spirit
I
command
you
come
out of
him
and
no more
may you enter
into
him
And
having cried out
and
much
having thrown him into convulsions
it came out
and
he became
as if
dead
in order for
-
many
to say
that
he was dead
-
And
Jesus
having taken
by the
hand
him
raised up
him
and
he arose
And
having entered
He
into
a house
the
disciples
of Him
in
private
were asking
Him
Why
we
not
were able
to cast out
it
And
He said
to them
This
-
kind
by
nothing
is able
to go out
if
not
by
prayer
From there
having gone forth
they were passing
through
-
Galilee
and
not
did He want
that
anyone
should know [it]
He was teaching
for
the
disciples
of Him
and
He was saying
to them
-
The
Son
-
of Man
is delivered
into [the]
hands
of men
and
they will kill
Him
and
having been killed
on the
third
day
He will arise
-
And
they did not understand
the
saying
and
they were afraid
Him
to ask
And
they came
to
Capernaum
And
in
the
house
having been
He was asking
them
What
on
the
way
were you discussing
-
And
they were silent
with
one another
for
they had been discussing
along
the
road
which [was]
greatest
And
having sat down
He called
the
Twelve
and
He says
to them
If
anyone
desires
first
to be
he will be
of all
last
and
of all
servant
And
having taken
a child
He set
it
in
midst
of them
and
having taken in [His] arms
it
He said
to them
Whoever
-
one
-
of such
little children
shall receive
in
the
name
of Me
Me
receives
and
whoever
-
Me
shall receive
not
Me
receives
but
the [One]
having sent
Me
Answered
Him
-
John
Teacher
we saw
someone
in
the
name
of You
casting out
demons
who
not
does follow
us
and
we were forbidding
him
because
not
he was following
us
-
And
Jesus
said
Not
forbid
him
No one
for
there is
who
will do
a work of power
in
the
name
of Me
and
will be able
readily
to speak evil of
Me
Whoever
for
not
is
against
us
for
us
is
Whoever
for
-
might give to drink
you
a cup
of water
in
name
because
Christâs
you are
truly
I say
to you
that
no
not
shall he lose
the
reward
of him
And
whoever
-
might cause to stumble
one
of the
little ones
these
-
believing
better
it is
for him
rather
if
is put
a millstone
heavy
around
the
neck
of him
and
he has been cast
into
the
sea
And
if
should cause to stumble
you
the
hand
of you
cut off
it
better
it is
for you
crippled
to enter
into
-
life
than
-
two
hands
having
to go away
into
-
hell
into
the
fire
-
unquenchable
And
if
the
foot
of you
should cause to stumble
you
cut off
it
better
it is
for you
to enter
into
-
life
lame
than
the
two
feet
having
to be cast
into
-
hell
And
if
the
eye
of you
should cause to stumble
you
cast out
it
better
for you
it is
with one eye
to enter
into
the
kingdom
-
of God
than
two
eyes
having
to be cast
into
-
hell
where
the
worm
of them
not
dies
and
the
fire
not
is quenched
Everyone
for
with fire
will be salted
Good [is]
the
salt
if
however
the
salt
unsalty
becomes
with
what
it
will you season
Have
in
yourselves
salt
and
be at peace
with
one another
And
from there
having risen up
He comes
into
the
region
-
of Judea
and
beyond
the
Jordan
And
come together
again
crowds
to
Him
and
as
He had been accustomed
again
He was teaching
them
And
having come to [him]
the Pharisees
were demanding
of Him
if
it is lawful
for a husband
a wife
to divorce
testing
Him
-
And
He answering
said
to them
What
you
did command
Moses
-
And
they said
Permitted
Moses
a roll
of divorce
to write
and
to send [her] away
-
But
Jesus
said
to them
Because of
the
hardness of heart
of you
He wrote
for you
the
commandment
this
From
however
[the] beginning
of creation
Male
and
female
He made
them
On account of
this
will leave
a man
the
father
of him
and
-
mother
and
will be
the
two
for
flesh
one
Therefore
no longer
they are
two
but
one
flesh
What
therefore
-
God
has joined together
man
not
let separate
And
in
the
house
again
the
disciples
concerning
this
were asking
Him
And
He says
to them
Whoever
-
shall divorce
the
wife
of him
and
shall marry
another
commits adultery
against
her
And
if
a woman
having divorced
the
husband
of her
should marry
another
she commits adultery
And
they were bringing
to Him
little children
that
them
He might touch
-
But
the disciples
rebuked
them
Having seen
now
-
Jesus
was indignant
and
said
to them
Permit
the
little children
to come
to
Me
not
do hinder
them
To the
for
such
belongs
the
kingdom
-
of God
Truly
I say
to you
whoever
-
not
shall receive
the
kingdom
-
of God
as
a child
no
not
shall enter
into
it
And
having taken [them] in arms
them
He was blessing
having laid
the
hands
on
them
And
going forth
of Him
on
[the] journey
having run up
one
and
having knelt down to
Him
was asking
Him
Teacher
good
what
shall I do
that
life
eternal
I might inherit
-
And
Jesus
said
to him
Why
Me
call you
good
No one [is]
good
if
not
alone
-
God
The
commandments
you know
Not
shall you murder
not
shall you commit adultery
not
shall you steal
not
shall you bear false witness
not
shall you defraud
you shall honor
the
father
of you
and
the
mother
-
And
he was saying
to Him
Teacher
these
all
I have kept
from
[the] youth
of me
-
And
Jesus
having looked upon
him
loved
him
and
said
to him
One thing
to you
is lacking
Go
as much as
you have
sell
and
give
to the
poor
and
you will have
treasure
in
heaven
and
come
follow
Me
-
And
having been sad
at
the
word
he went away
grieving
he was [one]
for
having
possessions
many
And
having looked around
-
Jesus
says
the
disciples
of Him
How
difficultly
those
-
riches
having
into
the
kingdom
-
of God
will enter
-
And
the disciples
were astonished
at
the
words
of Him
-
But
Jesus
again
answering
says
to them
Children
how
difficult
it is
into
the
kingdom
-
of God
to enter
Easier
it is
[for] a camel
through
the
eye
of the
needle
to pass
than [for]
a rich man
into
the
kingdom
-
of God
to enter
-
And
exceedingly
they were astonished
saying
among
themselves
Then
who
is able
to be saved
Having looked on
them
-
Jesus
says
With
men
[it is] impossible
but
not
with
God
all things
for
[are] possible
with
-
God
Began
to say
-
Peter
to Him
Behold
we
have left
all
and
followed
You
Was saying
-
Jesus
Truly
I say
to you
no one
there is
who
has left
house
or
brothers
or
sisters
or
mother
or
father
or
children
or
lands
for the sake
of me
and
because
of the
gospel
if
not
shall take
a hundredfold
now
in
the
time
this
houses
and
brothers
and
sisters
and
mothers
and
children
and
lands
with
persecutions
and
in
the
age
which
is coming
life
eternal
Many
however
will be
first
last
and
the
last
first
They were
then
on
the
way
going up
to
Jerusalem
and
was
going on before
them
-
Jesus
and
they were astonished
those
then
following
were afraid
And
having taken to [Him]
again
the
Twelve
He began
them
to tell
the things
being about
to Him
to happen
-
Behold
we go up
to
Jerusalem
and
the
Son
-
of Man
will be betrayed
to the
chief priests
and
to the
scribes
and
they will condemn
Him
to death
and
will betray
Him
to the
Gentiles
And
they will mock
Him
and
will spit upon
Him
and
will flog
Him
and
will kill
and
on the
third
day
He will rise again
And
come up
to Him
James
and
John
the
sons
of Zebedee
saying to
Him
Teacher
we desire
that
whatever
if
we might ask
you
You would do
for us
-
And
He said
to them
What
do you desire
Me
to do
for you
-
And
they said
to Him
Grant
to us
that
one
of [us]
at
[Your] right hand
and
one
at
[Your] left hand
we might sit
in
the
glory
of You
-
And
Jesus
said
to them
Not
you know
what
you ask
Are you able
to drink
the
cup
which
I
drink
and
the
baptism
which
I
am baptized
to be baptized [with]
-
And
they said
to Him
We are able
-
And
Jesus
said
to them
The
cup
which
I
drink
you will drink
and
the
baptism
which
I
am baptized
you will be baptized [with]
-
but
to sit
at
[the] right hand
of Me
or
at
[the] left hand
not
is
Mine
to give
but [to those]
for whom
it has been prepared
And
having heard [this]
the
ten
began
to be indignant
about
James
and
John
And
having called near
them
-
Jesus
says
to them
You know
that
those
being accounted
to rule over
the
Gentiles
exercise lordship over
them
and
those
great ones
of them
exercise authority over
them
Not
thus
however
shall it be
among
you
Instead
whoever
-
desires
great
to become
among
you
will be
your
servant
and
whoever
-
desires
among
you
to become
first
will be
of all
slave
Even
for
the
Son
-
of Man
not
came
to be served
but
to serve
and
to give
the
life
of Him
[as] a ransom
for
many
And
they come
to
Jericho
And
as was going out
He
from
Jericho
and
the
disciples
of Him
and
a crowd
large
the
son
of Timaeus
Bartimaeus
blind
beggar
was sitting
beside
the
road
And
having heard
that
Jesus
of
Nazareth
it is
he began
to cry out
and
to say
Son
of David
Jesus
have mercy on
me
And
were rebuking
him
many
that
he should be silent
-
but
much
more
he kept crying out
Son
of David
have mercy on
me
And
having stopped
-
Jesus
commanded
to be called
him
And
they call
the
blind [man]
saying
to him
Take courage
Rise up
He calls
you
-
And
having cast away
the
cloak
of him
having risen up
he came
to
-
Jesus
And
answering
him
-
Jesus
says
What
to you
do you desire
I should do
-
And
the blind [man]
said
to Him
Rabboni
that
I may receive sight
And
-
Jesus
said
to him
Go
the
faith
of you
has healed
you
And
immediately
he received sight
and
he began following
Him
on
the
way
And
when
they drew near
to
Jerusalem
to
Bethphage
and
Bethany
near
the
Mount
-
of Olives
He sends
two
of the
disciples
of Him
and
says
to them
Go
into
the
village
-
before
you
and
immediately
entering
into
it
you will find
a colt
having been tied
upon
which
no one
not yet
of men
has sat
having untied
it
also
bring [it]
And
if
anyone
to you
says
Why
are you doing
this
say
the
Lord
of it
need
has
and
soon
it
He will send
back
here
And
they departed
and
found
the colt
having been tied
at
the door
outside
by
the
street
and
they untied
it
And
some
of those
there
standing
were saying
to them
What
are you doing
untying
the
colt
-
And
they spoke
to them
as
had commanded
-
Jesus
and
they allowed
them
And
they led
the
colt
to
-
Jesus
and
they cast upon
it
the
cloaks
of them
and
He sat
on
it
And
many
the
cloaks
of them
spread
on
the
road
others
then
branches
having been cut down
from
the
fields
And
those
going before
and
those
following
were crying out
Hosanna
Blessed is
the [One]
coming
in [the]
name
of [the] Lord
Blessed
[is] the
coming
kingdom
of the
father
of us
David
Hosanna
in
the
highest
And
He entered
into
Jerusalem
into
the
temple
and
having looked around on
all things
late
already
being
the
hour
He went out
to
Bethany
with
the
Twelve
And
on the
next day
having gone out
they
from
Bethany
He was hungry
And
having seen
a fig tree
from
afar
having
leaves
He went
if
perhaps
anything
He will find
on
it
And
having come
to
it
nothing
He found
if
not
leaves
the
for
season
not
it was
of figs
And
answering
He said
to it
No more
to
the
age
of
you
no one
fruit
may eat
And
were listening
the
disciples
of Him
And
they come
to
Jerusalem
And
having entered
into
the
temple
He began
to cast out
those
selling
and
those
buying
in
the
temple
and
the
tables
of the
money changers
and
the
seats
of those
selling
the
doves
He overturned
And
not
He would permit
that
anyone
should carry
a vessel
through
the
temple
And
He began teaching
and
was saying
to them
Not
has it been written
-
The
house
of Me
a house
of prayer
will be called
for all
the
nations
You
however
have made
it
a den
of robbers
And
heard [it]
the
chief priests
and
the
scribes
and
they were seeking
how
Him
they might destroy
they were afraid of
for
Him
all
for
the
crowd
was astonished
at
the
teaching
of Him
And
when
evening
came
they were going forth
out of
the
city
And
passing by
in the morning
they saw
the
fig tree
having been dried up
from [the]
roots
And
having remembered
-
Peter
says
to Him
Rabbi
look
the
fig tree
that
You cursed
is dried up
And
answering
-
Jesus
says
to them
Have
faith
from God
Truly
I say
to you
that
whoever
-
shall say
to the
mountain
this
Be you taken away
and
be you cast
into
the
sea
and
not
shall doubt
in
the
heart
of him
but
shall believe
that
what
he says
takes place
it will be done
for him
Because of
this
I say
to you
all things
whatever
praying
also
you ask
believe
that
you receive
and
it will be
to you
And
when
you may stand
praying
forgive
if
anything
you have
against
anyone
so that
also
the
Father
of you
who [is]
in
the
heavens
might forgive
you
the
trespasses
of you
And
they come
again
to
Jerusalem
And
in
the
temple
is walking
as He
come
to
Him
the
chief priests
and
the
scribes
and
the
elders
And
they were saying
to Him
By
what
authority
these things
are You doing
Or
who
You
gave
the
authority
this
that
these things
You should do
-
And
Jesus
said
to them
I will ask
you
one
question
and
you answer
Me
and
I will tell
you
by
what
authority
these things
I do
The
baptism
-
of John
from
heaven
was it
or
from
men
Answer
Me
And
they began reasoning
with
themselves
saying
If
we should say
From
heaven
He will say
Because of
why
then
not
did you believe
him
But
should we say
From
men
they were afraid of
the
people
all
for
were holding
-
John
truly
that
a prophet
he was
And
answering
-
to Jesus
they say
Not
do we know
And
-
Jesus
says
to them
Neither
I
tell
you
by
what
authority
these things
I do
And
He began
to them
in
parables
to speak
A vineyard
a man
planted
and
he placed around [it]
a fence
and
dug
a wine vat
and
built
a tower
and
rented out
it
to farmers
and
traveled abroad
And
he sent
to
the
farmers
at the
due time
a servant
that
from
the
farmers
he might receive
from
the
fruit
of the
vineyard
But
having taken
him
they beat [him]
and
sent [him] away
empty-handed
And
again
he sent
to
them
another
servant
and him
they struck on the head
and
treated shamefully
And
another
He sent
and him
they killed
also
many
others
some
indeed
beating
some
then
killing
Yet
one
having
son
beloved
he sent
him
last
to
them
saying
-
They will have respect for
the
son
of me
Those
however
-
farmers
to
themselves
said
-
This
is
the
heir
come
let us kill
him
and
ours
will be
the
inheritance
And
having taken
they killed
him
and
cast forth
him
outside
the
vineyard
What
will do
the
master
of the
vineyard
He will come
and
will destroy
the
farmers
and
will give
the
vineyard
to others
Not even
the
Scripture
this
have you read
[The] stone
which
rejected
those
building
this
has become
the
chief
corner
from [the]
Lord
was
this
and
it is
marvelous
in
[the] eyes
of us
And
they were seeking
Him
to lay hold of
and
they feared
the
crowd
they knew
for
that
against
them
the
parable
He had spoken
And
having left
Him
they went away
And
they send
to
Him
some
of the
Pharisees
and
of the
Herodians
that
Him
they might catch
in discourse
And
having come
they say
to Him
Teacher
we know
that
true
You are
and
not
there is care
to You
about
no one
not
for
You look
on [the]
appearance
of men
but
on the basis of
[the] truth
the
way
-
of God
teach
Is it lawful
to give
tribute
to Caesar
or
not
Should we pay
or
not
pay
-
And
knowing
of them
the
hypocrisy
He said
to them
Why
Me
do you test
Bring
Me
a denarius
that
I might see [it]
-
And
they brought [it]
And
He says
to them
Whose [is]
the
likeness
this
and
the
inscription
-
And
they said
to Him
Caesarâs
-
And
Jesus
said
to them
The things
of Caesar
give back
to Caesar
and
the things
-
of God
-
to God
And
they were amazed
at
Him
And
come
Sadducees
to
Him
who
say
a resurrection
not
there is
and
they began questioning
Him
saying
Teacher
Moses
wrote
for us
that
if
of anyone
a brother
should die
and
leave behind
a wife
and
not
leave
children
that
should take
the
brother
of him
the
wife
and
raise up
seed
for the
brother
of him
Seven
brothers
there were
and
the
first
took
a wife
and
dying
not
left
seed
And
the
second
took
her
and
died
not
having left
seed
and
the
third
likewise
And
the
seven
not
left
seed
Last
of all
also
the
woman
died
In
the
resurrection
when
they rise
of which
of them
will she be
wife
-
For
the seven
had
her
as wife
Was saying
to them
-
Jesus
Not
because of
this
do you err
not
knowing
the
Scriptures
nor
the
power
-
of God
When
for
out from
[the] dead
they rise
neither
do they marry
nor
are given in marriage
but
are
like
angels
in
the
heavens
Concerning
now
the
dead
that
they rise
not
have you read
in
the
book
of Moses
on
the
bush
how
spoke
to him
-
God
saying
I [am]
the
God
of Abraham
and
God
of Isaac
and
God
of Jacob
Not
He is
God
of [the] dead
but
of [the] living
Greatly
you err
And
having come up
one
of the
scribes
having heard
them
reasoning together
having seen
that
well
He answered
them
he questioned
Him
Which
is
commandment
[the] first
of all
Answered
-
Jesus
The
foremost
is
Hear this
O Israel
[The] Lord
-
God
of us
[the] Lord
One
is
and
you shall love
[the] Lord
-
God
of you
with
all
the
heart
of you
and
with
all
the
soul
of you
and
with
all
the
mind
of you
and
with
all
the
strength
of you
[The] second
this
You shall love
the
neighbor
of you
as
yourself
Greater
than these
another
commandment
not
there is
And
said
to Him
the
scribe
Right
Teacher
according to
truth
You have spoken
that
One
He is
and
not
there is
another
besides
Him
and
-
to love
Him
with
all
the
heart
and
with
all
the
understanding
and
with
all
the
strength
and
-
to love
the
neighbor
as
oneself
more important
is
than all
the
burnt offerings
and
sacrifices
And
-
Jesus
having seen
him
that
wisely
he answered
said
to him
Not
far
are you
from
the
kingdom
-
of God
And
no one
no longer
dared
Him
to question
And
answering
-
Jesus
was saying
teaching
in
the
temple
How
say
the
scribes
that
the
Christ
[the] son
of David
is
Himself
David
said
by
the
Spirit
-
Holy
Said
[the] Lord
to the
Lord
of me
Sit
at
[the] right hand
of Me
until
-
I place
of the
enemies
of You
[as] a footstool
of the
feet
of You
Himself
David
calls
Him
Lord
then
how
of him
is He
son
And
the
great
crowd
was listening
to Him
gladly
And
in
the
teaching
of Him
He was saying
Beware
of
the
scribes
-
desiring
in
robes
to walk about
and
greetings
in
the
marketplaces
and
first seats
in
the
synagogues
and
first places
at
the
feasts
those
devouring
the
houses
of the
widows
and
as a pretext
at great length
praying
These
will receive
greater
judgment
And
having sat down
opposite
the
treasury
He was watching
how
the
crowd
cast
money
into
the
treasury
and
many
rich
were casting [in]
much
And
having come
one
widow
poor
cast [in]
lepta
two
which
is
a kodrantes
And
having called to [Him]
the
disciples
of Him
He says
to them
Truly
I say
to you
that
the
widow
this
-
poor
more
than all
has cast [in]
of those
casting
into
the
treasury
All
for
out of
that which
was abounding
to them
cast [in]
she
however
out of
the
poverty
of her
all
as much as
she had
cast [in]
all
the
livelihood
of her
And
going forth
of Him
out of
the
temple
says
to Him
one
of the
disciples
of Him
Teacher
behold
what
stones
and
what
buildings
And
-
Jesus
said
to him
See you
these
-
great
buildings
No
not
shall be left
stone
upon
stone
which
no
not
shall be thrown down
And
sitting
of Him
upon
the
Mount
-
of Olives
opposite
the
temple
asked
Him
in
private
Peter
and
James
and
John
and
Andrew
Tell
us
when
these things
will be
And
what [will be]
the
sign
when
are going
these things
to be accomplished
all
-
And
Jesus
began
to say
to them
Take heed
lest
anyone
you
mislead
Many
will come
in
the
name
of Me
saying
-
I
am [He]
and
many
they will mislead
When
then
you shall hear of
wars
and
rumors
of wars
not
be disturbed
it must
come to pass
but
not yet [is]
the
end
Will rise up
for
nation
against
nation
and
kingdom
against
kingdom
There will be
earthquakes
throughout
places
there will be
famines
[The] beginning
of birth pains [are]
these
Take heed
however
you
to yourselves
they will betray
you
to
courts
and
in
synagogues
you will be beaten
and
before
governors
and
kings
you will stand
because
of Me
for
a testimony
to them
And
to
all
the
nations
first
it behooves
to proclaim
the
gospel
And
when
they might lead away
you
delivering [you] up
not
be anxious beforehand
what
you should say
but
whatever
if
might be given
to you
in
that
-
hour
that
speak
not
for
are
you
those
speaking
but
the
Spirit
-
Holy
And
will deliver up
brother
brother
to
death
and
father
child
and
will rise up
children
against
parents
and
will put to death
them
And
you will be
hated
by
all
on account of
the
name
of Me
the [one]
however
having endured
to
[the] end
he
will be saved
When
then
you see
the
abomination
of the
desolation
standing
where
not
it should
the [one]
reading
let him understand
then
those
in
-
Judea
let them flee
to
the
mountains
the [one]
upon
the
housetop
not
let him come down
nor
go in
anything
to take
out of
the
house
of him
and
the [one]
in
the
field
not
let him return
to
the things
behind
to take
the
clothing
of him
Woe
then
to those
in
womb
having
and
to the [ones]
nursing infants
in
those
-
days
Pray
then
that it
not
might be
in winter
will be [in]
for
the
days
those
tribulation
such as
never
has been
the like
from [the]
beginning
of creation
which
created
-
God
until
-
now
and
never
not
shall be
And
if
not
had shortened
[the] Lord
the
days
no
-
there would have been saved
any
flesh
but
on account of
the
elect
whom
He chose
He has shortened
the
days
And
then
if
anyone
to you
says
Behold
here [is]
the
Christ
Behold
there
not
you shall believe [it]
There will arise
for
false Christs
and
false prophets
and
will give
signs
and
wonders
so as
-
to deceive
if
possible
the
elect
You
however
take heed
I have foretold
to you
all things
But
in
those
-
days
after
the
tribulation
those
The
sun
will be darkened
and
the
moon
not
will give
the
light
of it
and
the
stars
will be
out of
the
heaven
falling
and
the
powers
that [are]
in
the
heavens
will be shaken
And
then
will they see
the
Son
-
of Man
coming
in
[the] clouds
with
power
great
and
glory
And
then
He will send
the
angels
and
will gather together
the
elect
of Him
from
the
four
winds
from [the]
end
of earth
to [the]
end
of heaven
Of
now
the
fig tree
learn
the
parable
When
already
the
branch
of it
tender
has become
and
it puts forth
the
leaves
you know
that
near
the
summer
is
So
also
you
when
you see
these things
coming to pass
know
that
near
He is
at [the]
doors
Truly
I say
to you
that
no
not
will have passed away
the
generation
this
until
that
these things
all
shall have taken place
The
heaven
and
the
earth
will pass away
-
but
the words
of Me
in no way
will pass away
Concerning
now
the
day
that
or
the
hour
no one
knows
not even
the
angels
in
heaven
nor
the
Son
if
not
the
Father
Take heed
watch
not
you know
for
when
the
time
is
[It is] like
a man
going on a journey
having left
the
house
of him
and
having given
the
servants
of him
-
authority
to each one
the
work
of him
And
the
doorkeeper
he commanded
that
he should keep watch
Watch
therefore
not
you know
for
when
the
master
of the
house
comes
or
at evening
or
at midnight
or
when the rooster crows
or
morning
lest
having come
suddenly
he should find
you
sleeping
What
now
to you
I say
to all
I say
Watch
It would be
now
the
Passover
and
the
[Feast of] Unleavened Bread
after
two
days
And
were seeking
the
chief priests
and
the
scribes
how
Him
by
stealth
having taken
they might kill [Him]
They were saying
for
Not
during
the
feast
lest
ever
there will be
an uproar
of the
people
And
being
of Him
in
Bethany
in
the
house
of Simon
the
leper
having reclined
of Him
came
a woman
having
an alabaster flask
of fragrant oil
of nard
pure
of great price
having broken
the
alabaster flask
she poured [it] on
His
-
head
Were
now
some
indignant
within
themselves
To
what
the
waste
this
of the
fragrant oil
has been made
Could
for
this
-
fragrant oil
to have been sold
for above
denarii
three hundred
and
to have been given
to the
poor
And
they were grumbling
at her
-
And
Jesus
said
Leave alone
her
why
to her
trouble
do you cause
A good
work
she did
toward
Me
Always
for
the
poor
you have
with
you
and
whenever
you desire
you are able
them
good
to do
Me
however
not
always
do you have
What
she could
she did
She came beforehand
to anoint
the
body
of Me
for
the
burial
Truly
now
I say
to you
wherever
if
shall be proclaimed
the
gospel
in
whole
the
world
also
what
has done
this [woman]
will be spoken of
for
a memorial
of her
And
Judas
Iscariot
-
one
of the
Twelve
went away
to
the
chief priests
that
Him
he might betray
to them
-
And
having heard
they rejoiced
and
promised
him
money
to give
And
he was seeking
how
Him
conveniently
he might deliver up
And
on the
first
day
-
of unleavened [bread]
when
the
Passover lamb
they were to sacrifice
say
to Him
the
disciples
of Him
Where
do You desire [that]
having gone
we should prepare
that
You may eat
the
Passover
And
He sends forth
two
of the
disciples
of Him
and
says
to them
Go
into
the
city
and
will meet
you
a man
a pitcher
of water
carrying
Follow
him
And
wherever
if
he might enter
say
to the
master of the house
that
the
Teacher
says
Where
is
the
guest room
of Me
where
the
Passover
with
the
disciples
of Me
I may eat
And
he
you
will show
an upper room
large
having been furnished
[and] ready
And
there
prepare
for us
And
went away
-
his disciples
and
came
into
the
city
and
found
as
He had said
to them
and
they prepared
the
Passover
And
evening
having arrived
He comes
with
the
Twelve
And
as were reclining
they
and
were eating
-
Jesus
said
Truly
I say
to you
that
one
of
you
will betray
Me
who
is eating
with
Me
They began
to be grieved
and
to say
to Him
one
by
one
Surely not
I
-
And
He said
to them
[It is] one of
the
Twelve
who
is dipping
with
Me
in
the
bowl
For
-
indeed
the Son
-
of Man
goes
as
it has been written
concerning
Him
woe
however
to the
man
that
by
whom
the
Son
-
of Man
is betrayed
better
for him [it were]
if
not
had been born
the
man
that
And
they were eating
of them
having taken
bread
having spoken a blessing
He broke
and
gave
to them
and
said
Take
this
is
the
body
of Me
And
having taken
the cup
having given thanks
He gave [it]
to them
and
they drank
of
it
all
And
He said
to them
This
is
the
blood
of Me
of the
covenant
which
is being poured out
for
many
Truly
I say
to you
that
no more
never
not
will I drink
of
the
fruit
of the
vine
until
the
day
that
when
it
I drink
anew
in
the
kingdom
-
of God
And
having sung a hymn
they went out
to
the
Mount
-
of Olives
And
says
to them
-
Jesus
-
All
you will fall away
for
it has been written
I will strike
the
shepherd
and
the
sheep
will be scattered
But
after
-
having arisen
I
will go before
you
into
-
Galilee
-
And
Peter
was saying
to Him
If
even
all
will fall away
yet
not
I
And
says
to him
-
Jesus
Truly
I say
to you
that
yourself
now
this
-
night
before
that
twice
[the] rooster
crows
three times
Me
you will deny
-
And
emphatically
he kept saying
If
it is needful
of me
to die with
You
no
not
You
will I deny
Likewise
now
also
all
of them were saying
And
they come
to
a place
of which
the
name [is]
Gethsemane
and
He says
to the
disciples
of Him
Sit
here
while
I shall pray
And
He takes
-
Peter
and
-
James
and
-
John
with
Him
and
He began
to be greatly awe-struck
and
deeply distressed
And
He says
to them
Very sorrowful
is
the
soul
of Me
even to
death
remain
here
and
watch
And
having gone forward
a little
He fell
upon
the
ground
and
was praying
that
if
possible
it is
might pass
from
Him
the
hour
And
He was saying
Abba
-
Father
all things [are]
possible
to You
take away
the
cup
this
from
Me
but
not
what
I
will
but
what
You
And
He comes
and
finds
them
sleeping
And
He says
-
to Peter
Simon
are you asleep
Not
were you able
one
hour
to watch
Watch
and
pray
so that
not
you may enter
into
temptation
The
indeed
spirit
[is] willing
-
but
the flesh
weak
And
again
having gone away
He prayed
the
same
thing
having said
And
again
having returned
he found
them
sleeping
Were
for
of them
the
eyes
heavy
and
not
they knew
what
they should answer
Him
And
He comes
the
third time
and
says
to them
Are you sleeping
-
still
and
taking your rest
It is enough
has come
the
hour
behold
is delivered up
the
Son
-
of Man
into
the
hands
of the
sinful
Rise
let us go
behold
the [one]
betraying
Me
has drawn near
And
immediately
while yet
of Him
speaking
comes up
-
Judas
one
of the
Twelve
and
with
Him
a crowd
with
swords
and
clubs
from
the
chief priests
and
the
scribes
and
the
elders
Had given
then
the [one]
delivering up
Him
a sign
to them
saying
Whomever
-
I shall kiss
He
is
seize
Him
and
lead [Him] away
securely
And
having arrived
immediately
having come up
to Him
he says
Rabbi
And
he kissed
Him
-
And
they laid
the
hands
on Him
and
seized
Him
One
then
a certain
of those
standing by
having drawn
the
sword
struck
the
servant
of the
high priest
and
cut off
of him
the
ear
And
answering
-
Jesus
said
to them
As
against
a robber
are you come out
with
swords
and
clubs
to capture
Me
Every
day
I was
with
you
in
the
temple
teaching
and
not
you did seize
Me
But [it is]
that
may be fulfilled
the
Scriptures
And
having left
Him
fled
all
And
[a] young man
certain
was following
Him
having cast
a linen cloth
about
[his] naked [body]
and
they seize
him
-
and
having left behind
the
linen cloth
naked
he fled
And
they led away
-
Jesus
to
the
high priest
And
come together
all
the
chief priests
and
the
elders
and
the
scribes
And
-
Peter
from
afar off
followed
Him
as far as
within
to
the
court
of the
high priest
and
he was
sitting
with
the
officers
and
warming himself
at
the
fire
-
And
the chief priests
and
all
the
Council
were seeking
against
-
Jesus
testimony
to
-
put to death
Him
but
not
they were finding [any]
Many
for
were bearing false testimony
against
Him
but
alike
their
testimonies
not
were
And
some
having risen up
were bearing false testimony
against
Him
saying
-
We
heard
Him
saying
-
I
will destroy
the
temple
this
the [one]
made with hands
and
in
three
days
another
not made with hands
I will build
And
neither
thus
alike
was
the
testimony
of them
And
having stood up
the
high priest
in
the midst
he questioned
-
Jesus
saying
Not
answer You
nothing
What [is it]
these
You
testify against
-
But
He was silent
and
not
did He answer
nothing
Again
the
high priest
was questioning
Him
and
says
to Him
You
are
the
Christ
the
Son
of the
Blessed [One]
-
And
Jesus
said
I
am
And
you will see
the
Son
-
of Man
at [the]
right hand
sitting
of
Power
and
coming
with
the
clouds
of
heaven
-
And
the high priest
having torn
the
garments
of him
says
What
any more
need
have we
of witnesses
You heard
the
blasphemy
What
to you
does it appear
-
And
all
condemned
Him
deserving
to be
of death
And
began
some
to spit upon
Him
and
to cover up
of Him
the
face
and
to strike
Him
and
to say
to Him
Prophesy
And
the
officers
with the palms
Him
received
And
being
-
Peter
below
in
the
courtyard
comes
one
of the
servant girls
of the
high priest
and
having seen
-
Peter
warming himself
having looked at
him
she says
Also
you
with
the
Nazarene
were
-
Jesus
-
But
he denied [it]
saying
Neither
I know
nor even
understand
you
what
say
And
he went forth
out
into
the
porch
And
the
servant girl
having seen
him
began
again
to say
to those
standing by
-
This
[one] of
them
is
-
But
again
he denied
And
after
a little
again
those
standing by
were saying
-
to Peter
Truly
of
them
you are
also
for
a Galilean
you are
-
But
he began
to curse
and
to swear
-
Not
I know
the
man
this
whom
you speak of
And
immediately
for
the second time
a rooster
crowed
And
remembered
-
Peter
the
word
that
had said
to him
-
Jesus
-
Before
[the] rooster
twice
crows
three times
Me
you will deny
And
having broken down
he began to weep
And
early
in the morning
a counsel
having formed
the
chief priests
with
the
elders
and
scribes
and
all
the
Council
having bound
-
Jesus
they led [Him] away
and
delivered [Him]
to Pilate
And
questioned
Him
-
Pilate
You
are
the
King
of the
Jews
-
And
answering
to him
He says
You
have said
And
were accusing
Him
the
chief priests
of many things
-
And
Pilate
again
began to question
Him
saying
Not
answer You
nothing
See
how many things
You
they testify against
-
But
Jesus
no longer
nothing
answered
so as
to amaze
-
Pilate
At
then
[the] feast
he used to release
to them
one
prisoner
whom
they requested
There was
then
the [one]
called
Barabbas
with
the
rebels
having been bound
who
in
the
insurrection
murder
had committed
And
having cried out
the
crowd
began
to beg [him to do]
as usually
he did
for them
-
But
Pilate
answered
them
saying
Wish you [that]
I should release
to you
the
King
of the
Jews
He was aware
for
that
because of
envy
had delivered up
Him
the
chief priests
-
But
the chief priests
stirred up
the
crowd
so that
instead
-
Barabbas
he might release
to them
-
And
Pilate
again
answering
was saying
to them
What
then
I should do
to Him
you call
the
King
of the
Jews
-
And
again
they cried out
Crucify
Him
-
And
Pilate
was saying
to them
What
indeed
did He commit
evil
-
But
much more
they shouted
Crucify
Him
-
And
Pilate
desiring
to the
crowd
that which [was]
satisfactory
to do
released
to them
-
Barabbas
and
he delivered
-
Jesus
having flogged [him]
that
He might be crucified
-
And
the soldiers
led away
him
into
the
palace
that
is
[the] Praetorium
and
they call together
all
the
cohort
And
they put on
Him
purple
and
placed on
Him
having twisted together
of thorns
a crown
and
they began
to salute
Him
Hail
King
of the
Jews
And
they kept striking
His
-
head
with a reed
and
spitting on
Him
and
bending
the
knees
they were kneeling down
to Him
And
when
they had mocked
Him
they took off
him
the
purple
and
put on
Him
the
garments
His
And
they are leading out
him
that
they might crucify
Him
And
they compel
passing by
one
Simon
of Cyrene
coming
from
the country
the
father
of Alexander
and
Rufus
that
he might carry
the
cross
of Him
And
they bring
Him
to
-
Golgotha
a place
which
is
translated
of a Skull
Place
And
they were offering
Him
having been mixed with myrrh
wine
He
however
not
did take [it]
And
having crucified
Him
also
they divided
the
garments
of Him
casting
lots
for
them
who
what
should take
It was
then
[the] hour
third
and
they crucified
Him
And
there was
the
inscription
of the
accusation
against Him
having been written
The
King
of the
Jews
And
with
Him
they crucify
two
robbers
one
at
[the] right hand
and
one
at [the]
left
of Him
And
those
passing by
were railing at
Him
shaking
the
heads
of them
and
saying
Aha
The [One]
destroying
the
temple
and
building [it]
in
three
days
save
Yourself
having descended
from
the
cross
Likewise
also
the
chief priests
mocking
among
one another
with
the
scribes
were saying
Others
He saved
Himself
not
He is able
to save
The
Christ
the
King
of Israel
let Him descend
now
from
the
cross
that
we might see
and
believe
And
those
being crucified
with
Him
were upbraiding
Him
And
having arrived
[the] hour
sixth
darkness
came
over
all
the
land
until
[the] hour
ninth
And
at the
ninth
hour
cried out
-
Jesus
in a voice
loud
Eloi
Eloi
lema
sabachthani
Which
is
translated
-
God
of Me
-
God
of Me
to
why
have You forsaken
Me
And
some
of those
standing by
having heard
were saying
Behold
Elijah
He calls
Having run
then
one
and
having filled
a sponge
with vinegar
having put [it] on
a reed
gave to drink
him
saying
Let be
let us see
if
comes
Elijah
to take down
him
-
But
Jesus
having uttered
a cry
loud
breathed His last
And
the
veil
of the
temple
was torn
into
two
from
top
to
bottom
Having seen
then
the
centurion
-
standing
from
opposite of
Him
that
thus
He breathed His last
he said
Truly
this
-
man
[the] Son
of God
was
There were
then
also
women
from
afar off
looking on
among
whom
also
Mary
-
Magdalene
and
Mary
the
of James
the
least
and
of Joseph
mother
and
Salome
who
when
He was
in
-
Galilee
had been following
Him
and
had been ministering
to Him
and
other
many
those
having come up with
Him
to
Jerusalem
And
already
evening
having arrived
since
it was [the]
Preparation
that
is
the day before Sabbath
having come
Joseph
-
from
Arimathea
a prominent
Council member
who
also
himself
was
waiting for
the
kingdom
-
of God
having boldness
went in
to
-
Pilate
and
asked for
the
body
-
of Jesus
-
And
Pilate
wondered
if
already
He were dead
And
having called to [him]
the
centurion
he questioned
him
whether
already
He had died
And
having known [it]
from
the
centurion
He granted
the
body
-
to Joseph
And
having bought
a linen cloth
having taken down
him
he wrapped [Him] in
the
linen cloth
and
laid
Him
in
a tomb
which
was
cut
out of
a rock
And
he rolled
a stone
to
the
door
of the
tomb
-
And
Mary
-
Magdalene
and
Mary
the [mother]
of Joseph
were watching
where
He was laid
And
having passed
the
Sabbath
Mary
-
Magdalene
and
Mary
the [mother]
-
of James
and
Salome
bought
spices
that
having come
they might anoint
Him
And
very
early
on the
first [day]
of the
week
they come
to
the
tomb
having arisen
the
sun
And
they were saying
among
themselves
Who
will roll away
for us
the
stone
from
the
door
of the
tomb
And
having looked up
they see
that
has been rolled away
the
stone
it was
for
large
extremely
And
having entered
into
the
tomb
they saw
a young man
sitting
on
the
right
clothed in
a robe
white
and
they were greatly amazed
-
And
he says
to them
Not
be amazed
Jesus
you seek
the
Nazarene
the [One]
having been crucified
He is risen
Not
He is
here
Behold
the
place
where
they laid
Him
But
go
say
the
disciples
of Him
and
-
to Peter
that
He goes before
you
into
-
Galilee
there
Him
will you see
as
He said
to you
And
having gone out
they fled
from
the
tomb
Had seized
for
them
trembling
and
amazement
and
to none
nothing
they spoke
they were afraid
for
Having risen
now
early [the]
first [day]
of the week
He appeared
first
to Mary
-
Magdalene
from
whom
He had cast out
seven
demons
She
having gone
told [it]
to those
with
Him
having been
mourning
and
weeping
And they
having heard
that
He is alive
and
has been seen
by
her
disbelieved
After
now
these things
to two
of
them
as they are walking
He appeared
in
another
form
going
into
[the] country
And they
having gone
told [it]
to the
rest
neither
them
did they believe
Afterward
now
were reclining
they
to the
eleven
He appeared
and
rebuked
the
unbelief
of them
and
hardness of heart
because
those
having seen
Him
arisen
not
they believed
And
He said
to them
Having gone
into
the
world
all
proclaim
the
gospel
to all
the
creation
The [one]
having believed
and
having been baptized
will be saved
the [one]
however
having disbelieved
will be condemned
Signs
now
those
having believed
these
will accompany
In
the
name
of Me
demons
they will cast out
with tongues
they will speak
new
serpents
they will take up
and if
deadly
anything
they drink
no
not
them
shall it hurt
upon
[the] sick
hands
they will lay
and
well
they will be
-
Indeed
therefore
the Lord
Jesus
after
-
speaking
to them
was taken up
into
the
heaven
and
sat
at [the]
right hand
-
of God
They
now
having gone forth
preached
everywhere
the
Lord
working with [them]
and
the
word
confirming
by
the
accompanying
signs

































Inasmuch as
many
have undertaken
to draw up
a narration
concerning
the
having been accomplished
among
us
things
as
delivered [them]
to us
those
from
[the] beginning
eyewitnesses
and
servants
having been
of the
word
it seemed good
also to me
having been acquainted
from the first
with all things
carefully
with method
to you
to write
most excellent
Theophilus
so that
you may know
concerning
which
you were instructed
[of the] things
the
certainty
There was
in
the
days
of Herod
king
-
of Judea
a priest
certain
named
Zechariah
of [the]
division
of Abijah
and
wife
of him
of
the
daughters
of Aaron
and
the
name
of her
Elizabeth
They were
now
righteous
both
before
-
God
walking
in
all
the
commandments
and
ordinances
of the
Lord
blameless
And
no
there was
to them
child
inasmuch as
was
-
Elizabeth
barren
and
both
advanced
in
the
years
of them
were
It came to pass
now
in
the
fulfilling the priestly service
of him
in
the
order
of the
division
of him
before
-
God
according to
the
custom
of the
priesthood
it fell to him by lot
-
to burn incense
having entered
into
the
temple
of the
Lord
And
all
the
multitude
were
of the
people
praying
outside
at the
hour
of the
incense
Appeared
then
to him
an angel
of [the] Lord
standing
at
[the] right
of the
altar
of the
incense
And
was troubled
Zechariah
having seen [him]
and
fear
fell
upon
him
Said
then
to
him
the
angel
Not
fear
Zechariah
because
has been heard
the
prayer
of you
and
the
wife
of You
Elizabeth
will bear
a son
to you
and
you shall call
the
name
of him
John
And
he will be
joy
to you
and
gladness
and
many
at
the
birth
of him
will rejoice
He will be
for
great
before
Lord
and
wine
and
strong drink
no
not
shall he drink
and
[of the] Spirit
Holy
he will be filled
even
from
[the] womb
of [the] mother
of him
And
many
of the
sons
of Israel
he will turn
to
[the] Lord
the
God
of them
And
he
will go forth
before
Him
in
[the] spirit
and
power
of Elijah
to turn
[the] hearts
of [the] fathers
to
[the] children
and
[the] disobedient
to
[the] wisdom
of [the] righteous
to make ready
for [the] Lord
a people
prepared
And
said
Zechariah
to
the
angel
By
what
will I know
this
I
for
am
an old man
and
the
wife
of me
is advanced
in
the
years
of her
And
answering
the
angel
said
to him
I
am
Gabriel
the [one]
standing
before
-
God
and
I was sent
to speak
to
you
and
to bring glad tidings
to you
these
And
behold
you will be
silent
and
not
able
to speak
until
that
day
shall take place
these things
in return for
that
not
you did believe
the
words
of me
which
will be fulfilled
in
the
season
of them
And
were
the
people
expecting
-
Zechariah
and
they were wondering
at
the
delaying
in
the
temple
of him
Having come out
then
not
he was able
to speak
to them
and
they recognized
that
a vision
he had seen
in
the
temple
And
he
was
making signs
to them
and
remained
mute
And
it came to pass
when
were fulfilled
the
days
of the
service
of him
he departed
to
the
home
of him
After
then
these
-
days
conceived
Elizabeth
the
wife
of him
and
hid
herself
months
five
saying
-
Thus
to me
has done
the Lord
in
[the] days
in which
He looked upon [me]
to take away
[the] disgrace
of me
among
men
In
now
the
month
-
sixth
was sent
the
angel
Gabriel
by
-
God
to
a city
-
of Galilee
whose
name [was]
Nazareth
to
a virgin
betrothed
to a man
whose
name [was]
Joseph
of
[the] house
of David
and
the
name
of the
virgin
[was] Mary
And
having come
to
her
he said
Greetings
[you] favored with grace
The
Lord [is]
with
you
-
And
at
the
statement
she was troubled
and
was pondering
what kind
might be
the
salutation
this
And
said
the
angel
to her
Not
fear
Mary
you have found
for
favor
with
-
God
and
behold
you will conceive
in
womb
and
will bring forth
a son
and
you shall call
the
name
of Him
Jesus
He
will be
great
and
Son
of [the] Most High
He will be called
and
will give
Him
[the] Lord
-
God
the
throne
of David
of the
father
of Him
and
He will reign
over
the
house
of Jacob
to
the
ages
and
of the
kingdom
of Him
not
there will be
an end
Said
then
Mary
to
the
angel
How
will be
this
since
a man
not
I know
And
answering
the
angel
said
to her
[the] Spirit
Holy
will come
upon
you
and
power
of [the] Most High
will overshadow
you
therefore
also
the
being born
Holy [One]
will be called
[the] Son
of God
And
behold
Elizabeth
the
relative
of you
also
she
has conceived
a son
in
old age
her
and
this
month
[the] sixth
is
to her
who
[was] called
barren
For
not
will be impossible
with
-
God
every
thing
Said
then
Mary
Behold
the
handmaid
of [the] Lord
May it happen
to me
according to
the
word
of you
And
departed
from
her
the
angel
Having risen up
then
Mary
in
the
days
this
she went
into
the
hill country
with
haste
to
a town
of Judah
and
she entered
into
the
house
of Zechariah
and
greeted
-
Elizabeth
And
it came to pass
as
heard
the
greeting
-
of Mary
-
Elizabeth
leaped
the
baby
in
the
womb
of her
and
was filled
with [the] Spirit
Holy
-
Elizabeth
and
she cried out
in a voice
loud
and
said
Blessed are
you
among
women
and
blessed is
the
fruit
of the
womb
of you
And
from where
to me
this
that
should come
the
mother
of the
Lord
of me
to
me
Behold
for
as
came
the
voice
of the
greeting
of you
into
the
ears
of me
leaped
in
exultation
the
baby
in
the
womb
of me
And
blessed [is]
the [one]
having believed
that
there will be
a fulfillment
to the things
spoken
to her
from
[the] Lord
And
said
Mary
Magnifies
the
soul
of Me
the
Lord
and
rejoices
the
spirit
of me
in
-
God
the
Savior
of me
For
He has looked
upon
the
humiliation
of the
handmaiden
of Him
Behold
for
from
-
henceforth
will count blessed
me
all
the
generations
For
has done
to me
great things
the
Mighty One
And
holy [is]
the
name
of Him
And
the
mercy
of Him
[is] to
generations
and
generations
to those
fearing
Him
He has shown
strength
with
the arm
of Him
He has scattered
[the] proud
in [the] thought
of heart
of them
He has brought down
rulers
from
thrones
and
exalted
[the] humble
[Those] hungering
He has filled
with good things
and
[those] being rich
He has sent away
empty
He has helped
Israel
[the] servant
of Him
remembering
mercy
as
He spoke
to
the
fathers
of us
-
to Abraham
and
to the
descendants
of him
to
the
age
Dwelt
then
Mary
with
her
about
months
three
and
returned
to
the
home
of her
To
now
Elizabeth
was fulfilled
the
time
-
to give birth
for her
and
she bore
a son
And
heard
the
neighbors
and
-
relatives
of her
that
was magnifying
[the] Lord
the
mercy
of Him
with
her
and
they were rejoicing with
her
And
it came to pass
on
-
day
the
eighth
they came
to circumcise
the
child
and
were calling
it
after
the
name
of the
father
of him
Zechariah
And
answering
the
mother
of him
said
No
but
he will be called
John
And
they said
to
her
-
No one
is
among
the
relatives
of you
who
is called
the
name
by this
They were making signs
then
to the
father
of him
the
what
-
he might wish
to be called
him
And
having asked for
a writing tablet
he wrote
saying
John
is
[the] name
of him
And
they marveled
all
Was opened
then
the
mouth
of him
immediately
and
the
tongue
of him
and
he was speaking
blessing
-
God
And
came
upon
all
fear
those
dwelling around
them
and
in
all
the
hill country
-
of Judea
were being talked about
all
the things
words
these
And
laid [them] up
all
those
having heard
in
the
heart
of them
saying
What
then
the
child
this
will be
And
for
[the] hand
of [the] Lord
was
with
him
And
Zechariah
the
father
of him
was filled
with [the] Spirit
Holy
and
prophesied
saying
Blessed be
[the] Lord
the
God
-
of Israel
because
He has visited
and
has performed
redemption
[on] the
people
of Him
and
has raised up
a horn
of salvation
for us
in
[the] house
of David
of [the] servant
of Him
as
He spoke
by
[the] mouth
of the
holy
of
old
prophets
of Him
salvation
from
[the] enemies
of us
and
from
[the] hand
of all
those
hating
us
to fulfill
mercy
toward
the
fathers
of us
and
to remember
[the] covenant
holy
of Him
[the] oath
that
He swore
to
Abraham
the
father
of us
-
to grant
us
without fear
from
[the] hand
of our enemies
having been saved
to serve
Him
in
holiness
and
righteousness
before
Him
all
the
days
of our life
And
you
now
child
prophet
of [the] Most High
will be called
you will go
for
before
the Lord
to prepare
ways
of Him
-
to give
knowledge
of salvation
to
people
of Him
in
forgiveness
of [the] sins
of them
through
[the] affections
of compassion
of God
of us
in
which
will visit
us
[the] Sunrise
from
on high
to shine upon
those
in
darkness
and
in [the] shadow
of death
sitting
-
to direct
the
feet
of us
into
[the] way
of peace
-
And
the child
continued to grow
and
was strengthened
in spirit
and
he was
in
the
deserted places
until
[the] day
of appearance
of him
to
-
Israel
It came to pass
then
in
the
days
those
went out
a decree
from
Caesar
Augustus
to register
all
the
world
This
registration
first
took place [when]
was governing
-
Syria
Quirinius
And
were going
all
to be registered
each
to
the
of themselves
city
Went up
then
also
Joseph
from
-
Galilee
out of
[the] town
of Nazareth
to
-
Judea
to
[the] City
of David
which
is called
Bethlehem
because of
-
being
his
of
[the] house
and
family
of David
to register
with
Mary
the [one]
being betrothed
to him
she being
with child
It came to pass
then
in
their
being
-
there
were fulfilled
the
days
of the
giving birth
of her
And
she brought forth
the
son
of her
the
firstborn
and
wrapped in swaddling cloths
him
and
laid
Him
in
a manger
because
not
there was
for them
a place
in
the
inn
And
shepherds
were
in
the
region
-
same
lodging in the fields
and
keeping
watch
-
by night
over
the
flock
of them
And
an angel
of [the] Lord
stood by
them
and
[the] glory
of [the] Lord
shone around
them
and
they feared
[with] fear
great
And
said
to them
the
angel
Not
fear
behold
for
I bring good news
to you
[of] joy
great
which
will be
to all
the
people
For
has been born
to you
today
a Savior
who
is
Christ
[the] Lord
in
[the] City
of David
And
this [is]
to you
sign
You will find
a baby
wrapped in swaddling cloths
and
lying
in
a manger
And
suddenly
there came
with
the
angel
a multitude
of [the] host
heavenly
praising
-
God
and
saying
Glory
in
[the] highest
to God
and
on
earth
peace
among
men
with whom He is pleased
And
it came to pass
as
were departing
from
them
into
the
heaven
the
angels
the
shepherds
were saying
to
one another
Let us go through
indeed
as far as
Bethlehem
and
let us see
the
word
this
that
has come to pass
which
the
Lord
has made known
to us
And
they came
having hurried
and
found
-
both
Mary
and
-
Joseph
and
the
baby
lying
in
the
manger
Having seen
now
they proclaimed abroad
concerning
the
saying
-
having been told
them
concerning
the
Child
this
And
all
those
having heard
marveled
concerning
the things
having been spoken
by
the
shepherds
to
them
-
But
Mary
all
was treasuring up
-
matters
these
pondering [them]
in
the
heart
of her
And
returned
the
shepherds
glorifying
and
praising
-
God
for
all things
which
they had heard
and
seen
as
it was said
to
them
And
when
were fulfilled
days
eight
-
to circumcise
Him
then
was called
the
name
of Him
Jesus
which
He had been called
by
the
angel
before
-
was conceived
He
in
the
womb
And
when
were fulfilled
the
days
of the
purification
of them
according to
the
law
of Moses
they brought
Him
to
Jerusalem
to present
to the
Lord
as
it has been written
in [the]
law
of [the] Lord
-
Every
male
opening
a womb
holy
to the
Lord
shall be called
and
-
to offer
a sacrifice
according to
that
having been said
in
the
law
of [the] Lord
A pair
of turtle doves
or
two
young
pigeons
And
behold
a man
there was
in
Jerusalem
whose
name [was]
Simeon
and
the
man
this
[was] righteous
and
devout
waiting for
[the] consolation
-
of Israel
and
[the] Spirit
was
Holy
upon
him
And
it was
to him
divinely revealed
by
the
Spirit
-
Holy
not
to see
death
before
that
-
he should see
the
Christ
of [the] Lord
And
he came
in
the
Spirit
into
the
temple
and
in
the [time when]
were bringing in
the
parents
the
child
Jesus
the [thing]
were doing
they
according to
that
having become customary
by the
law
for
Him
then
he
received
Him
into
the
arms
and
blessed
-
God
and
said
Now
You dismiss
the
servant
of You
Lord
according to
the
word
of You
in
peace
for
have seen
the
eyes
of me
the
salvation
of You
which
You have prepared
before
[the] face
of all
the
peoples
a light
for
revelation
of [the] Gentiles
and
glory
of [the] people
of You
Israel
And
were
the
father
of Him
and
the
mother
marveling
at
the things
having been spoken
concerning
Him
And
blessed
them
Simeon
and
said
to
Mary
the
mother
of Him
Behold
this [Child]
is appointed
for
[the] falling
and
rising up
of many
in
-
Israel
and
for
a sign
spoken against
and
of you
also
of her
the
soul
will go through
a sword
so that
-
may be revealed
of
many
hearts
[the] thoughts
And
there was
Anna
a prophetess
daughter
of Phanuel
of
[the] tribe
of Asher
she
being advanced
in
years
great
having lived
with
a husband
years
seven
from
the
marriage
of herself
and
she
[was] a widow
of about
years
eighty [and]
four
who
not
departed
the
temple
with fastings
and
prayers
serving
night
and
day
And
she
at that
hour
having come up
was giving praise
-
to God
and
was speaking
concerning
Him
to all
those
waiting for
[the] redemption
of Jerusalem
And
when
they had performed
everything
-
according to
the
law
of [the] Lord
they returned
to
-
Galilee
to the
town
of them
Nazareth
-
And
the Child
continued to grow
and
become strong
being filled
with wisdom
and
[the] grace
of God
was
upon
Him
And
were going
the
parents
of Him
every
year
to
Jerusalem
at the
feast
of the
Passover
And
when
He was
years [old]
twelve
having gone up
they
according to
the
custom
of the
Feast
and
having completed
the
days
in
the
returning
of them
remained behind
Jesus
the
boy
in
Jerusalem
But
not
knew
the
parents
of Him
Having supposed
now
Him
to be
in
their
company
they went
a dayâs
journey
and
began seeking
Him
among
the
relatives
and
the
acquaintances
and
not
having found [Him]
they returned
to
Jerusalem
seeking
Him
And
it came to pass
after
days
three
they found
Him
in
the
temple
sitting
in
[the] midst
of the
teachers
both
hearing
them
and
questioning
them
Were amazed
then
all
those
hearing
Him
at
the
understanding
and
the
answers
of Him
And
having seen
Him
they were astonished
and
said
to
Him
the
mother
of Him
Child
why
have You done
to us
thus
Behold
the
father
of You
and I
distressing
were seeking
You
And
He said
to
them
Why [is it]
that
you were seeking
Me
Not
knew you
that
in
the [house]
of the
Father
of Me
it behooves
to be
Me
And
they
not
understood
the
word
that
He spoke
to them
And
He went down
with
them
and
came
to
Nazareth
and
He was
subject
to them
And
the
mother
of Him
was treasuring up
all
the
matters
in
the
heart
of her
And
Jesus
continued to advance
in
-
wisdom
and
stature
and
in favor
with
God
and
men
In
year
then
fifteenth
of the
reign
of Tiberius
Caesar
being governor
Pontius
Pilate
-
of Judea
and
being tetrarch
-
of Galilee
Herod
Philip
now
the
brother
of him
being tetrarch
-
of Ituraea
and
of Trachonitis
[the] region
and
Lysanias
-
of Abilene
being tetrarch
during
[the] high priesthood
of Annas
and
Caiaphas
came
[the] word
of God
upon
John
-
of Zechariah
son
in
the
wilderness
And
he went
into
all
the
surrounding region
of the
Jordan
proclaiming
a baptism
of repentance
for
forgiveness
of sins
as
it has been written
in
[the] book
of [the] words
of Isaiah
the
prophet
[The] voice
of one crying
in
the
wilderness
Prepare
the
way
of [the] Lord
straight
make
the
paths
of Him
Every
valley
will be filled
and
every
mountain
and
hill
will be made low
and
will become
the
crooked
into
straight
and
the
rough
into
ways
smooth
and
will see
all
flesh
the
salvation
-
of God
He was saying
therefore
to the
coming out
crowds
to be baptized
by
him
Offspring
of vipers
who
forewarned
you
to flee
from
the
coming
wrath
Produce
therefore
fruits
worthy
-
of repentance
and
not
begin
to say
in
yourselves
[As] father
We have
-
Abraham
I say
for
to you
that
is able
-
God
from
-
stones
these
to raise up
children
-
to Abraham
Already
now
also
the
ax
to
the
root
of the
trees
is applied
every
therefore
tree
not
producing
fruit
good
is cut down
and
into
[the] fire
is thrown
And
were asking
him
the
crowds
saying
What
then
shall we do
Answering
now
he was saying
to them
The [one]
having
two
tunics
let him impart
to the [one]
none
having
and
the [one]
having
food
likewise
let him do
Came
then
also
tax collectors
to be baptized
and
they said
to
him
Teacher
what
shall we do
-
And
he said
to
them
Nothing
more
beyond
that
having been appointed
to you
collect
Were asking
then
him
also
those being soldiers
saying
What
shall do
also
we
And
he said
to them
No one
extort
nor
accuse falsely
and
be content with
the
wages
of you
Are expecting
then
the
people
and
wondering
all
in
the
hearts
of them
concerning
-
John
whether
ever
he
might be
the
Christ
Answered
saying
[to] all
-
John
I
indeed
with water
baptize
you
comes
however
the [One]
mightier
than I
of whom
not
I am
worthy
to untie
the
strap
of the
sandals
of Him
He
you
will baptize
with
[the] Spirit
Holy
and
with fire
of whom
the
winnowing fork [is]
in
the
hand
of Him
to clear
the
threshing floor
of Him
and
to gather
the
wheat
into
the
barn
of Him
-
But
the chaff
He will burn up
with fire
unquenchable
Many
indeed
therefore
other
things
exhorting
he was preaching the good news to
the
people
-
And
Herod
the
tetrarch
being reproved
by
him
concerning
Herodias
the
wife
of the
brother
of him
and
concerning
all
that
had done
[the] evils
-
Herod
added
yet
this
to
all
he locked up
-
John
in
prison
It came to pass
now
in
-
having been baptized
all
the
people
and
Jesus
having been baptized
and
having prayed
was opened
the
heaven
and
descended
the
Spirit
-
Holy
in a bodily
form
as
a dove
upon
Him
and
a voice
out of
heaven
came
You
are
the
Son
of Me
the
beloved
in
You
I am well pleased

Jesus
then
full
of [the] Spirit
Holy
returned
from
the
Jordan
and
was led
by
the
Spirit
into
the
wilderness
days
forty
being tempted
by
the
devil
And
not
He ate
nothing
in
the
days
those
and
having ended
they
He was hungry
Said
then
to Him
the
devil
If
[the] Son
You are
-
of God
speak
to the
stone
this
that
it should become
bread
And
answered
to
him
-
Jesus
It has been written
-
Not
on
bread
alone
shall live
the
man
And
having led up
Him
he showed
Him
all
the
kingdoms
of the
world
in
a moment
of time
And
said
to Him
the
devil
To You
will I give
the
authority
this
all
and
the
glory
of it
for
to me
it has been delivered
and
to whom
if
I wish
I give
it
You
therefore
if
You will worship
before
me
will be
Yours
all
And
answering
-
Jesus
said
to him
It has been written
You shall worship
[the] Lord
-
God
of You
and
Him
only
you shall serve
He led
also
Him
to
Jerusalem
and
set
upon
the
pinnacle
of the
temple
and
said
to Him
If
[the] Son
You are
-
of God
cast
Yourself
from here
down
It has been written
for
-
To the
angels
of Him
He will give orders
concerning
You
-
to guard
You
and
-
in
[their] hands
will they bear
You
lest
ever
You strike
against
a stone
the
foot
of You
And
answering
said
to him
-
Jesus
-
It has been said
Not
you shall test
[the] Lord
the
God
of you
And
having finished
every
temptation
the
devil
departed
from
Him
until
an opportune time
And
returned
-
Jesus
in
the
power
of the
Spirit
to
-
Galilee
and
a report
went out
into
all
the
surrounding region
concerning
Him
And
He
was teaching
in
the
synagogues
of them
being glorified
by
all
And
He came
to
Nazareth
where
He had been
brought up
and
He entered
according to
the
custom
to Him
on
the
day
of the
Sabbaths
into
the
synagogue
and
stood up
to read
And
there was given
to Him
[the] scroll of
the
prophet
Isaiah
and
having unrolled
the
scroll
He found
the
place
where
it was
written
[The] Spirit
of [the] Lord [is]
upon
Me
of which
because
He has anointed
Me
to preach good news
to [the] poor
He has sent
Me
to proclaim
to [the] captives
deliverance
and
to [the] blind
recovery of sight
to send forth
[the] oppressed
in
deliverance
to proclaim
[the] year
of [the] Lordâs
favor
And
having rolled up
the
scroll
having delivered [it]
to the
attendant
He sat down
and
of all
the
eyes
in
the
synagogue
were
fixed upon
Him
He began
then
to say
to
them
-
Today
is fulfilled
the
Scripture
this
in
the
hearing
of you
And
all
were bearing witness
to Him
and
marveling
at
the
words
of the
grace
that
are proceeding
out of
the
mouth
of Him
and
they were saying
Not
the son
is
of Joseph
this
And
He said
to
them
Surely
you will say
to Me
the
proverb
this
Physician
heal
yourself
Whatsoever
we have heard
has been done
in
-
Capernaum
do
also
here
in
the
hometown
of You
He said
then
Truly
I say
to you
that
no
prophet
acceptable
is
in
the
hometown
of him
In
truth
now
I say
to you
many
widows
there were
in
the
days
of Elijah
in
-
Israel
when
was shut up
the
heaven
for
years
three
and
months
six
when
there was
a famine
great
upon
all
the
land
and
to
none
of them
was sent
Elijah
if
not
to
Zarephath
-
of Sidon
to
a woman
a widow
And
many
lepers
were
in
-
Israel
in the time
of Elisha
the
prophet
and
none
of them
was cleansed
if
not
Naaman
the
Syrian
And
were filled
all
with anger
in
the
synagogue
hearing
these things
and
having risen up
they cast
Him
out
of [the]
city
and
led
Him
unto
brow
of the
hill
upon
which
the
town
had been built
of them
in order
to throw over
him
He
however
having passed
through
[the] midst
of them
went away
And
He went down
to
Capernaum
a city
-
of Galilee
And
He was
teaching
them
on
the
Sabbaths
and
they were astonished
at
the
teaching
of Him
for
with
authority
was
the
message
of Him
And
in
the
synagogue
was
a man
having
a spirit
of a demon
unclean
and
he cried out
in a voice
loud
Ha
What
to us
and
to You
Jesus
of Nazareth
Are You come
to destroy
us
I know
You
who
are
the
Holy [One]
-
of God
And
rebuked
him
-
Jesus
saying
Be silent
and
come forth
out of
him
And
having thrown
him
the
demon
into
the
midst
it came out
from
him
in nothing
having hurt
him
And
came
astonishment
upon
all
and
they were speaking
to
one another
saying
What
-
word
[is] this
that
with
authority
and
power
He commands
the
unclean
spirits
and
they come out
And
was spreading
the report
concerning
Him
into
every
place
of the
surrounding region
Having risen up
then
out of
the
synagogue
He entered
into
the
house
of Simon
[The] mother-in-law
then
-
of Simon
was
oppressed with
a fever
great
and
they appealed
to Him
for
her
And
having stood
over
her
He rebuked
the
fever
and
it left
her
immediately
then
having arisen
she began to serve
them
At the setting
now
of the
sun
all
as many as
had [any]
ailing
with diseases
various
brought
them
to
Him
-
and
on one
each
of them
the
hands
having laid
He would heal
them
Were going out
now
also
demons
from
many
crying out
and
saying
-
You
are
the
Son
-
of God
And
rebuking [them]
not
did He allow
them
to speak
because
they knew
the
Christ
Him
to be
Having arrived
now
daybreak
having gone out
He went
into
a solitary
place
and
the
crowds
were seeking
Him
and
they came
up to
Him
and
were detaining
Him
of the
not
to go
from
them
-
But
He said
to
them
-
Also
to the
other
towns
to preach [the] good news
Me
it behooves
of the
kingdom
-
of God
because
for
this
have I been sent forth
And
He was
preaching
in
the
synagogues
-
of Judea
It came to pass
then
in
-
the
crowd
pressing on
Him
also
to hear
the
word
of
God
and
He
was
standing
by
the
lake
of Gennesaret
and
He saw
boats
two
lying
by
the
lake
-
but
the fishermen
from
them
having gone out
were washing
the
nets
Having entered
then
into
one
of the
boats
which
was
Simonâs
He asked
him
from
the
land
to put off
a little
Having sat down
then
from
the
boat
He was teaching
the
crowds
When
then
He left off
speaking
He said
to
-
Simon
Put off
into
the
deep
and
let down
the
nets
of you
for
a catch
And
answering
Simon
said
Master
through
whole
night
having toiled
nothing
have we taken
at
however
the
word
of You
I will let down
the
nets
And
this
having done
they enclosed
a multitude
of fishes
great
were breaking
now
the
nets
of them
And
they beckoned
to the
partners
in
the
other
boat
-
having come
to help
them
and
they came
and
filled
both
the
boats
so that
were sinking
they
Having seen
now
Simon
Peter
fell at
the
knees
of Jesus
saying
Depart
from
me
for
a man
sinful
am I
Lord
Amazement
for
laid hold
on him
and
on all
those
with
him
at
the
catch
of the
fish
which
they had taken
likewise
now
also
James
and
John
[the] sons
of Zebedee
who
were
partners
-
with Simon
And
said
to
-
Simon
-
Jesus
Not
fear
from
-
now on
men
you will be
catching
And
having brought
the
boats
to
the
land
having left
all
they followed
Him
And
it came to pass
in
-
being
His
in
one
of the
cities
that
behold
a man
full
of leprosy
having seen
then
-
Jesus
having fallen
upon
[his] face
begged
Him
saying
Lord
if
You would be willing
You are able
me
to cleanse
And
having stretched out
the
hand
He touched
him
saying
I am willing
be you cleansed
And
immediately
the
leprosy
departed
from
him
And
He
ordered
him
no one
to tell
But
having gone
show
yourself
to the
priest
and
offer
for
the
cleansing
of you
as
commanded
Moses
for
a testimony
to them
Was spread abroad
now
still more
the
report
concerning
Him
and
were coming
crowds
great
to hear
and
to be healed
from
the
sicknesses
of them
He Himself
now
was
withdrawing
into
the
wilderness
and
praying
And
it came to pass
on
one
of the
days
that
He
was
teaching
and
there were
sitting by
Pharisees
and
teachers of the law
who
were
come
out of
every
village
-
of Galilee
and
of Judea
and
of Jerusalem
And
[the] power
of [the] Lord
was [there]
for
-
to heal
Him
And
behold
men
carrying
upon
a mat
a man
who
was
paralyzed
and
they were seeking
him
to bring in
and
to place
before
Him
And
not
having found
what way
they should bring in
him
on account of
the
crowd
having gone up
on
the
housetop
through
the
tiles
they let down
him
with
the
mat
into
the
midst
before
-
Jesus
And
having seen
the
faith
of them
He said
Man
have been forgiven
you
the
sins
of you
And
began
to reason
the
scribes
and
the
Pharisees
saying
Who
is
this
who
speaks
blasphemies
Who
is able
sins
to forgive
if
not
alone
-
God
Having known
now
-
Jesus
the
reasonings
of them
answering
He said
to
them
Why
reason you
in
the
hearts
of you
Which
is
easier
to say
Have been forgiven
you
the
sins
of you
or
to say
Arise
and
walk
That
however
you may know
that
the
Son
-
of Man
authority
has
on
the
earth
to forgive
sins
He said
to the [one]
having been paralyzed
To you
I say
arise
and
having taken up
the
mat
of you
go
to
the
house
of you
And
immediately
having stood up
before
them
having taken up
[that] on
which
he was lying
he departed
to
the
home
of him
glorifying
-
God
And
amazement
seized
all
and
they were glorifying
-
God
and
were filled
with fear
saying
-
We have seen
remarkable things
today
And
after
these things
He went forth
and
He saw
a tax collector
named
Levi
sitting
at
the
tax booth
and
He said
to him
Follow
Me
And
having left
all
having arisen
he began to follow
Him
And
made
a banquet
great
Levi
for Him
in
the
house
of him
and
there was
a multitude
great
of tax collectors
and
others
who
were
with
them
reclining
And
were grumbling
the
Pharisees
and
the
scribes
of them
at
the
disciples
of Him
saying
Because of
why
with
the
tax collectors
and
sinners
do you eat
and
drink
And
answering
-
Jesus
said
to
them
No
need
have
those
being well
of a physician
but
those
sick
being
Not
I have come
to call
righteous [ones]
but
sinners
to
repentance
-
And
they said
to
Him
The
disciples
of John
fast
often
and
prayers
make
likewise
also
those
of the
Pharisees
those
however
of You
eat
and
drink
-
And
Jesus
said
to
them
Not
are you able
the
sons
of the
bridechamber
in
which [time]
the
bridegroom
with
them
is
to make
to fast
Will come
however
days
also
when
shall be taken away
from
them
the
bridegroom
then
they will fast
in
those
-
days
He was speaking
now
also
a parable
to
them
-
No one
a piece
of
a garment
new
having torn
puts [it]
on
a garment
old
if
however
otherwise
also
the
new
he will tear
and
the
old
not
will match
which [is]
[the] piece
-
of
the
new
And
no one
puts
wine
new
into
wineskins
old
if
now
otherwise
will burst
the
wine
-
new
the
wineskins
and
it
will be spilled out
and
the
wineskins
will be destroyed
But
wine
new
into
wineskins
fresh
must be put
And
no one
having drunk
old [wine]
desires
new
he says
for
The
old
better
is
It came to pass
then
on
a Sabbath
is passing along
He
through
grainfields
and
were plucking
the
disciples
of Him
and
were eating
the
heads of grain
rubbing [them]
in the
hands
Some
however
of the
Pharisees
said
Why
do you
that which
not
it is lawful
[on] the
Sabbaths
And
answering
to
them
said
-
Jesus
Not even
this
have you read
that which
did
David
when
was hungry
he himself
and
those who
with
him
were
how
he entered
into
the
house
-
of God
and
the
loaves
of the
presentation
having taken
ate
and
gave
to those
with
him
which
not
it is lawful
to eat
if
not
only
to the
priests
And
He was saying
to them
Lord
is
of the
Sabbath
the
Son
-
of Man
It came to pass
then
on
another
Sabbath
entered
He
into
the
synagogue
and
taught
and
there was
a man
there
and
the
hand
of him
the
right
was
withered
Were closely watching
now
Him
the
scribes
and
the
Pharisees
whether
on
the
Sabbath
He will heal
that
they might find [reason]
to accuse
Him
He
now
knew
the
thoughts
of them
He said
now
to the
man
the
withered
having
the
hand
Arise
and
stand
in
the
midst
And
having risen up
he stood
Said
then
-
Jesus
to
them
I ask
you
whether
it is lawful
on the
Sabbath
to do good
or
to do evil
Life
to save
or
to destroy
And
having looked around
all
on them
He said
to him
Stretch out
the
hand
of you
-
And
he did
and
was restored
the
hand
of him
They themselves
then
were filled
with rage
and
were discussing
with
one another
what
-
they might do
-
to Jesus
It came to pass
then
in
the
days
those
went out
He
to
the
mountain
to pray
and
He was
spending the night
in
-
prayer
-
to God
And
when
it became
day
He called to [Him]
the
disciples
of Him
also
having chosen out
from
them
twelve
whom
also
apostles
He named
Simon
whom
also
He named
Peter
and
Andrew
the
brother
of him
and
James
and
John
and
Philip
and
Bartholomew
and
Matthew
and
Thomas
and
James
[son of] Alphaeus
and
Simon
the [one]
called
Zealot
and
Judas [son]
of James
and
Judas
Iscariot
who
became
[the] betrayer
And
having descended
with
them
He stood
on
a place
level
and
a crowd
large
of disciples
of Him
and
a multitude
great
of the
people
from
all
-
Judea
and
Jerusalem
and
the
sea coast
of Tyre
and
Sidon
who
came
to hear
Him
and
to be healed
of
the
diseases
of them
And
those
troubled
with
spirits
unclean
were healed
And
all
the
multitude
were seeking
to touch
Him
because
power
from
Him
was going out
and
healing
all
And
He
having lifted up
the
gaze
of Him
upon
the
disciples
of Him
was saying
Blessed [are]
the
poor
for
yours
is
the
kingdom
-
of God
Blessed [are]
those
hungering
now
for
you will be filled
Blessed [are]
those
weeping
now
for
you will laugh
Blessed
are you
when
shall hate
you
-
men
and
when
they shall exclude
you
and
shall insult [you]
and
shall cast out
the
name
of you
as
evil
on account of
the
Son
-
of Man
Rejoice
in
that
-
day
and
leap for joy
behold
for
the
reward
of you
[is] great
in
-
heaven
According to
these things
of them
for
used to treat
the
prophets
the
fathers
likewise
But
woe
to you
who are
rich
for
you are receiving
the
comfort
of you
Woe
to you
who
having been filled
now
for
you will hunger
Woe to
those
laughing
now
for
you will mourn
and
will weep
Woe to you
when
well
of you
speak
all
-
men
according to
these things
of them
for
used to treat
the
false prophets
the
fathers
likewise
But
to you
I say
to those
hearing
Love
the
enemies
of you
good
do
to those
hating
you
bless
those
cursing
you
pray
for
those
mistreating
you
To the [one]
striking
you
on
the
cheek
offer
also
the
other
and
from
the [one]
taking away
your
-
cloak
also
the
tunic
not
do withhold
To everyone
asking
you
give
and
from
the [one]
taking away
what [is]
yours
not
ask [it] back
And
as
you desire
that
should do
to you
-
men
do
to them
likewise
And
if
you love
those
loving
you
what
to you
credit
is it
Even
for
-
sinners
those
loving
them
love
And
for
if
you do good
to those
doing good to
you
what
to you
credit
is it
For even
-
sinners
the
same
do
And
if
you lend [to those]
from
whom
you expect
to receive back
what
to you
credit
is it
Even
sinners
to sinners
lend
that
they might receive
the
same amount
But
love
the
enemies
of you
and
do good
and
lend
nothing
expecting in return
and
will be
the
reward
of you
great
and
you will be
sons of
the Most High
for
He
kind
is
to
the
ungrateful
and
evil
Be you
merciful
as
the
Father
of you
merciful
is
And
not
judge
that
no
not
you should be judged
and
not
condemn
that
no
not
you should be condemned
Forgive
and
you will be forgiven
Give
and
it will be given
to you
Measure
good
pressed down
shaken together
running over
will they put
into
the
lap
of you
with that
for
measure
you measure
it will be measured again
to you
He spoke
then
also
a parable
to them
Not
is able
a blind [man]
a blind [man]
to lead
Not
both
into
a pit
will fall
Not
is
a disciple
above
the
teacher
fully trained
however
everyone
will be
like
the
teacher
of him
Why
now
look you at
the
splinter
that [is]
in
the
eye
of the
brother
of you
-
and
the beam
that [is]
in
the
own
eye
not
notice
How
are you able
to say
to
brother
of you
Brother
let [that]
I might cast out
the
splinter
that [is]
in
the
eye
of you
yourself
the
in
the
eye
of you
beam
not
seeing
Hypocrite
cast out
first
the
beam
from
the
eye
of you
and
then
you will see clearly
the
splinter
-
in
the
eye
of the
brother
of you
to cast out
No
for
there is
tree
good
producing
fruit
bad
nor
again
a tree
bad
producing
fruit
good
Each
for
tree
by
the
own
fruit
is known
Not
for
from
thorns
do they gather
figs
nor
from
a bramble bush
grapes
gather they
The
good
man
out of
the
good
treasure
of the
heart
brings forth
that which [is]
good
and
the
evil
out of
the
evil
brings forth
that which [is]
evil
Out of
for
the abundance
of his heart
speaks
the
mouth
of him
Why
now
Me
do you call
Lord
Lord
and
not
do
what
I say
Everyone
who
is coming
to
Me
and
hearing
of Me
the
words
and
doing
them
I will show
you
whom
he is
like
Like
he is
to a man
building
a house
who
dug
and
deepened
and
laid
a foundation
on
the
rock
a flood
then
having come
burst upon
the
stream
the
house
that
and
not
was able
to shake
it
because
-
well
had been built
it
The [one]
however
having heard
and
not
having done
like
is
to a man
having built
a house
on
the
ground
without
a foundation
on which
burst
the
stream
and
immediately
it fell
and
was
the
ruin
of the
house
that
great
And when
He had completed
all
the
words
of Him
in
the
hearing
of the
people
He entered
into
Capernaum
Of a centurion
then
a certain
servant
sick
being
was about
to die
who
was
to him
valued highly
Having heard
then
about
-
Jesus
he sent
to
Him
elders
of the
Jews
begging
Him
that
having come
He might save
the
servant
of him
-
And
having come
to
-
Jesus
they were begging
Him
earnestly
saying
that
Worthy
he is
to whom
You will grant
this
he loves
for
the
nation
of us
and
the
synagogue
he
built
for us
-
And
Jesus
was going
with
them
Already
then
He
not
far
being distant
from
the
house
sent
friends
the
centurion
saying
to Him
Lord
not
trouble Yourself
not
for
worthy
I am
that
under
the
roof
of me
You should come
therefore
neither
myself
counted I worthy
to
You
to come
but
say
in a word
and
shall be healed
the
servant
of me
Also
for
I
a man
am
under
authority
appointed
having
under
me
soldiers
and
I say
to this [one]
Go
and
he goes
and
to another
Come
and
he comes
and
to
[the] servant
of me
Do
this
and
he does [it]
Having heard
then
these things
-
Jesus
marveled at
him
and
having turned
to the
following
Him
crowd
He said
I say
to you
not even
in
-
Israel
such great
faith
did I find
And
having returned
to
the
house
those
having been sent
found
the
servant
in good health
And
it came to pass
on
the
next [day]
He went
into
a town
called
Nain
and
were going with
Him
the
disciples
of Him
and
a crowd
great
As
then
He drew near
to the
gate
of the
town
also
behold
was being carried out
[one] having died
only begotten
son
of the
mother
of him
and
she
was
a widow
And
a crowd
of the
town
considerable
was
with
her
And
having seen
her
the
Lord
was moved with compassion
on
her
and
said
to her
Not
weep
And
having come up
He touched
the
bier
those
then
bearing [it]
stopped
And
He said
Young man
to you
I say
Arise
And
sat up
the
dead [man]
and
began
to speak
and
He gave
him
to the
mother
of him
Seized
then
fear
all
and
they began glorifying
-
God
saying
-
A prophet
great
has risen up
among
us
and
-
Has visited
-
God
the
people
of Him
And
went out
the
report
this
in
all
-
Judea
concerning
Him
and
in all
the
surrounding region
And
brought word
to John
the
disciples
of him
concerning
all
these things
And
having called near
two
certain
-
disciples
of him
-
John
sent [them]
to
the
Lord
saying
You
are
the
coming [One]
or
another
are we to look for
Having come
then
to
Him
the
men
said
John
the
Baptist
has sent
us
to
you
saying
You
are
the
coming [One]
or
another
are we to look for
At
that very
-
hour
He healed
many
of
diseases
and
afflictions
and
spirits
evil
and
to blind
many
He granted
to see
And
answering
He said
to them
Having gone
relate
to John
what
you have seen
and
heard
Blind
receive sight
lame
walk
lepers
are cleansed
and
deaf
hear
dead
are raised
poor
are gospelized
And
blessed
is
who
if
not
shall be offended
in
Me
Having departed
then
the
messengers
of John
He began
to speak
to
the
crowds
concerning
John
What
have you gone out
into
the
wilderness
to see
A reed
by
[the] wind
shaken
But
what
have you gone out
to see
A man
in
fine
clothing
arrayed
Behold
those
in
clothing
splendid
and
in luxury
living
in
the
palaces
are
But
what
have you gone out
to see
A prophet
Yes
I say
to you
and [one]
more excellent
than a prophet
This
is he
concerning
whom
it has been written
Behold
I send
the
messenger
of Me
before
[the] face
of you
who
will prepare
the
way
of You
before
You
I say
to you
a greater
among
[those] born
of women
than John
no one
is
-
yet
the least
in
the
kingdom
of
God
greater
than he
is
And
all
the
people
having heard
even
the
tax collectors
declared as righteous
-
God
having been baptized [with]
the
baptism
of John
-
but
the Pharisees
and
the
lawyers
the
counsel
-
of God
rejected
as to
themselves
not
having been baptized
by
him
To what
therefore
will I liken
the
men
of the
generation
this
And
to what
are they
like
Like
are they
to little children
-
in
the marketplace
sitting
and
calling
to each other
one
saying
We piped
to you
and
not
you did dance
we sang a dirge
and
not
you did weep
Has come
for
John
the
Baptist
neither
eating
bread
nor
drinking
wine
and
you say
A demon
He has
Has come
the
Son
-
of Man
eating
and
drinking
and
you say
Behold
a man
a glutton
and
a drunkard
a friend
of tax collectors
and
of sinners
And
was justified
-
wisdom
by
all
the
children
of her
Was asking
now
one
Him
of the
Pharisees
that
He should eat
with
him
and
having entered
into
the
house
of the
Pharisee
He reclined
And
behold
a woman
who
was
in
the
city
a sinner
And
she having known
that
He had reclined
in
the
house
of the
Pharisee
having taken
an alabaster flask
of fragrant oil
and
having stood
behind Him
at
the
feet
of Him
weeping
the
tears
she began
to wet
with the
feet
of Him
and
with the
hairs
of the
head
of her
she was wiping [them]
and
was kissing
the
feet
of Him
and
was anointing [them]
with the
fragrant oil
Having seen
now
the
Pharisee
the [one]
having invited
Him
he spoke
within
himself
saying
This
if
He were
a prophet
would have known
-
who
and
what
the
woman [is]
who
touches
Him
for
a sinner
she is
And
answering
-
Jesus
said
to
him
Simon
I have
to you
something
to say
-
And
Teacher
say [it]
he says
Two
debtors
there were
to a creditor
certain
the
one
owed
denarii
five hundred
-
and
the other
fifty
Nothing
having
they
to pay
both
he forgave
Which
therefore
of them
more
will love
him
Answering
Simon
said
I take it
that
[he] to whom
the
most
he forgave
-
And
He said
to him
Rightly
You have judged
And
having turned
to
the
woman
-
to Simon
He was saying
See you
this
the
woman
I entered
of you
into
the
house
water
of Me
for
feet
not
you gave
with her
however
-
tears
she wet
My
-
feet
and
with
[the] hair
of her
wiped [them]
A kiss
to Me
not
you gave
she herself
however
from
which [time]
I came in
not
has ceased
kissing
My
-
feet
With oil
the
head
of Me
not
you did anoint
she herself
however
with fragrant oil
anointed
the
feet
of Me
This
therefore
I say
to you
have been forgiven
the
sins
of her
-
many
for
she loved
much
to whom
however
little
is forgiven
little
he loves
He said
then
to her
Have been forgiven
your
-
sins
And
began
those
reclining
to say
within
themselves
Who
this
is
who
even
sins
forgives
He said
then
to
the
woman
The
faith
of You
has saved
you
go
in
peace
And
it came to pass
afterward
-
soon
that
He
was traveling
throughout
city
and
village
preaching
and
proclaiming the good news
of the
kingdom
-
of God
And
the
Twelve
[were] with
Him
and
women
certain
who
had been
cured
from
spirits
evil
and
infirmities
Mary
who
is called
Magdalene
from
whom
demons
seven
had gone out
and
Joanna
wife
of Chuza
a steward
of Herod
and
Susanna
and
others
many
who
were ministering
to them
out of
the
means
their own
[As] is assembling
now
a crowd
great
and
those
from each
town
are coming
to
Him
He spoke
by
a parable
Went out
the [one]
sowing
-
to sow
the
seed
of him
And
in
the
sowing
of him
some
indeed
fell
along
the
road
and
it was trampled upon
and
the
birds
of the
air
devoured
it
And
other
fell
upon
the
rock
and
having sprung up
it withered
through
-
no
having
moisture
And
other
fell
in
[the] midst
of the
thorns
and
having sprung up with [it]
the
thorns
choked
it
And
other
fell
upon
the
soil
-
good
and
having sprung up
it produced
fruit
a hundredfold
These things
saying
He was calling out
The [one]
having
ears
to hear
let him hear
Were asking
then
Him
the
disciples
of Him
What
this
means
the
parable
-
And
He said
To you
it has been given
to know
the
mysteries
of the
kingdom
-
of God
to
however
[the] rest
[it is] in
parables
so that
Seeing
not
may they see
and
hearing
not
may they understand
Is
now
this
the
parable
The
seed
is
the
word
-
of God
Those
now
along
the
road
are
those
having heard
then
comes
the
devil
and
takes away
the
word
from
the
heart
of them
that
not
having believed
they should be saved
Those
now
upon
the
rock
those who
when
they hear
with
joy
receive
the
word
and
these
a root
not
have
who
for
a time
believe
and
in
time
of testing
fall away
That
now
into
the
thorns
having fallen
these
are
those
having heard
and
under
cares
and
riches
and
pleasures
-
of life
moving along
are choked
and
not
do mature
That
now
in
the
good
soil
these
are
those
in
a heart
worthy
and
good
having heard
the
word
keep [it]
and
bring forth fruit
by
perseverance
No one
now
a lamp
having lighted
covers
it
with a vessel
or
under
a bed
puts [it]
but
on
a lampstand
puts [it]
so that
those
entering in
may see
the
light
Nothing
for
is
hidden
which
not
manifest
will become
nor
secret
which
nothing
not
shall be known
and
to
light
come
Take heed
therefore
how
you hear
whoever
-
for
might have
will be given
to him
and
whoever
-
not
might have
even
what
he seems
to have
will be taken away
from
him
Came
then
to
Him
the
mother
and
the
brothers
of Him
and
not
they were able
to get
to Him
because of
the
crowd
It was told
also
Him
The
mother
of You
and
the
brothers
of You
are standing
outside
to see
wanting
You
-
But
answering
He said
to
them
Mother
of Me
and
brothers
of me
those
are
who
the
word
-
of God
are hearing
and
doing
It came to pass
then
on
one
of the
days
also
He
entered
into
a boat
with
the
disciples
of Him
and
He said
to
them
Let us pass over
to
the
other side
of the
lake
And
they launched out
Sailing
then
of them
He fell asleep
And
came down
a storm
of wind
on
the
lake
and
they were being swamped
and
were in danger
Having come to [Him]
then
they awoke
Him
saying
Master
Master
we are perishing
-
And
having arisen
He rebuked
the
wind
and
the
raging
of the
water
and
they ceased
and
there was
a calm
He said
then
to them
Where is
the
faith
of you
Having been afraid
then
they marveled
saying
to
one another
Who
then
this
is
that
even
the
winds
He commands
and
the
water
and
they obey
Him
And
they sailed down
to
the
region
of the
Gerasenes
which
is
opposite
-
Galilee
Having gone forth
then
He
upon
the
land
met [Him]
a man
certain
out of
the
city
having
demons
and
time
a long
not
was wearing
clothing
and
in
a house
not
did abide
but
in
the
tombs
Having seen
then
-
Jesus
having cried out
he fell down before
Him
and
in a voice
loud
said
What
to me
and
to You
Jesus
Son
-
of God
the
Most High
I implore
of You
not
me
You might torment
He was commanding
for
the
spirit
-
unclean
to come out
from
the
man
Many
for
times
it had seized
him
and
he was bound
with chains
and
shackles
being kept
and
breaking
the
chains
he was driven
by
the
demon
into
the
deserts
Asked
now
him
-
Jesus
What
your
name
is
-
And
he said
Legion
because
were entered
demons
many
into
him
And
they were begging
Him
that
not
he would command
them
into
the
abyss
to go away
There was
now
there
a herd
of pigs
many
feeding
in
the
mountain
and
they begged
Him
that
He would allow
them
into
them
to enter
and
He allowed
them
Having gone out
then
the
demons
from
the
man
they entered
into
the
pigs
and
rushed
the
herd
down
the
steep bank
into
the
lake
and
was drowned
Having seen
then
those
feeding [them]
that
having taken place
they fled
and
reported [it]
to
the
city
and
to
the
country
They went out
then
to see
that
having taken place
and
they came
to
-
Jesus
and
found
sitting
the
man
from
whom
the
demons
had gone out
clothed
and
being of sound mind
at
the
feet
-
of Jesus
And
they were afraid
Related
then
to them
those
having seen [it]
how
was healed
the [one]
having been possessed by demons
And
asked
Him
all
the
multitude
of the
surrounding region
of the
Gerasenes
to depart
from
them
because
with fear
great
they were seized
He
now
having entered
into
the boat
turned back
Was begging
however
Him
the
man
from
whom
had gone
the
demons
to be [taken]
with
Him
He sent away
however
him
saying
Return
to
the
house
of you
and
relate
all that
for you
has done
-
God
And
he departed
through
all
the
city
proclaiming
all that
had done
for him
-
Jesus
When
then
-
returned
-
Jesus
received
Him
the
crowd
they were
for
all
looking for
Him
And
behold
came
a man
whose
name [was]
Jairus
and
he
a ruler
of the
synagogue
was
and
having fallen
at
the
feet
of Jesus
he began begging
Him
to come
to
the
house
of him
because
daughter
an only
was
to him
about
years [old]
twelve
and
she
was dying
As
then
-
went
He
the
crowds
were pressing around
Him
And
a woman
being
with
a flux
of blood
for
years
twelve
who
neither
was able
by
no one
to be healed
having come
behind
touched
the
fringe
the
of cloak
of Him
and
immediately
stopped
the
flux
of the
blood
of her
And
said
-
Jesus
Who [is]
the [one]
having touched
Me
Were denying [it]
however
all
said
-
Peter
Master
the
people
surround
You
and
press in
-
But
Jesus
said
Touched
Me
someone
I
for
know
power
has gone out
from
Me
Having seen
then
the
woman
that
not
she was hid
trembling
she came
and
having fallen down before
Him
for
what
cause
she touched
Him
she declared
before
all
the
people
and
how
she was healed
immediately
-
And
He said
to her
Daughter
the
faith
of you
has healed
you
go
in
peace
Still
of Him
speaking
comes
one
from
the
synagogue ruler
saying
-
Has died
the
daughter
of You
no longer
trouble
the
Teacher
-
But
Jesus
having heard
answered
him
Not
fear
only
believe
and
she will be saved
Having entered
then
into
the
house
not
He did allow
to go in
anyone
with
Him
if
not
Peter
and
John
and
James
and
the
father
of the
child
and
the
mother
They were weeping
now
all
and
mourning for
her
-
But
He said
Not
weep
not
she is dead
but
sleeps
And
they were laughing at
Him
knowing
that
she was dead
He
now
having taken hold
of the
hand
of her
called out
saying
-
Child
arise
And
returned
the
spirit
of her
and
she arose
immediately
and
He directed
to her
to be given
to eat
And
were amazed
the
parents
of her
-
and
He instructed
them
no one
to tell
what
had happened
Having called together
then
the
Twelve
He gave
to them
power
and
authority
over
all
the
demons
and
diseases
to heal
and
He sent
them
to proclaim
the
kingdom
-
of God
and
to heal
and
He said
to
them
Nothing
take
for
the
journey
neither
staff
nor
bag
nor
bread
nor
money
nor
apiece
two
tunics
to have
And
into
whatever
-
house
you might enter
there
remain
and
from there
go forth
And
as many as
-
not
might receive
you
going forth
from
the
city
that
the
dust
from
the
feet
of you
shake off
as
a testimony
against
them
Going forth
then
they were passing
through
the
villages
proclaiming the gospel
and
healing
everywhere
Heard of
now
Herod
the
Tetrarch
the things
being done
all
and
was perplexed
because
-
it was said
by
some
-
John
has been raised
out from
[the] dead
by
some
also
that
Elijah
had appeared
by others
also
that
a prophet
one
of the
ancients
had arisen
Said
then
Herod
John
I
beheaded
who
however
is
this
concerning
whom
I hear
such things
And
he was seeking
to see
Him
And
having returned
the
apostles
related
to Him
whatever
they had done
And
having taken
them
He withdrew
by
Himself
into
a town
called
Bethsaida
The
now
crowds
having known [it]
followed
Him
and
having received
them
He was speaking
to them
concerning
the
kingdom
-
of God
and
those
need
having
of healing
He was healing
-
And
the day
began
to decline
having come
then
the
Twelve
said
to Him
Dismiss
the
crowd
that
having gone
into
the
surrounding
villages
and
countryside
they might lodge
and
might find
provisions
for
here
in
a desolate
place
we are
He said
now
to
them
Give
to them
to eat
you
-
But
they said
Not
there are
to us
more
than
loaves
five
and
fish
two
if
not
having gone
we
should buy
for
all
the
people
this
food
They were
for
about
men
five thousand
He said
then
to
the
disciples
of Him
Make sit down
them
groups
of about
in
fifty
And
they did
so
and
made sit down
all
Having taken
then
the
five
loaves
and
the
two
fish
having looked up
to
the
heaven
He blessed
them
and
broke [them]
and
He kept giving [them]
to the
disciples
to set before
the
crowd
And
they ate
and
were satisfied
all
and
was taken up
that
having been a surplus
to them
of fragments
hand-baskets
twelve
And
it came to pass
as
-
was
He
praying
in
solitary
were with
Him
the
disciples
and
He questioned
them
saying
Whom
Me
the
crowds
do pronounce
to be
-
And
answering
they said
John
the
Baptist
others
also
Elijah
others
now
that
a prophet
one
of the
ancients
has arisen
He said
then
to them
You
however
whom
Me
do pronounce
to be
Peter
then
answering
said
The
Christ
-
of God
-
And
having strictly warned
them
He instructed [them]
to no one
to tell
this
having said
-
It is necessary for
the
Son
-
of Man
many things
to suffer
and
to be rejected
by
the
elders
and
chief priests
and
scribes
and
to be killed
and
on the
third
day
to be raised
He was saying
then
to
all
If
anyone
desires
after
Me
to come
let him deny
himself
and
let him take up
the
cross
of him
every
day
and
let him follow
Me
Whoever
for
-
might desire
the
life
of him
to save
will lose
it
whoever
however
-
might lose
the
life
of him
on account of
me
he
will save
it
What
for
is profited
a man
having gained
the
world
whole
himself
now
having destroyed
or
having suffered the loss of
Whoever
for
-
may have been ashamed of
Me
and
-
My
words
him
the
Son
-
of Man
will be ashamed of
when
He shall come
in
the
glory
of Himself
and
of the
Father
and
of the
holy
angels
I say
now
to you
truthfully
there are
some
of those
here
standing
who
no
not
shall taste
of death
until
-
they shall have seen
the
kingdom
-
of God
It came to pass
now
after
the
sayings
these
about
days
eight
and
having taken
Peter
and
John
and
James
He went up
on
the
mountain
to pray
And
it came to pass
in
the
praying
of Him
the
appearance
of the
face
of Him
[was] altered
and
the
clothing
of Him
white
became dazzling
And
behold
men
two
began talking with
Him
who
were
Moses
and
Elijah
Those
having appeared
in
glory
were speaking of
the
going out
of Him
which
He was about
to accomplish
in
Jerusalem
-
And
Peter
and
those
with
him
were
heavy
with sleep
having awoken fully
then
they saw
the
glory
of Him
and
the
two
men
-
standing with
Him
And
it came to pass
in
the
departing
of them
from
Him
said
-
Peter
to
-
Jesus
Master
good
it is
for us
here
to be
also
let us make
tabernacles
three
one
for You
and
one
for Moses
and
one
for Elijah
not
knowing
what
he is saying
These things
then
as he
is saying
came
a cloud
and
was overshadowing
them
they feared
then
in
the
entering
of them
into
the
cloud
And
a voice
came
out of
the
cloud
saying
This
is
the
Son
of Me
-
whom I have chosen
Him
listen to
And
as
-
occurred
the
voice
was found
Jesus
alone
And
they
were silent
and
to no one
they told
in
those
the
days
anything
of what
they had seen
It came to pass
then
the
next
day
on having come down
of them
from
the
mountain
met
Him
a crowd
great
And
behold
a man
from
the
crowd
cried out
saying
Teacher
I implore
You
to look
upon
the
son
of me
for
an only child
to me
he is
And
behold
a spirit
takes
him
and
suddenly
he cries out
and
it throws into convulsions
him
with
foaming
and
with difficulty
it departs
from
him
bruising
him
And
I begged
the
disciples
of You
that
they might cast out
it
and
not
they were able
Answering
now
-
Jesus
said
O
generation
unbelieving
and
perverted
until
when
will I be
with
you
and
bear with
you
Bring
here
the
son
of you
While
then
he was coming near
of him
threw down
him
the
demon
and
threw [him] into convulsions
Rebuked
then
-
Jesus
the
spirit
-
unclean
and
healed
the
boy
and
gave back
him
to
father
of him
Were astonished
then
all
at
the
majesty
-
of God
Of all
however
wondering
at
all
which
He did
He said
to
the
disciples
of Him
Let sink
you
into
the
ears
of you
the
words
these
-
for
the Son
-
of Man
is about
to be betrayed
into
[the] hands
of men
-
But
they understand not
the
saying
this
and
it was
veiled
from
them
that
not
they should understand
it
And
they were afraid
to ask
Him
concerning
the
saying
this
Came up
then
an argument
among
them
this
who
-
might be
greatest
of them
-
But
Jesus
having known
the
reasoning
of the
heart
of them
having taken hold of
a child
set
it
by
Him
and
He said
to them
Whoever
if
shall receive
this
-
child
in
the
name
of Me
Me
receives
and
whoever
-
Me
shall receive
receives
the [One]
having sent
Me
The [one]
for
least
among
all
you
being
he
shall be
great
Answering
now
-
John
said
Master
we saw
someone
in
the
name
of You
casting out
demons
and
we were forbidding
him
because
not
he follows
with
us
Said
then
to
him
Jesus
Not
forbid
whoever
for
not
is
against
you
for
you
is
It came to pass
then
in
the
completing
the
days
of the
ascension
of Him
that
He
the
face
steadfastly set
-
to go
to
Jerusalem
And
He sent
messengers
before
[the] face
of Him
And
having gone
they entered
into
a village
of the Samaritans
so as
to make ready
for Him
And
not
they did receive
Him
because
the
face
of Him
was [as]
going
toward
Jerusalem
Having seen [it]
now
the
disciples
James
and
John
said
Lord
will You [that]
we should call
fire
to come down
from
-
heaven
and
to consume
them
Having turned
then
He rebuked
them
And
they went
to
another
village
And
going
of them
along
the
road
said
someone
to
Him
I will follow
You
wherever
if
You may go
And
said
to him
-
Jesus
The
foxes
holes
have
and
the
birds
of the
air
nests
-
but
the Son
-
of Man
not
has
where
the
head
He might lay
He said
then
to
another
Follow
Me
-
But
he said
allow
me
first
having gone away
to bury
the
father
of me
He said
then
to him
Leave
the
dead
to bury
-
their own
dead
you
however
having gone forth
declare
the
kingdom
-
of God
Said
then
also
another
I will follow
You
Lord
first
however
allow
me
to bid farewell
to those
at
the
home
of me
Said
then
to
him
-
Jesus
No one
having laid
the
hand
upon
[the] plow
and
looking
on
the things
behind
fit
is
for the
kingdom
-
of God
After
now
these things
appointed
the
Lord
others
seventy
and
sent
them
in
two [by]
before
[the] face
of Himself
into
every
city
and
place
where
was about
He Himself
to go
He was saying
then
to
them
The
indeed
harvest [is]
plentiful
-
but
the workmen
[are] few
Pray earnestly to
therefore
the
Lord
of the
harvest
that
workmen
He may send out
into
the
harvest
of Him
Go
behold
I send forth
you
as
lambs
in
[the] midst
of wolves
Neither
carry
purse
nor
bag
nor
sandals
and
no one
on
the
road
greet
Into
whatever
now
-
you might enter
house
first
say
Peace
to the
house
this
And
if
there
is
a son
of peace
will rest
upon
him
the
peace
of you
if
however
not so
to
you
it will return
In
the same
now
-
house
remain
eating
and
drinking
the things [supplied]
by
them
worthy [is]
for
the
workman
of the
wages
of him
Not
move
from
house
to
house
And
into
whatever
-
city
you might enter
and
they receive
you
eat
the things
set before
you
And
heal
-
in
it
[the] sick
and
say
to them
Has drawn near
to
you
the
kingdom
-
of God
Into
whatever
now
-
city
you might enter
and
not
they receive
you
having gone out
into
the
streets
of it
say
Even
the
dust
-
having clung
to us
out of
the
city
of you
to
the
feet
we wipe off
against you
yet
this
know
that
has drawn near
the
kingdom
-
of God
I say
to you
that
for Sodom
in
the
day
that
more tolerable
it will be
than
the
city
for that
Woe
to you
Chorazin
Woe
to you
Bethsaida
For
if
in
Tyre
and
Sidon
had taken place
the
miracles
-
having taken place
in
you
long ago
-
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
sitting
they would have repented
But
for Tyre
and
Sidon
more tolerable
will it be
in
the
judgment
than
for you
And
you
Capernaum
not
to
heaven
will you be lifted up
to
-
Hades
you will be brought down
The [one]
hearing
you
Me
hears
and
the [one]
rejecting
you
Me
rejects
the [one]
now
Me
rejecting
rejects
the [One]
having sent
Me
Returned
then
the
seventy
with
joy
saying
Lord
even
the
demons
are subject
to us
through
the
name
of You
He said
then
to them
I beheld
-
Satan
as
lightning
out of
the
heaven
having fallen
Behold
I give
you
the
authority
-
to tread
upon
serpents
and
scorpions
and
upon
all
the
power
of the
enemy
and
nothing
you
no
not
will injure
Yet
in
this
not
rejoice
that
the
spirits
to you
are subjected
rejoice
however
that
the
names
of you
are written
in
the
heavens
In
the same
-
hour
He rejoiced
the
Spirit
-
Holy
and
said
I fully consent
to You
Father
Lord
of the
heaven
and
of the
earth
that
You have hidden
these things
from
wise
and
intelligent
and
have revealed
them
to little children
yes
-
Father
for
thus
well-pleasing
was it
before
You
All things
to Me
have been delivered
by
the
Father
of Me
And
no one
knows
who
is
the
Son
if
not
the
Father
and
who
is
the
Father
if
not
the
Son
and
to whom
if
might resolve
the
Son
to reveal [Him]
And
having turned
to
the
disciples
in
private
He said
Blessed [are]
the
eyes
-
seeing
what
you see
I say
for
to you
that
many
prophets
and
kings
desired
to see
what
you
see
and
not
saw
and
to hear
what
you hear
and
not
heard
And
behold
a lawyer
certain
stood up
testing
Him
saying
Teacher
what
having done
life
eternal
will I inherit
-
And
He said
to
him
In
the
law
what
has been written
How
read you
-
And
answering
he said
You shall love
[the] Lord
the
God
of you
with
all
the
heart
of you
and
with
all
the
soul
of you
and
with
all
the
strength
of you
and
with
all
the
mind
of you
and
The
neighbor
of you
as
yourself
He said
then
to him
Correctly
you have answered
This
do
and
you will live
-
But
desiring
to justify
himself
he said
to
-
Jesus
And
who
is
my
neighbor
Having taken [it] up
-
Jesus
said
A man
certain
was going down
from
Jerusalem
to
Jericho
and
robbers
fell among
who
both
having stripped
him
and
wounds
having inflicted
went away
having left [him]
half dead
By
chance
now
a priest
certain
was going down
on
the
road
that
and
having seen
him
he passed by on the opposite side
Likewise
now
also
a Levite
to
the
spot
having come
and
having seen [him]
passed by on the opposite side
A Samaritan
however
one
journeying
came
to
him
and
having seen
was moved with compassion
and
having approached
he bound up
the
wounds
of him
pouring on
oil
and
wine
having put
then
him
on
the
own
beast
he brought
him
to
an inn
and
took care
of him
And
on
the
next day
having taken out
two
denarii
he gave [them]
to the
innkeeper
and
said
Take care
of him
and
whatever
more
-
you might expend
of me
on
-
returning
I
will repay
you
Which
of these
-
three
a neighbor
seems
to you
to have been
of the [one]
having fallen
among
the
robbers
-
And
he said
The [one]
having shown
-
compassion
toward
him
Said
then
to him
-
Jesus
Go
and
you
do
likewise
In
now
the
proceeding
of them
He
entered
into
a village
certain
a woman
now
certain
named
Martha
received
Him
into
the
home
And
she
had
a sister
called
Mary
who
also
having sat down
at
the
feet
of the
Lord
was listening to
the
word
of Him
-
But
Martha
was distracted
about
much
service
having come up
now
she said
Lord
not
is it concerning
to You
that
the
sister
of me
alone
me
has left
to serve
Speak
therefore
to her
that
me
she might help
Answering
now
said
to her
the
Lord
Martha
Martha
you are anxious
and
troubled
about
many things
one thing
however
is
necessary
and
one thing
Mary
for
the
good
portion
has chosen
which
not
will be taken away from
her
And
it came to pass
in
-
being
His
in
a place
certain
praying
when
He ceased
said
one
of the
disciples
of Him
to
Him
Lord
teach
us
to pray
as
also
John
taught
the
disciples
of him
He said
then
to them
When
you pray
say
Father
hallowed be
the
name
of You
Come
the
kingdom
of You
The
bread
of us
-
daily
give
us
-
each
day
And
forgive
us
the
sins
of us
also
for
ourselves
we forgive
everyone
indebted
to us
and
not
lead
us
into
temptation
And
He said
to
them
Who
among
you
will have
a friend
and
will go
to
him
at midnight
and
say
to him
Friend
lend
me
three
loaves
since
a friend
of my
is come
off
a journey
to
me
and
nothing
I have
what
I will set before
him
And he
from within
answering
will say
Not
me
trouble
cause
already
the
door
has been shut
and
the
children
of me
with
me
in
the
bed
are
not
I am able
having risen up
to give
to you
I say
to you
if
even
not
he will give
to him
having risen up
because of
-
being
friend
of him
because of
yet
the
persistence
of him
having risen
he will give
him
as much as
he needs
And I
to you
say
ask
and
it will be given
to you
seek
and
you will find
knock
and
it will be opened
to you
Everyone
for
-
asking
receives
and
the [one]
seeking
finds
and
to the [one]
knocking
it will be opened
Which
now
of
you
who [is]
a father
will ask for
the
son
a fish
and
instead of
a fish
a serpent
to him
will he give
Or
also
[if] he will ask for
an egg
will he give
to him
a scorpion
If
therefore
you
evil
being
know
gifts
good
to give
to the
children
of you
how much
more
the
Father
who [is]
in
heaven
will give
[the] Spirit
Holy
to those
asking
Him
And
He was
casting out
a demon
and
it
was
mute
it came to pass
then
the
demon
having gone out
spoke
the
mute [man]
And
marveled
the
crowds
Some
then
of
them
said
By
Beelzebul
the
prince
of the
demons
He casts out
the
demons
Others
now
testing
a sign
from
heaven
were seeking
from
Him
He
now
knowing
their
-
thoughts
said
to them
Every
kingdom
against
itself
having been divided
is brought to desolation
and
a house
against
a house
falls
If
now
also
-
Satan
against
himself
is divided
how
will stand
the
kingdom
of him
For
you say
by
Beelzebul
cast out
I
the
demons
If
now
I
by
Beelzebul
cast out
the
demons
the
sons
of you
by
whom
do they cast out
On account of
this
they
of you
judges
will be
If
however
by
[the] finger
of God
I
cast out
the
demons
then
has come
upon
you
the
kingdom
-
of God
When
the
strong [man]
being armed
might guard
-
his
house
in
peace
are
the
possessions
of him
when
however
[one] stronger
than he
having come upon [him]
shall overcome
him
the
complete armor
of him
he takes away
in
which
he had trusted
and
the
plunder
of him
he divides
The [one]
not
being
with
Me
against
Me
is
and
the [one]
not
gathering
with
Me
scatters
When
the
unclean
spirit
is gone out
from
the
man
it passes
through
waterless
places
seeking
rest
and
not
finding [any]
it says
I will return
to
the
house
of me
from where
I came out
And
having come
it finds [it]
swept
and
put in order
Then
it goes
and
takes
other
spirits
more evil
than itself
seven
and
having entered
they dwell
there
and
becomes
the
last
of the
man
that
worse
than the
first
It came to pass
then
in
-
saying
His
these things
having lifted up
one
[her] voice
a woman
from
the
crowd
said
to Him
Blessed [is]
the
womb
-
having borne
You
and
[the] breasts
at which
You nursed
He
then
said
No rather
blessed [are]
those
hearing
the
word
-
of God
and
keeping it
Of the
now
crowds
being pressed around together
He began
to say
The
generation
this
generation
an evil
is
a sign
it seeks after
and
a sign
not
will be given
to it
if
not
the
sign
of Jonah
As
for
was
Jonah
to the
Ninevites
a sign
thus
will be
also
the
Son
-
of Man
to the
generation
this
The Queen
of [the] South
will rise up
in
the
judgment
with
the
men
of the
generation
this
and
will condemn
them
For
she came
from
the
ends
of the
earth
to hear
the
wisdom
of Solomon
and
behold
greater
than Solomon
here
[The] men
of Nineveh
will stand up
in
the
judgment
with
the
generation
this
and
will condemn
it
For
they repented
at
the
preaching
of Jonah
and
behold
greater
than Jonah
[is] here
But no one
a lamp
having lit
in
secret
sets it
nor
under
the
basket
but
upon
the
lampstand
that
those
entering in
the
light
may see
The
lamp
of your
body
is
the
eye
of you
When
the
eye
of you
clear
is
also
all
the
body
of you
light
is
when
however
evil
it be
also
the
body
of you
[is] dark
Take heed
therefore
lest
the
light
that [is]
in
you
darkness
be
If
therefore
the
body
of you
[is] full
of light
not
having
part
any
dark
it will be
light
all
as
when
the
lamp
-
shining
might light
you
In
then
the
speaking
asked
Him
a Pharisee
that
He would dine
with
him
having entered
then
He reclined
-
And
the Pharisee
having seen [it]
marveled
that
not
first
He washed
before
the
dinner
Said
then
the
Lord
to
him
Now
you
-
Pharisees
the
outside
of the
cup
and
of the
dish
you cleanse
-
and
the inside
of you
is full
of plundering
and
wickedness
Fools
[Did] not
the [One]
having made
the
outside
also
the
inside
make
But [of]
the things
being within
give
alms
and
behold
all things
clean
to you
are
But
woe
to you
-
Pharisees
for
you pay tithes of
-
mint
and
-
rue
and
every
herb
and
you pass by
the
justice
and
the
love
-
of God
These things
also
it behooved [you]
to do
and those
not
to neglect
Woe
to you
-
Pharisees
for
you love
the
first seat
in
the
synagogues
and
the
greetings
in
the
marketplaces
Woe
to you
for
you are
like
-
graves
-
unmarked
and
the
men
-
walking
above
not
have known [it]
Answering
now
one
of the
lawyers
says
to Him
Teacher
these things
saying
also
us
You insult
-
And
He said
Also
to you
the
lawyers
woe
For
you burden
the
men
[with] burdens
heavy to bear
and
yourselves
with one
of the
fingers
of you
not
do touch
the
burdens
Woe
to you
for
you build
the
tombs
of the
prophets
-
yet
the fathers
of you
killed
them
So
witnesses
you are
and
consent
to the
works
of the
fathers
of you
For
they
indeed
killed
them
you
now
build [their tombs]
Because of
this
also
the
Wisdom
-
of God
said
I will send
to
them
prophets
and
apostles
and
[some] of
them
they will kill
and
persecute
so that
might be charged
the
blood
of all
the
prophets
-
having been poured out
from
[the] foundation
of [the] world
against
the
generation
this
from
the blood
of Abel
to
the blood
of Zechariah
the [one]
having perished
between
the
altar
and
the
house
Yes
I say
to you
it will be required
of
the
generation
this
Woe
to you
the
lawyers
for
you have taken away
the
key
of the
knowledge
You yourselves
not
did enter
and
those who
are entering
you hindered
From there
having gone forth
of Him
began
the
scribes
and
the
Pharisees
urgently
to press upon [Him]
and
to make speak
Him
about
many things
watching
Him
to catch
in something
out of
the
mouth
of Him
In
these [times]
having been gathered together
the
myriads
of the
crowd
so as
to trample upon
one another
He began
to say
to
the
disciples
of Him
first
Take heed
to yourselves
of
the
leaven
which
is
hypocrisy
of the
Pharisees
Nothing
now
concealed up
is
which
not
will be revealed
nor
hidden
which
not
will be known
Instead
that
whatever
in
the
darkness
you have said
in
the
light
will be heard
and
what
into
the
ear
you have spoken
in
the
inner rooms
will be proclaimed
upon
the
housetops
I say
now
to you
those
friends
of Me
not
you should fear
because
of those
killing
the
body
and
after
these things
not
being able
more abundantly
anything
to do
I will show
however
you
whom
you should fear
Fear
the [One who]
after
the
killing
has
authority
to cast
into
-
hell
Yes
I say
to you
Him
fear
Not
five
sparrows
are sold for
assarion
two
And
one
of
them
not
is
forgotten
before
-
God
But
even
the
hairs
of the
head
of you
all
have been numbered
Not
fear
than many
sparrows
you are more valuable
I say
now
to you
everyone
who
-
will confess
in
Me
before
the
men
also
the
Son
-
of Man
will confess
in
him
before
the
angels
-
of God
the [one]
now
having denied
Me
before
-
men
will be denied
before
the
angels
-
of God
And
everyone
who
will speak
a word
against
the
Son
-
of Man
it will be forgiven
him
the [one]
however
against
the
Holy
Spirit
having blasphemed
not
will be forgiven
When
then
they bring
you
before
the
synagogues
and
the
rulers
and
the
authorities
not
be anxious
how
or
what
you shall reply in defense
or
what
you should say
the
for
Holy
Spirit
will teach
you
in
same
the
hour
what
it behooves [you]
to say
Said
then
one
from
the
crowd
to Him
Teacher
say
to the
brother
of me
to divide
with
me
the
inheritance
-
And
He said
to him
Man
who
Me
appointed
a judge
or
partitioner
over
you
He said
then
to
them
Beware
and
keep yourselves
from
all
covetousness
for
not
in
the
abundance
to anyone
the
life
to him
is
of
that which
possesses
of him
He spoke
then
a parable
to
them
saying
Of a man
certain
rich
brought forth abundantly
the
ground
And
he was reasoning
within
himself
saying
What
shall I do
for
not
I have
where
I will store up
the
fruits
of me
And
he said
This
will I do
I will tear down
my
-
barns
and
greater
will build
and
will store up
there
all
the
grain
and
the
goods
of me
And
I will say
to the
soul
of me
Soul
you have
many
good things
laid up
for
years
many
take your rest
eat
drink
be merry
Said
then
to him
-
God
Fool
This
-
night
the
soul
of you
is required
of
you
what
now
you did prepare
to whom
will [it] be
So [is]
the [one]
treasuring up
for himself
and
not
toward
God
being rich
He said
then
to
the
disciples
of Him
Because of
this
I say
to you
not
be anxious
for the
life
what
you should eat
nor
for the
body
what
you should put on
The
for
life
more than
is
the
food
and
the
body
than the
clothing
Consider
the
ravens
that
not
they sow
nor
reap
to them
not
there is
a storehouse
nor
barn
and
-
God
feeds
them
How much
more
you
are valuable
than the
birds
Which
now
of
you
being anxious
is able
to
the
lifespan
of him
to add
one hour
If
then
not even
[the] least
you are able [to do]
why
about
the
rest
are you anxious
Consider
the
lilies
how
Not
do they labor
nor
do they spin
I say
however
to you
not even
Solomon
in
all
the
glory
of him
was arrayed
as
one
of these
If
however
in [the]
field
the
grass
being [here]
today
and
tomorrow
into
the furnace
being thrown
-
God
thus
clothes
how much
more
you
O [you] of little faith
And
you
not
seek
what
you might eat
and
what
you might drink
and
not
be in suspense
these things
for
all
the
nations
of the
world
seek after
of you
now
the
Father
knows
that
you have need
of these
But
seek you
the
kingdom
of Him
and
these things
will be added
to you
Not
fear
-
little
flock
for
took delight
the
Father
of you
to give
you
the
kingdom
Sell
the
possessions
of you
and
give
alms
make
to yourselves
purses
not
growing old
a treasure
unfailing
in
the
heavens
where
thief
not
does draw near
nor
moth
destroy
Where
for
is
the
treasure
of you
there
also
the
heart
of you
will be
Let be
your
-
waist
girded about
and
the
lamps
burning
and
you
like
to men
waiting for
the
master
of themselves
whenever
he shall return
from
the
wedding feasts
that
having come
and
having knocked
immediately
they might open
to him
Blessed [are]
the
servants
those
whom
having come
the
master
will find
watching
Truly
I say
to you
that
he will gird himself
and
will make recline
them
and
having come up
will serve
them
And if
in
the
second
and if
in
the
third
watch
he comes
and
finds [them]
thus
blessed
are
those
This
however
know
that
if
had known
the
master of the house
in what
hour
the
thief
is coming
not
-
he would have allowed
to be broken into
the
house
of him
Also
you
be
ready
for
in the
hour
not
you expect
the
Son
-
of Man
comes
Said
then
-
Peter
Lord
to
us
the
parable
this
speak You
or
also
to
all
And
said
the
Lord
Who
then
is
the
faithful
manager
[and] the
wise
whom
will set
the
master
over
the
care [of servants]
of him
-
to give [them]
in
season
the
measure of food
Blessed [is]
the
servant
that
whom
having come
the
master
of him
will find
doing
thus
Of a truth
I say
to you
that
over
all
the
possessions
of him
he will set
him
If
however
should say
the
servant
that
in
the
heart
of him
Delays
the
master
of Me
to come
and
should begin
to beat
the
men-servants
and
the
maid-servants
to eat
also
and
to drink
and
to get drunk
will come
the
master
of the
servant
that
in
a day
in which
not
he does expect
and
in
an hour
that
not
he knows
and
he will cut in two
him
and
the
place
of him
with
the
unbelievers
will appoint
That
now
-
servant
the [one]
having known
the
will
of the
master
of him
and
not
having prepared
nor
having done
according to
the
will
of him
will be beaten with
many [blows]
the [one]
however
not
having known
having done
however
[things] worthy
of stripes
will be beaten with
few
Everyone
now
to whom
has been given
much
much
will be required
from
him
and
to whom
has been committed
much
the more
will they ask of
him
Fire
I came
to cast
upon
the
earth
and
how
I wish
if
already
it be kindled
Baptism
however
I have
to be baptized [with]
and
how
I am distressed
until
while
it should be accomplished
Think you
that
peace
I came
to give
on
the
earth
No
I say
to you
but
rather
division
There will be
for
from
-
now
five
in
one
house
divided
three
against
two
and
two
against
three
They will be divided
father
against
son
and
son
against
father
mother
against
daughter
and
daughter
against
-
mother
mother-in-law
against
the
daughter-in-law
of her
and
daughter-in-law
against
-
mother-in-law
He was saying
now
also
to the
crowds
When
you see
cloud
rising up
from
[the] west
immediately
you say
-
A shower
is coming
and
it happens
so
And
when
a south wind
is blowing
you say
-
Heat
there will be
and
it happens
Hypocrites
The
appearance
of the
earth
and
of the
sky
you know [how]
to discern
the
time
however
this
how
not
to discern
Why
now
even
for
yourselves
not
judge you
what [is]
right
As
for
you are going
with
the
adversary
of you
before
a magistrate
in
the
way
give
earnestness
to be set free
from
him
lest
ever
he should drag away
you
to
the
judge
and
the
judge
you
will deliver
to the
officer
and
the
officer
you
will cast
into
prison
I say
to you
no
not
shall you come out
from there
until
even
the
last
lepton
you shall have paid
Were present
now
some
at
the same
-
time
telling
Him
about
the
Galileans
of whom
the
blood
Pilate
had mingled
with
the
sacrifices
of them
And
answering
He said
to them
Think you
that
-
Galileans
these
sinners
beyond
all
the
Galileans
were
because
such things
they have suffered
No
I say
to you
but
if
not
you repent
all
likewise
you will perish
Or
those
-
ten [and]
eight
on
whom
fell
the
tower
in
-
Siloam
and
killed
them
think you
that
these
debtors
were
beyond
all
the
men
-
dwelling
in Jerusalem
No
I say
to you
but
if
not
you repent
all
likewise
you will perish
He was speaking
then
this
-
parable
A fig tree
had
a certain [man]
planted
in
the
vineyard
of him
and
he came
seeking
fruit
on
it
and
not
did find [any]
He said
then
to
the
vinedresser
Behold
three
years
throughout
these
I come
seeking
fruit
on
the
fig tree
this
and
not
do find [any]
Cut down
it
that
why
even
the
ground
should it use up
-
And
answering
he says
to him
Sir
let alone
it
also
this
the
year
until
when
I shall dig
around
it
and
put [in]
manure
and if
indeed
it should bear
fruit
in
the [time]
so be it
If
however
not
you will cut down
it
He was
now
teaching
in
one
of the
synagogues
on
the
Sabbaths
And
behold
a woman
a spirit
having
of infirmity
years
ten [and]
eight
And
she was
bent over
and
not
able
to lift up herself
to
the
full
Having seen
then
her
-
Jesus
called [her] near
and
said
to her
Woman
you have been freed from
the
sickness
of you
And
He laid
upon her
the
hands
and
immediately
she was made straight
and
began to glorify
-
God
Answering
now
the
ruler of the synagogue
indignant
because
on the
Sabbath
had healed
-
Jesus
he was saying
to the
crowd
-
Six
days
there are
in
which
it behooves
to work
in
these
therefore
coming
be healed
and
not
on the
day
of the
Sabbath
Answered
therefore
him
the
Lord
and
said
Hypocrites
Each one
of you
on the
Sabbath
not
does he untie
the
ox
of him
or
the
donkey
from
the
stall
and
having led [it] away
give [it] to drink
This
now
a daughter
of Abraham
being
whom
has bound
-
Satan
behold
ten
and
eight
years
not
ought [she]
to be loosed
from
the
bond
this
on the
day
of the
Sabbath
And
these things
on saying
of Him
were ashamed
all
those
opposed
to Him
and
all
the
crowd
was rejoicing
at
all
the
glorious things
that
were being done
by
Him
He was saying
then
To what
like
is
the
kingdom
-
of God
And
to what
shall I liken
it
Like
it is
to a grain
of mustard
which
having taken
a man
cast
into
garden
his
and
it grew
and
came
into
a tree
and
the
birds
of the
air
encamped
in
the
branches
of it
And
again
He said
To what
shall I liken
the
kingdom
-
of God
Like
it is
to leaven
which
having taken
a woman
hid
in
of meal
measures
three
until
it
was leavened
all
And
He was going through
by
towns
and
villages
teaching
and
progress
making
toward
Jerusalem
Said
then
one
to Him
Lord
if
[are] few
those
being saved
-
And
He said
to
them
Strive
to enter in
through
the
narrow
door
for
many
I say
to you
will seek
to enter in
and
not
will be able
From
what
-
shall have risen up
the
master of the house
and
shall have shut
the
door
then
you should begin
outside
to stand
and
to knock
at the
door
saying
Lord
open
to us
And
he answering
will say
to you
Not
I do know
you
from where
are
Then
will you begin
to say
We ate
in presence
of you
and
drank
and
in
the
streets
of us
you taught
And
he will say
I tell
you
not
I do know
from where
you are
depart
from
me
all [you]
workers
of unrighteousness
There
will be
the
weeping
and
the
gnashing
of the
teeth
when
you see
Abraham
and
Isaac
and
Jacob
and
all
the
prophets
in
the
kingdom
-
of God
you
however
are being cast
out
And
they will come
from
east
and
west
and
from
north
and
south
and
will recline
in
the
kingdom
-
of God
And
behold
there are
last
who
will be
first
and
there are
first
who
will be
last
In
same
the
hour
came near
certain
Pharisees
saying
to Him
Go out
and
proceed
from here
for
Herod
desires
You
to kill
And
He said
to them
Having gone
say
to the
fox
that
Behold
I cast out
demons
and
cures
I complete
today
and
tomorrow
and
the
third [day]
I am perfected
But
it behooves
Me
today
and
tomorrow
and
the [day]
following
to proceed
for
not
it is possible [for]
a prophet
to perish
outside of
Jerusalem
Jerusalem
Jerusalem
-
killing
the
prophets
and
stoning
those
having been sent
to
her
how often
I have wanted
to gather
those
children
of you
that
way
a hen [gathers]
-
her
brood
under
the
wings
and
not
you were willing
Behold
is left
to you
the
house
of you
I say
now
to you
no
not
shall you see
Me
until
[the time] comes
when
you say
Blessed is
the [One]
coming
in
[the] name
of [the] Lord
And
it came to pass
on
the
going
of Him
into
a house
of one
of the
rulers
of the
Pharisees
on a Sabbath
to eat
bread
and
they
were
watching
Him
And
behold
a man
certain
there was
with dropsy
before
Him
And
answering
-
Jesus
spoke
to
the
lawyers
and
to [the] Pharisees
saying
Is it lawful
on the
Sabbath
to heal
or
not
-
But
they were silent
And
having taken hold [of him]
He healed
him
and
let [him] go
And
to
them
He said
Which
of you
a son
or
an ox
into
a pit
will fall
also
not
immediately
he will pull up
him
on
day
the
Sabbath
And
not
they were able
to reply
to
these things
He was speaking
then
to
those
having been invited
a parable
remarking
how
the
first places
they were choosing out
saying
to
them
When
you are invited
by
anyone
to
wedding feasts
not
do recline
in
the
first place
lest
ever
[one] more honorable
than you
might have been
invited
by
him
and
having come
the [one]
you
and
him
having invited
will say
to you
Give
to this one
[your] place
and
then
you should begin
with
shame
the
last
place
to take
But
when
you are invited
having gone
recline
in
the
last
place
so that
when
might come
the [one]
having invited
you
he will say
to you
Friend
come up
higher
Then
will be
to you
glory
before
all
those
reclining
[with] you
For
everyone
-
exalting
himself
will be humbled
and
the [one]
humbling
himself
will be exalted
He was saying
then
also
to the [one]
having invited
Him
When
you make
a dinner
or
a supper
not
call
-
friends
of you
nor
the
brothers
of you
nor
the
relatives
of you
nor
neighbors
rich
lest
ever
also
they
should invite in return
you
and
be made
recompense
to you
But
when
a feast
you make
call
the poor
the crippled
the lame
the blind
and
blessed
you will be
because
nothing
they have
to repay
you
It will be recompensed
for
to you
in
the
resurrection
of the
righteous
Having heard
then
one
of those
reclining with [Him]
these things
he said
to Him
Blessed [is he]
who
will eat
bread
in
the
kingdom
-
of God
-
But
He said
to him
A man
certain
was preparing
a supper
great
and
invited
many
And
he sent
the
servant
of him
at the
hour
of the
supper
to say
to those
having been invited
Come
for
now
ready
[it] is
And
began
with
one [voice]
all
to excuse themselves
The
first
said
to him
A field
I have bought
and
I have
need
going out
to see
it
I beg of
you
hold
me
excused
And
another
said
Yoke
of oxen
I have bought
five
and
I am going
to prove
them
I beg of
you
hold
me
excused
And
another
said
A wife
I have married
and
because of
this
not
I am able
to come
And
having come
the
servant
reported
to the
master
of him
these things
Then
having become angry
the
master of the house
said
to
servant
of him
Go out
quickly
into
the
streets
and
lanes
of the
city
and
the
poor
and
crippled
and
blind
and
lame
bring in
here
And
said
the
servant
Sir
it has been done
as
you did command
and
still
room
there is
And
said
the
master
to
the
servant
Go out
into
the
highways
and
hedges
and
compel [them]
to come in
so that
may be filled
of me
the
house
I say
for
to you
that
not one
the
men
of those
-
having been invited
will taste
of me
the
supper
Were going with
then
Him
crowds
great
and
having turned
He said
to
them
If
anyone
comes
to
Me
and
not
hates
the
father
of himself
and
the
mother
and
the
wife
and
the
children
and
the
brothers
and
the
sisters
yes
and
even
the
life
of him
not
he is able
to be
of Me
disciple
Whoever
not
carries
the
cross
of himself
and
comes
after
Me
not
is able
to be
My
disciple
Which
for
of
you
desiring
a tower
to build
not
first
having sat down
counts
the
cost
whether
he has
for
[its] completion
Thus
not
ever
he having laid
of it
a foundation
and
not
being able
to finish
all
-
seeing [it]
may begin
him
to mock
saying
-
This
-
man
began
to build
and
not
was able
to finish
Or
what
king
proceeding
with another
king
to engage
in
war
not
having sat down
first
will take counsel
whether
able
he is
with
ten
thousand
to meet
the [one]
with
twenty
thousand
coming
against
him
If
now
not
still
of him
far off
being
an embassy
having sent
he asks
-
for
peace
So
therefore
every one
of
you
who
not
does give up
all
that
he himself
possesses
not
is able
to be
My
disciple
Good [is]
therefore
the
salt
if
however
even
the
salt
becomes tasteless
with
what
will it be seasoned
Neither
for
soil
nor
for
manure
fit
is it
out
they cast
it
The [one]
having
ears
to hear
let him hear
Were
now
to Him
drawing near
all
the
tax collectors
and
the
sinners
to hear
Him
And
were grumbling
the
both
Pharisees
and
the
scribes
saying
-
This [man]
sinners
receives
and
eats with
them
He spoke
then
to
them
the
parable
this
saying
What
man
of
you
having
a hundred
sheep
and
having lost
of
them
one
not
leaves
the
ninety
nine
in
the
open field
and
goes
after
the [one]
having been lost
until
he finds
it
And
having found [it]
he lays [it]
on
the
shoulders
of him
rejoicing
And
having come
to
the
house
he calls together
the
friends
and
the
neighbors
saying
to them
Rejoice with
me
for
I have found
the
sheep
of me
the [one]
having been lost
I say
to you
that
in the same way
joy
in
-
heaven
there will be
over
one
sinner
repenting
rather than
over
ninety
nine
righteous ones
who
no
need
have
of repentance
Or
what
woman
drachmas
having
ten
if
she should lose
drachma
one
not
lights
a lamp
and
sweeps
the
house
and
seeks
carefully
until
it
she finds
And
having found [it]
she calls together
the
friends
and
neighbors
saying
Rejoice with
me
for
I have found
the
drachma
that
I lost
Thus
I say
to you
there is
joy
before
the
angels
-
of God
over
one
sinner
repenting
He said
then
A man
certain
had
two
sons
And
said
the
younger
of them
to
[the] father
Father
give
to me
the
falling [to me]
portion
of the
property
-
And
he divided
between them
the
property
And
after
not
many
days
having gathered together
all
the
younger
son
went away
into
a country
distant
and
there
he wasted
the
estate
of him
living
prodigally
Having spent
however
of him
all
there arose
a famine
severe
throughout
the
country
that
and
he
began
to be in need
And
having gone
he joined himself
to one
of the
citizens
the
country
of that
and
he sent
him
into
the
fields
of him
to feed
pigs
And
he was longing
to fill
the
belly
of him
from
the
pods
that
were eating
the
pigs
and
no one
was giving
to him
To
himself
however
having come
he was saying
How many
hired servants
of the
father
of me
have abundance
of bread
I
however
with hunger
here
am perishing
Having risen up
I will go
to
the
father
of me
and
I will say
to him
Father
I have sinned
against
-
heaven
and
before
you
no longer
am I
worthy
to be called
son
of you
Make
me
like
one
of the
servants
of you
And
having risen up
he went
to
the
father
of himself
Still
now
he
far
being distant
saw
him
the
father
of him
and
was moved with compassion
and
having run
fell
upon
the
neck
of him
and
kissed
him
Said
then
the
son
to him
Father
I have sinned
against
-
heaven
and
before
you
no longer
am I
worthy
to be called
son
of you
Said
then
the
father
to
the
servants
of him
Quickly
bring out
robe
the
best
and
clothe
him
and
give
a ring
for
the
hand
of him
and
sandals
for
his
feet
and
having brought
the
calf
-
fattened
kill [it]
and
having eaten
let us be merry
For
this
-
son
of mine
dead
was
and
is alive again
he was
lost
and
is found
And
they began
to be merry
Was
now
the
son
of him
the
elder
in
[the] field
and
while
coming [up]
he drew near
to the
house
he heard
music
and
dancing
And
having called near
one
of the
servants
he began inquiring
what
-
might be
these things
-
And
he said
to him
-
The
brother
of you
is come
and
has killed
the
father
of you
the
calf
-
fattened
because
in good health
him
he has received
He was angry
however
and
not
was willing
to go in
-
And
the father
of him
having gone
was begging
him
-
And
answering
he said
to
[the] father
Behold
so many
years
I serve
you
and
never
a commandment
of you
I disobeyed
and
to me
never
did you give
a young goat
that
with
the
friends
of me
I might make merry
When
however
the
son
of you
this
the [one]
having devoured
your
-
living
with
prostitutes
came
you have killed
for him
the
fattened
calf
-
And
he said
to him
Son
you
always
with
me
are
and
all
that
[is] mine
yours
is
To make merry
however
and
to rejoice
it was fitting
because
the
brother
of you
this
dead
was
and
is alive again
and
he was lost
and
is found
He was saying
now
also
to
the
disciples
A man
certain
there was
rich
who
had
a manager
and
he
was accused
unto him
as
is wasting
the
possessions
of him
And
having called
him
he said
to him
What [is]
this
I hear
concerning
you
Give
the
account
of the
stewardship
of you
not
for
you are able
any longer
to manage
Said
then
within
himself
the
manager
What
shall I do
for
the
master
of me
is taking away
the
management
from
me
To dig
not
I am able
to beg
I am ashamed
I know
what
I will do
so that
when
I shall have been removed
from
the
management
they might receive
me
into
the
homes
of them
And
having called to [him]
one
each
of the
debtors
of the
master
of him
he was saying
to the
first
How much
owe you
to
master
of me
-
And
he said
A hundred
baths
of oil
-
And
he said
to him
Take
your
the
bill
and
having sat down
quickly
write
fifty
Then
to another
he said
You
now
how much
owe
-
And
he said
A hundred
cors
of wheat
He says
to him
Take
your
-
bill
and
write
eighty
And
praised
the
master
the
manager
-
unrighteous
because
shrewdly
he had acted
For
the
sons
of the
age
this
more shrewd
than
the
sons
of the
light
in
the
generation
-
of themselves
are
And
I
to you
say
for yourselves
make
friends
by
the
wealth
-
of unrighteousness
that
when
it fails
they might receive
you
into
the
eternal
dwellings
The [one]
faithful
with
very little
also
with
much
faithful
is
and
the [one]
with
very little
unrighteous
also
with
much
unrighteous
is
If
therefore
in
the
unrighteous
wealth
faithful
not
you have been
the
true [riches]
who
to you
will entrust
And
if
in
that which [is]
of another
faithful
not
you have been
that which
[is] yours
who
will give
to you
No
servant
is able
two
masters
to serve
either
for
the
one
he will hate
and
the
other
he will love
or
one
he will be devoted to
and
the
other
he will despise
Not
you are able
God
to serve
and
money
Were listening to
now
these things
all
the
Pharisees
lovers of money
being
and
they were ridiculing
Him
And
He said
to them
You
are
those
justifying
themselves
before
-
men
-
but
God
knows
the
hearts
of you
for
that which
among
men
[is] exalted
[is] an abomination
before
-
God
The
law
and
the
prophets [were]
until
John
from
that time
the
kingdom
-
of God
is proclaimed
and
everyone
into
it
forces his way
Easier for
however
it is
the
heaven
and
the
earth
to pass away
than
of the
law
one
stroke of a pen
to fail
Everyone
-
putting away
the
wife
of him
and
marrying
another
commits adultery
And
the [one]
her put away
from
a husband
marrying
commits adultery
A man
now
certain
there was
rich
and
he was clothed in
purple
and
fine linen
making good cheer
every
day
in splendor
A poor man
now
certain
named
Lazarus
was laid
at
the
gate
of him
being full of sores
and
desiring
to be fed
from
that
falling
from
the
table
of the
rich man
but
even
the
dogs
coming
were licking
the
sores
of him
It came to pass that
then
died
the
poor man
and
was carried away
he
by
the
angels
into
the
bosom
of Abraham
Died
then
also
the
rich man
and
was buried
And
in
-
Hades
having lifted up
the
eyes
of him
being
in
torment
he sees
Abraham
from
afar
and
Lazarus
in
the
bosom
of him
And
he
having cried out
said
Father
Abraham
have mercy on
me
and
send
Lazarus
that
he might dip
the
tip
of the
finger
of him
in water
and
cool
the
tongue
of me
for
I am suffering
in
the
flame
this
Said
then
Abraham
Child
remember
that
you did fully receive
the [things]
good
of you
in
the
lifetime
of you
and
Lazarus
likewise
the [things]
evil
Now
however
here
he is comforted
you
now
are suffering
And
besides
all
these things
between
us
and
you
a chasm
great
has been fixed
so that
those
desiring
to pass
from here
to
you
not
are able
nor
from there
to
us
can they pass
He said
then
I implore
you
then
father
that
you would send
him
to
the
house
of the
father
of me
I have
for
five
brothers
so that
he might warn
them
that
not
also
they
might come
to
the
place
this
-
of torment
Says
however
Abraham
They have
Moses
and
the
prophets
let them hear
them
-
And
he said
No
father
Abraham
but
if
one
from
[the] dead
should go
to
them
they will repent
He said
however
to him
If
Moses
and
the
prophets
not
they hear
not even
if
one
out from
[the] dead
should rise
will they be persuaded
He said
then
to
the
disciples
of Him
Impossible
it is
for
the
stumbling blocks
not
to come
woe [to him]
but
by
whom
they come
It is better
for him
if
a stone
of a mill
is hung
around
the
neck
of him
and
he is thrown
into
the
sea
than
that
he should cause to stumble
-
little
of these
one
Take heed
to yourselves
If
should sin
the
brother
of you
rebuke
him
and
if
he should repent
forgive
him
And
if
seven times
in the
day
he should sin
against
you
and
seven times
should return
to
you
saying
I repent
you shall forgive
him
And
said
the
apostles
to the
Lord
Add
to us
faith
Said
then
the
Lord
If
you have
faith
like
a grain
of mustard
you would have said
-
to the
mulberry tree
this
Be uprooted
and
be planted
in
the
sea
and
it would have obeyed
-
you
Which
now
of
you
a servant
having
plowing
or
shepherding
the [one]
having come in
out of
the
field
will say
to him
Immediately
having come
recline
But
not
will he say
to him
Prepare
what
I may eat
and
having girded yourself about
serve
me
while
I eat
and
drink
and
after
these things
shall eat
and
drink
you
Not
is he
thankful
to the
servant
because
he did
the things
having been commanded
Thus
also
you
when
you may have done
all
the [things]
having been commanded
you
say
-
Servants
unworthy
are we
that which
we were bound
to do
we have done
And
it came to pass
in
the
going up
to
Jerusalem
that
He
was passing
through
[the] midst
of Samaria
and
Galilee
And
on entering
of Him
into
a certain
village
met
ten
leprous
men
who
stood
afar off
And
they
lifted up
[their] voice
saying
Jesus
Master
have compassion on
us
And
having seen [them]
He said
to them
Having gone
show
yourselves
to the
priests
And
it came to pass
in
the
going
them
they were cleansed
One
then
of
them
having seen
that
he was healed
turned back
with
a voice
loud
glorifying
-
God
and
he fell
on
[his] face
at
the
feet
of Him
giving thanks
to Him
and
he
was
a Samaritan
Having answered
then
-
Jesus
said
Not
the
ten
were cleansed
-
But
the nine
are where
None
was there found
having returned
to give
glory
-
to God
if
not
the
foreigner
this
And
He said
to him
Having risen up
go forth
the
faith
of you
has cured
you
Having been asked
now
by
the
Pharisees
when
is coming
the
kingdom
-
of God
He answered
them
and
said
Not
comes
the
kingdom
-
of God
with
careful observation
nor
will they say
Behold
here
or
There
Behold
for
the
kingdom
-
of God
in the midst
of you
is
He said
then
to
the
disciples
Will come
days
when
you will desire
one
of the
days
of the
Son
-
of Man
to see
and
not
you will see [it]
And
they will say
to you
Behold
there
Behold
here
Not
go forth
nor
follow
As
for
the
lightning
flashing
from
the [one end]
of
the
sky
to
the [other end]
of the
sky
shines
thus
will be
the
Son
-
of Man
in
the
day
of Him
First
however
it behooves
Him
many things
to suffer
and
to be rejected
by
the
generation
this
And
as
it came to pass
in
the
days
of Noah
thus
will it be
also
in
the
days
of the
Son
of
man
They were eating
they were drinking
they were marrying
they were being given in marriage
until
that
day
entered
Noah
into
the
ark
and
came
the
flood
and
destroyed
all
Likewise
as
it came to pass
in
the
days
of Lot
they were eating
they were drinking
they were buying
they were selling
they were planting
they were building
in that
then
day
went out
Lot
from
Sodom
it rained
fire
and
brimstone
from
heaven
and
destroyed
all
According
-
to these
will it be
in that
day
the
Son
-
of Man
is revealed
In
that
-
day
the [one who]
will be
on
the
housetop
and
the
goods
of him
in
the
house
not
let him come down
to take away
them
and
the [one]
in
[the] field
likewise
not
let him return
to
the things
behind
Remember
the
wife
of Lot
Whoever
if
may seek
the
life
of him
to save
will lose
it
also
whoever
-
will lose [it]
will preserve
it
I say
to you
in that
-
night
there will be
two
upon
bed
one
The
one
will be taken
and
the
other
will be left
There will be
two [women]
grinding
at
the
same [place]
The
one
will be taken
-
and
the other
will be left
And
answering
they say
to Him
Where
Lord
-
And
He said
to them
Where
the
body [is]
there
also
the
vultures
will be gathered together
He was speaking
then
a parable
to them
about
the [way]
it behooves
always
to pray
them
and
not
to lose heart
saying
A judge
certain
there was
in
a certain
city
-
God
not
fearing
and
man
not
respecting
A widow
then
there was
in
the
city
that
and
she was coming
to
him
saying
Avenge
me
of
the
adversary
of me
And
not
he would
for
a time
afterward
he
however
said
within
himself
If
even
-
God
not
I fear
nor
man
respect
because
yet
-
causes
me
trouble
the
widow
this
I will avenge
her
so that
not
to
end
coming
she exhaust
me
Said
then
the
Lord
Hear
what
the
judge
-
unrighteous
says
-
And
God
no
not
shall execute
the
avenging
of the
elect
of Him
the [ones]
crying out
to Him
day
and
night
and
be deferring
in regard to
them
I say
to you
that
He will execute
the
avenging
of them
in
quickness
Nevertheless
the
Son
-
of Man
having come
indeed
will He find
-
faith
on
the
earth
He spoke
now
also
to
some
-
trusting
in
themselves
that
they are
righteous
and
despising
the
others
the
parable
this
Men
two
went up
into
the
temple
to pray
the
one
a Pharisee
and
the
other
a tax collector
The
Pharisee
having stood
thus
toward
himself
was praying
-
God
I thank
You
that
not
I am
like
the
rest
of the
men
swindlers
unrighteous
adulterers
or
even
like
this
-
tax collector
I fast
twice
in the
week
I tithe
all things
as many as
I gain
-
But
the tax collector
afar off
standing
not
was willing
not even
the
eyes
to lift up
to
-
heaven
but
was striking
the
breast
of himself
saying
-
God
be merciful
to me
the
sinner
I say
to you
went down
this one
justified
to
the
house
of him
rather than
that
For
everyone
-
exalting
himself
will be humbled
the [one]
however
humbling
himself
will be exalted
They were bringing
then
to Him
also
the
infants
that
them
He might touch
having seen
however
the
disciples
were rebuking
them
-
But
Jesus
having called to [Him]
them
said
Permit
the
little children
to come
to
Me
and
not
do forbid
them
of the
for
such
is
the
kingdom
-
of God
Truly
I say
to you
whoever
-
not
shall receive
the
kingdom
-
of God
as
a child
no
not
shall enter
into
it
And
asked
a certain
Him
ruler
saying
Teacher
good
what
having done
life
eternal
will I inherit
Said
then
to him
-
Jesus
Why
Me
call you
good
No one [is]
good
if
not
alone

God
The
commandments
You know
Not
shall you commit adultery
not
shall you murder
not
shall you steal
not
shall you bear false witness
you shall honor
the
father
of you
and
the
mother
-
And
he said
These
all
have I kept
from
[the] youth
Having heard
then
-
Jesus
said
to him
Yet
one thing
to you
is lacking
All
as much as
you have
sell
and
distribute
to [the] poor
and
you will have
treasure
in
the
heavens
and
come
follow
Me
-
And
having heard
these things
very sorrowful
he became
he was
for
rich
extremely
Having seen
then
him
-
Jesus
saying
How
difficultly
those
-
riches
having
into
the
kingdom
-
of God
shall enter
Easier
for
it is
a camel
through
an eye
of a needle
to go
than
a rich man
into
the
kingdom
-
of God
to enter
Said
then
those
having heard
Then
who
is able
to be saved
-
But
He said
The things
impossible
with
men
possible
with
-
God
are
Said
then
-
Peter
Behold
we
having left
the
own
followed
You
-
And
He said
to them
Truly
I say
to you
that
no one
there is
who
has left
house
or
wife
or
brothers
or
parents
or
children
for the sake of
the
kingdom
-
of God
who
no
nothing
shall receive
manifold more
in
the
time
this
and
in
the
age
that
is coming
life
eternal
Having taken aside
then
the
Twelve
He said
to
them
Behold
we go up
to
Jerusalem
and
will be accomplished
all things
-
having been written
by
the
prophets
about the
Son
-
of Man
He will be betrayed
for
to the
Gentiles
and
will be mocked
and
will be insulted
and
will be spit upon
And
having flogged [Him]
they will kill
Him
and
on the
day
-
third
He will rise again
And
they
none
of these things
understood
and
was
the
word
this
hidden
from
them
and
neither
they knew
the things
being spoken
It came to pass
then
in
the
drawing near
of Him
to
Jericho
a blind [man]
certain
was sitting
beside
the
road
begging
Having heard
now
a crowd
passing along
he was asking
what
might be
this
They told
then
him
-
Jesus
of
Nazareth
is passing by
And
he called out
saying
Jesus
Son
of David
have mercy on
me
And
those
going before
were rebuking
him
that
he should be silent
He
however
much
more
kept crying out
Son
of David
have mercy on
me
Having stopped
then
-
Jesus
commanded
him
to be brought
to
Him
Having drawn near
then
him
He asked
him
What
to you
desire you
I shall do
-
And
he said
Lord
that
I might receive sight
And
-
Jesus
said
to him
Receive sight
The
faith
of you
has healed
you
And
immediately
he received sight
and
began following
Him
glorifying
-
God
And
all
the
people
having seen [it]
gave
praise
-
to God
And
having entered
He was passing through
-
Jericho
And
behold
a man
by name
called
Zacchaeus
and
he
was
a chief tax collector
and
he [was]
rich
And
he was seeking
to see
-
Jesus
who
He is
and
not
he was able
because of
the
crowd
because
-
in stature
small
he was
And
having run
to
the
front
he went up
into
a sycamore-fig tree
so that
he might see
Him
for
that [way]
He was about
to pass
And
as
He came
to
the
place
having looked up
-
Jesus
said
to
him
Zacchaeus
having hurried
come down
today
for
in
the
house
of you
it behooves
Me
to stay
And
having hurried
he came down
and
received
Him
rejoicing
And
having seen [it]
all
were grumbling
saying
-
With
a sinful
man
He has entered
to stay
Having stood
then
Zacchaeus
said
to
the
Lord
Behold
the
half
of me
of the
possessions
Lord
to the
poor
I give
and
if
of anyone
anything
I have defrauded
I restore [it]
fourfold
Said
then
to
him
-
Jesus
-
Today
salvation
to the
house
this
has come
because
also
he
a son
of Abraham
is
Came
for
the
Son
-
of Man
to seek
and
to save
that
having been lost
Were hearing
while
they
these things
having proceeded
He spoke
a parable
because
-
near
being
Jerusalem
of His
and
thinking
their
that
immediately
is about
the
kingdom
-
of God
to appear
He said
therefore
A man
certain
of noble birth
proceeded
to
a country
distant
to receive
for himself
a kingdom
and
to return
Having called
then
ten
servants
of himself
he gave
to them
ten
minas
and
said
to
them
Do business
until
that
I come back
-
But
the citizens
of him
hated
him
and
sent
a delegation
after
him
saying
Not
we are willing [for]
this [man]
to reign
over
us
And
it came to pass
on
the
returning
of him
having received
the
kingdom
that
he directed
to be called
to him
the
servants
these
to whom
he had given
the
money
in order that
he might know
each
what
had gained by trading
Came up
then
the
first
saying
Lord
the
mina
of you
ten
has produced
more minas
And
He said
to him
Well done
good
servant
Because
in
very little
faithful
you were
to be
having authority
you are
over
ten
cities
And
came
the
second
saying
The
mina
of you
Lord
has made
five
minas
He said
then
also
to this one
And
you
over
are to be
five
cities
And
-
another
came
saying
Lord
behold
the
mina
of you
which
I kept
lying away
in
a piece of cloth
I was afraid
for
of you
because
a man
harsh
you are
You take up
what
not
you did lay down
and
you reap
what
not
you did sow
He says
to him
Out of
the
mouth
of you
I will judge
you
evil
servant
You knew
that
I
a man
harsh
am
taking up
what
not
I did lay down
and
reaping
what
not
I did sow
Then
because of
why
not
did you give
of me
the
money
to
[the] bank
and I
having come
with
interest
-
it
might have collected
And
to those
standing by
he said
Take
from
him
the
mina
and
give [it]
to the [one]
the
ten
minas
having
And
they said
to him
Master
he has
ten
minas
I say
to you
that
to everyone
-
having
will be given
from
however
the [one]
not
having
even
that which
he has
will be taken away
Furthermore
the
enemies
of mine
these
those
not
having been willing [for]
me
to reign
over
them
bring
here
and
slay
them
before
me
And
having said
these things
He went on
ahead
going up
to
Jerusalem
And
it came to pass
as
He drew near
to
Bethphage
and
Bethany
toward
the
mount
-
called
Olivet
He sent
two
of the
disciples
saying
Go
into
the
ahead
village
in
which
entering
you will find
a colt
having been tied
on
which
no one
ever yet
of men
has sat
and
having untied
it
bring [it]
And
if
anyone
you
asks
Because of
why
do you untie [it]
thus
will you say
Because
the
Lord
of it
need
has
Having departed
then
those
having been sent
found [it]
as
He had said
to them
On untying
then
of them
the
colt
said
the
masters
of it
to
them
Why
untie you
the
colt
-
And
they said
-
The
Lord
of it
need
has
And
they led
it
to
-
Jesus
and
having cast
their
-
garments
on
the
colt
they put on [it]
-
Jesus
Going
then
of Him
they were spreading
the
garments
of them
on
the
road
Drawing near
then
of Him
already
at
the
descent
of the
Mount
-
of Olives
began
all
the
multitude
of the
disciples
rejoicing
to praise
-
God
in a voice
loud
for
all
which
they had seen
[the] mighty works
saying
Blessed is
the
coming
-
King
in
[the] name
of [the] Lord
In
heaven
peace
and
glory
in
[the] highest
And
some
of the
Pharisees
from
the
crowd
said
to
Him
Teacher
rebuke
the
disciples
of You
And
answering
He said
I say
to you
if
these
will be silent
the
stones
will cry out
And
as
He drew near
having seen
the
city
He wept
over
it
saying
-
If
you had known
in
the
day
this
even
you
the things
for
peace
Now
however
they are hidden
from
eyes
of you
For
will come
days
upon
you
that
will cast around
the
enemies
of you
a barricade
you
and
they will surround
you
and
will hem in
you
on every side
and
will level to the ground
you
and
the
children
of you
within
you
and
not
will leave
a stone
upon
a stone
within
you
in place of
which
not
you knew
the
season
the
of visitation
of you
And
having entered
into
the
temple
He began
to cast out
those
selling
saying
to them
It has been written
And
will be
the
house
of Me
a house
of prayer
You
however
it
have made
a den
of robbers
And
He was
teaching
-
every
day
in
the
temple
the
however
chief priests
and
the
scribes
were seeking
Him
to destroy
and
the
foremost
of the
people
And
not
they found
-
what
they might do
the
people
for
all
were hanging on
His [words]
listening
And
it came to pass
on
one
of the
days
as was teaching
He
the
people
in
the
temple
and
proclaiming the gospel
came up
the
chief priests
and
the
scribes
with
the
elders
and
spoke
saying
to
Him
Tell
us
by
what
authority
these things
You do
or
who
is
the [one]
having given
to You
the
authority
this
Answering
now
He said
to
them
Will ask
you
I also
one thing
and
you tell
Me
The
baptism
of John
from
heaven
was it
or
from
men
-
And
they reasoned
among
themselves
saying
-
If
we should say
From
heaven
He will say
Because of
why
not
did you believe
him
If
however
we should say
From
men
the
people
all
will stone
us
having been persuaded
for
they are
John
a prophet
to be
And
they answered
not
they knew
from where
And
-
Jesus
said
to them
Neither
I
tell
you
by
what
authority
these things
I am doing
He began
then
to
the
people
to speak
the
parable
this
A man
planted
a vineyard
and
rented
it
to farmers
and
went abroad
a time
long
And
[in the] season
he sent
to
the
farmers
a servant
that
from
the
fruit
of the
vineyard
they will give
to him
-
But
the farmers
sent away
him
having beaten [him]
empty-handed
And
he proceeded
another
to send
a servant
-
but
him
having beaten
and
having dishonored
they sent away
empty-handed
And
he proceeded
a third
to send
-
then
also
him
having wounded
they cast out
Said
then
the
master
of the
vineyard
What
shall I do
I will send
the
son
of me
the
beloved
perhaps
him
they will respect
Having seen
now
him
the
farmers
began reasoning
among
themselves
saying
This
is
the
heir
let us kill
him
so that
ours
might become
the
inheritance
And
having cast forth
him
outside
the
vineyard
they killed [him]
What
therefore
will do
to them
the
master
of the
vineyard
He will come
and
will destroy
the
farmers
these
and
will give
the
vineyard
to others
Having heard [it]
then
they said
Never
may it be
-
But
having looked at
them
He said
What
then
is
that
has been written
this
[The] stone
which
rejected
those
building
this
has become
into
[the] head
of [the] corner
Everyone
-
falling
on
that
-
stone
will be broken
on
whomever
but
-
it might fall
it will grind into powder
him
And
sought
the
scribes
and
the
chief priests
to lay
on
Him
-
hands
in
that
-
hour
and
they feared
the
people
they perceived
for
that
against
them
He was speaking
the
parable
this
And
having watched [Him]
they sent
spies
feigning
themselves
righteous
to be
that
they might catch
Him
in talk
in order
to deliver
Him
to the
rule
and
to the
authority
of the
governor
And
they questioned
Him
saying
Teacher
we know
that
rightly
You speak
and
teach
and
not
receive
[any] person
but
on the basis of
truth
the
way
-
of God
teach
Is it lawful
for us
to Caesar
tribute
to give
or
not
Having perceived
however
of them
the
craftiness
He said
to
them
Show
Me
a denarius
Of whom
has it
[the] image
and
inscription
-
And
they said
Caesarâs
-
And
He said
to
them
Therefore
give back
the things
of Caesar
to Caesar
and
the things
-
of God
-
to God
And
not
they were able
to catch Him in
His
word
before
the
people
and
having marveled
at
the
answer
of Him
they became silent
Having approached
then
some
of the
Sadducees
the ones
denying
a resurrection
not
there is
they questioned
Him
saying
Teacher
Moses
wrote
to us
if
anyoneâs
brother
should die
having
a wife
and
he
childless
is
that
should take
the
brother
of him
the
wife
and
should raise up
seed
to the
brother
of him
Seven
therefore
brothers
there were
and
the
first
having taken
a wife
died
childless
and
the
second
and
the
third
took
her
likewise
then
also
the
seven
not
did leave
children
and
died
Finally
also
the
woman
died
The
woman
therefore
in
the
resurrection
of which
of them
does she become
wife
-
For
the seven
had
her
as wife
And
said
to them
-
Jesus
The
sons
of the
age
this
marry
and
are given in marriage
those
however
having been considered worthy
to the
age
that which [is]
to obtain
and
the
resurrection
which [is]
out from
[the] dead
neither
marry
nor
are given in marriage
neither
for
to die
any more
are they able
like [the] angels
for
they are
and
sons
they are
of God
of the
resurrection
sons
being
That
however
are raised
the
dead
even
Moses
showed
at
the
bush
when
he calls
[the] Lord
the
God
of Abraham
and
God
of Isaac
and
God
of Jacob
God
now
not
He is
of [the] dead
but
of [the] living
all
for
to Him
live
Answering
now
some
of the
scribes
said
Teacher
well
you have spoken
No longer
then
did they dare
to ask
Him
anything
He said
then
to
them
How
do they declare
the
Christ
to be
of David
Son
Himself
for
David
says
in
[the] book
of Psalms
Said
[the] Lord
to the
Lord
of me
Sit
at
[the] right hand
of Me
until
-
I place
the
enemies
of You
[as] a footstool
of the
feet
of You
David
therefore
Him
Lord
calls
and
how
of him
son
is He
Were listening
now
all
the
people
He said
to the
disciples
Beware
of
the
scribes
-
desiring
to walk
in
long robes
and
loving
greetings
in
the
marketplaces
and
first seats
in
the
synagogues
and
first places
in
the
banquets
who
devour
the
houses
of
widows
and
as a pretext
at great length
pray
These
will receive
more abundant
condemnation
Having looked up
now
He saw
the ones
casting
into
the
treasury
the
gifts
of them
rich
He saw
then
a certain
widow
poor
casting
in
lepta
two
And
He said
Truly
I say
to you
that
the
widow
this
-
poor
more
than all
has cast in
all
for
these
out of
that which
was abounding
to them
cast
in
the
gifts
she
however
out of
the
poverty
of her
all
the
livelihood
that
she had
did cast
And
as some
were speaking
about
the
temple
that
with stones
goodly
and
consecrated gifts
it was adorned
He said
[As to] these things
which
you are beholding
will come
[the] days
in
which
not
will be left
stone
upon
stone
which
not
will be thrown down
They asked
then
Him
saying
Teacher
when
then
these things
will be
and
what [will be]
the
sign
when
are about
these things
to take place
-
And
He said
Take heed
lest
you be led astray
many
for
will come
in
the
name
of Me
saying
I
am [He]
and
The
time
is drawn near
Not
go
after
them
When
then
you should hear of
wars
and
commotions
not
be terrified
it behooves
for
these things
to take place
first
but
not
immediately [is]
the
end
Then
He was saying
to them
Will rise up
nation
against
nation
and
kingdom
against
kingdom
Earthquakes
both
great
and
in different
places
famines
and
pestilences
there will be
fearful sights
also
and
from
heaven
signs
great
will there be
Before
however
these things
all
they will lay
upon
you
the
hands
of them
and
will persecute [you]
delivering [you]
to
the
synagogues
and
prisons
bringing [you]
before
kings
and
governors
on account of
the
name
of Me
It will result
to you
for
a testimony
Settle
therefore
in
the
minds
of you
not
to premeditate
to make a defense
I
for
will give
you
a mouth
and
wisdom
which
not
will be able
to resist
nor
to reply to
all
those
opposing
you
You will be betrayed
then
even
by
parents
and
brothers
and
relatives
and
friends
and
they will put to death
[some] from among
you
And
you will be
hated
by
all
because of
the
name
of Me
But
a hair
of
the
head
of you
no
not
should perish
By
the
patient endurance
of you
you will gain
the
souls
of you
When
then
you see
being encircled
by
encampments
Jerusalem
then
know
that
has drawn near
the
desolation
of her
Then
those
in
-
Judea
let them flee
to
the
mountains
and
those
in
midst
of her
let them depart out
and
those
in
the
countries
not
let them enter
into
her
for
[the] days
of avenging
these
are
-
to fulfill
all things
-
having been written
But woe
to those
in
womb
having
and
to the [ones]
nursing
in
those
the
days
there will be
for
distress
great
upon
the
land
and
wrath
to the
people
this
And
they will fall
by [the] edge
of [the] sword
and
will be led captive
into
the
nations
all
and
Jerusalem
will be
trodden down
by
[the] Gentiles
until
that
are fulfilled
[the] times
of [the] Gentiles
And
there will be
signs
in
sun
and
moon
and
stars
and
upon
the
earth
distress
of nations
with
perplexity
[the] roaring
of [the] sea
and
rolling surge
fainting
men
from
fear
and
expectation
of that which
is coming
on the
earth
-
for
the powers
of the
heavens
will be shaken
And
then
will they see
the
Son
-
of Man
coming
in
a cloud
with
power
and
glory
great
Beginning
then
of these things
to come to pass
look up
and
lift up
the
heads
of you
because
draws near
the
redemption
of you
And
He spoke
a parable
to them
Behold
the
fig tree
and
all
the
trees
When
they sprout
already
looking [on them]
for
yourselves
you know
that
already
near
the
summer
is
So
also
you
when
you see
these things
coming to pass
know
that
near
is
the
kingdom
-
of God
Truly
I say
to you
that
no
not
will have passed away
the
generation
this
until
-
all [these things]
shall have taken place
The
heaven
and
the
earth
will pass away
-
but
the words
of Me
no
not
will pass away
Take heed
now
to yourselves
lest
ever
be burdened
of you
the
hearts
with
dissipation
and
drunkenness
and
cares
of life
and
would come
upon
you
suddenly
the
day
that
as
a snare
It will come
for
upon
all
those
sitting
upon
the face
of all
the
earth
Watch
also
at
every
season
praying
that
you may have strength
to escape
these things
all
that
are about
to come to pass
and
to stand
before
the
Son
-
of Man
He was
now
during the
day
in
the
temple
teaching
-
and
the evening
going out
He was lodging
on
the
mount
-
called
Olivet
And
all
the
people
would come early in the morning
to
Him
in
the
temple
to hear
Him
Was drawing near
now
the
Feast
of
Unleavened [Bread]
-
called
Passover
And
were seeking
the
chief priests
and
the
scribes
-
how
they might put to death
him
they were afraid
for
of the
people
Entered
then
Satan
into
Judas
the [one]
being called
Iscariot
being
of
the
number
of the
Twelve
And
having gone away
he spoke with
the
chief priests
and
captains
the
how
to them
he might betray
Him
And
they rejoiced
and
agreed
him
money
to give
And
he promised
and
began seeking
opportunity
-
to betray
Him
apart from
[a] crowd
to them
Came
then
the
day
of
Unleavened [Bread]
which
it was necessary for
to be sacrificed
the
Passover lamb
And
He sent
Peter
and
John
having said
Having gone
prepare
for us
the
Passover
that
we might eat [it]
-
And
they said
to Him
Where
will You
we should prepare
-
And
He said
to them
Behold
having entered
of you
into
the
city
will meet
you
a man
a pitcher
of water
carrying
follow
him
into
the
house
into
which
he enters
and
you shall say
to the
master
of the
house
Says
to you
the
Teacher
Where
is
the
guest room
where
the
Passover
with
the
disciples
of Me
I may eat
And he
you
will show
an upper room
large
furnished
there
prepare
Having gone
then
they found [it]
as
He had said
to them
and
they prepared
the
Passover
And
when
was come
the
hour
He reclined
and
the
apostles
with
Him
And
He said
to
them
With desire
I have desired
this
-
Passover
to eat
with
you
before
-
I
suffer
I say
for
to you
that
no longer
never
not
will I eat
thereof
until
when
it is fulfilled
in
the
kingdom
-
of God
And
having received
[the] cup
having given thanks
He said
Take
this
and
divide [it]
among
yourselves
I say
for
to you
no
not
will I drink
from
-
now
of
the
fruit
of the
vine
until
that
the
kingdom
-
of God
shall come
And
having taken
[the] bread
having given thanks
He broke [it]
and
gave
to them
saying
This
is
the
body
of Me
which
for
you
is given
this
do
in
the
of Me
remembrance
and
the
cup
likewise
after
which
having supped
saying
This
-
cup [is]
the
new
covenant
in
the
blood
of Me
which
for
you
is being poured out
But
behold
the
hand
of him
betraying
Me
[is] with
Me
on
the
table
For
the
Son
indeed
of
man
according to
that
having been determined
goes
but
woe
to the
man
that
by
whom
He is betrayed
And
they
began
to question
among
themselves
-
who
then
it might be
of
them
who
this
is about
to do
There was
then
also
a dispute
among
them
-
which
of them
is thought
to be
[the] greatest
-
And
He said
to them
The
kings
of the
Gentiles
rule over
them
and
those
exercising authority over
them
benefactors
are called
You
however
not
thus [shall be]
Instead
the
greatest
among
you
let him be
as
the
younger
and
the [one]
leading
as
the [one]
serving
Who
for
[is] greater
the [one]
reclining
or
the [one]
serving
[Is] not
the [one]
reclining
I
however
in
[the] midst
of you
am
as
the [One]
serving
You
now
are
those
having remained
with
Me
in
the
trials
of Me
And I
appoint
to you
as
appointed
to Me
the
Father
of Me
a kingdom
so that
you may eat
and
may drink
at
the
table
of Me
in
the
kingdom
of Me
and
may sit
on
thrones
the
twelve
tribes
judging
of
Israel
Simon
Simon
Behold
-
Satan
demanded to have
all of you
-
to sift
like
-
wheat
I
however
begged
for
you
that
not
may fail
the
faith
of you
and
you
when
you have turned back
strengthen
the
brothers
of you
-
And
he said
to Him
Lord
with
You
ready
I am
both
to
prison
and
to
death
to go
-
And
He said
I tell
you
Peter
not
will crow
today
[the] rooster
until
three times
Me
you will deny
not
knowing
And
He said
to them
When
I sent
you
without
purse
and
bag
and
sandals
not
anything
did you lack
-
And
they said
Nothing
He said
then
to them
But
now
the [one]
having
a purse
let him take [it]
likewise
also
a bag
and
the [one]
not
having
let him sell
the
cloak
of him
and
buy [one]
a sword
I say
for
to you
that
this
which
has been written
it behooves
to be accomplished
in
Me
-
And
with
the lawless
He was reckoned
And
for
the things
concerning
Me
an end
have
-
And
they said
Lord
behold
swords
here [are]
two
-
And
He said
to them
Enough
it is
And
having gone forth
He went
according to
the
custom
to
the
Mount
-
of Olives
followed
then
Him
also
the
disciples
Having come
then
to
the
place
He said
to them
Pray
not
to enter
into
temptation
And
He
withdrew
from
them
about
a stoneâs
throw
and
having fallen on
the
knees
He was praying
saying
Father
if
You are willing
take away
this
-
cup
from
Me
Yet
not
the
will
of Me
but
-
of You
be done
Appeared
then
to Him
an angel
from
heaven
strengthening
Him
And
having been
in
agony
more earnestly
He was praying
And
became
the
sweat
of Him
like
great drops
of blood
falling down
upon
the
ground
And
having risen up
from
the
prayer
having come
to
the
disciples
He found
sleeping
them
from
the
grief
and
He said
to them
Why
are you sleeping
Having risen up
pray
that
not
you might enter
into
temptation
While still
of Him
speaking
behold
a crowd
and
he who
is called
Judas
one
of the
Twelve
was going before
them
and
he drew near
-
to Jesus
to kiss
Him
Jesus
then
said
to him
Judas
with a kiss
the
Son
-
of Man
are you betraying
Having seen
then
those
around
Him
what
would be
they said
Lord
if
will we strike
with [the]
sword
And
struck
one
a certain
of
them
of the
high priest
the
servant
and
cut off
the
ear
his
-
right
Answering
now
-
Jesus
said
Allow you
as far as
thus
And
having touched
the
ear
He healed
him
Said
then
Jesus
to
those
having come out
against
Him
chief priests
and
captains
of the
temple
and
elders
As
against
a robber
have you come out
with
swords
and
clubs
Every
day
being
of Me
with
you
in
the
temple
not
did you stretch out
the
hands
against
Me
but
this
is
of you
the
hour
and
the
power
of the
darkness
Having seized
then
Him
they led [Him] away
and
led [Him]
into
the
house
of the
high priest
-
And
Peter
was following
afar off
They having kindled
then
a fire
in
[the] midst
of the
courtyard
and
having sat down together
was sitting
-
Peter
among
them
Having seen
then
him
a servant girl
certain
sitting
by
the
light
and
having looked intently on
him
she said
Also
this one
with
Him
was
-
But
he denied [it]
saying
Not
I do know
Him
woman
And
after
a little
another
having seen
him
was saying
Also
you
of
them
are
-
But
Peter
was saying
Man
not
I am
And
having elapsed
about
hour
one
other
a certain
strongly affirmed [it]
saying
Of
a truth
also
this one
with
Him
was
also
for
a Galilean
he is
Said
however
-
Peter
Man
not
I know
what
you say
And
immediately
while
he was speaking
of him
crowed
the rooster
And
having turned
the
Lord
looked at
-
Peter
and
remembered
-
Peter
the
word
of the
Lord
how
He had said
to him
-
Before
[the] rooster
crows
today
you will deny
Me
three times
And
having gone forth
outside
he wept
bitterly
And
the
men
who
are holding
Him
began mocking
Him
beating [Him]
And
having blindfolded
Him
they were questioning [Him]
saying
Prophesy
who
is
the [one]
having struck
You
And
other things
many
blaspheming
they were saying
to
Him
And
when
it became
day
were gathered together
the
elderhood
of the
people
chief priests
both
and
scribes
and
they led
Him
into
the
council
of them
saying
If
You
are
the
Christ
tell
us
He said
then
to them
If
you
I should tell
no
not
would you believe
if
then
I should ask [you]
no
not
would you answer
From
-
now on
also
will be
the
Son
-
of Man
sitting
at
[the] right hand
of the
power
-
of God
They said
then
all
You
then
are
the
Son
-
of God
-
And
to
them
He was saying
You
say
that
I
am
-
And
they said
What
any more
have we
of witness
need
We ourselves
for
have heard [it]
from
the
mouth
of Him
And
having risen up
all
the
multitude
of them
led
Him
to
-
Pilate
They began
then
to accuse
Him
saying
This [man]
we found
misleading
the
nation
of us
and
forbidding
tribute
to Caesar
to be given
and
declaring
Himself
Christ
a king
to be
-
And
Pilate
questioned
Him
saying
You
are
the
King
of the
Jews
-
And
answering
him
He was saying
You
say
-
And
Pilate
said
to
the
chief priests
and
the
crowds
Not
find I
guilt
in
the
man
this
-
But
they kept insisting
saying
-
He stirs up
the
people
teaching
throughout
all
-
of Judea
and
He has begun
from
-
Galilee
even to
here
Pilate
now
having heard
asked
whether
the
man
a Galilean
is
and
having learned
that
from
the
jurisdiction
of Herod
He is
he sent up
Him
to
Herod
being
also
he himself
in
Jerusalem
in
those
-
days
-
And
Herod
having seen
-
Jesus
[was] glad
exceedingly
he was
for
of
a long
time
wishing
to see
Him
because of
-
hearing
concerning
Him
and
he was hoping
some
sign
to see
by
Him
done
He kept questioning
then
Him
in
words
many
He
however
nothing
answered
him
Had been standing by
now
the
chief priests
and
the
scribes
vehemently
accusing
Him
Having set at naught
then
Him
-
Herod
with
the
troops
of him
and
having mocked [Him]
having put on [Him]
apparel
splendid
sent back
him
to
Pilate
Became
then
friends
-
both
Herod
and
-
Pilate
on
that
-
day
with
one another
previously it had been that
for
at
enmity
they were
between
themselves
Pilate
then
having called together
the
chief priests
and
the
rulers
and
the
people
said
to
them
You brought
to me
the
man
this
as
misleading
the
people
and
behold
I
before
you
having examined [Him]
nothing
found
in
the
man
this
guilty
of that
accusation you are bringing
against
Him
No
not even
Herod [did]
he sent back
for
Him
to
us
And
behold
nothing
worthy
of death
is
done
by Him
Having chastised
therefore
Him
I will release [Him]
They cried out
however
all together
saying
Away with
this [man]
release
now
to us
-
Barabbas
who
was
on account of
insurrection
a certain
having been made
in
the
city
and
murder
having been cast
into
the
prison
Again
therefore
-
Pilate
called
to them
wishing
to release
-
Jesus
-
But
they were crying out
saying
Crucify
crucify
Him
-
And
a third [time]
he said
to
them
What
for
evil
did commit
this [man]
No
cause
of death
found I
in
Him
Having chastised
therefore
Him
I will release [Him]
-
But
they were urgent
with voices
loud
asking for
Him
to be crucified
And
were prevailing
the
voices
of them
and
Pilate
sentenced
to be done
the
demand
of them
He released
then
the [one]
on account of
insurrection
and
murder
having been cast
into
prison
whom
they had asked for
-
and
Jesus
he delivered
to the
will
of them
And
as
they led away
Him
having laid hold on
Simon
a certain
of Cyrene
coming
from
the country
they put upon
him
the
cross
to carry
behind
-
Jesus
Were following
now
Him
a great
multitude
of the
people
and
of women
who
were mourning
and
lamenting for
Him
Having turned
then
to
them
Jesus
said
Daughters
of Jerusalem
not
weep
for
Me
but
for
yourselves
weep
and
for
the
children
of you
For
behold
are coming
days
in
which
they will say
Blessed [are]
the
barren
and
the
wombs
that
never
did bear
and
breasts
that
never
nursed
Then
They will begin
to say
to the
mountains
Fall
upon
us
and
to the
hills
Cover
us
For
if
in
green
tree
these things
they do
in
the
dry
what
might take place
Were being led away
now
also
other
criminals
two
with
Him
to be put to death
And
when
they came
to
the
place
-
called
The Skull
there
they crucified
Him
and
the
criminals
one
-
on [the]
right
one
now
on
[the] left
-
And
Jesus
was saying
Father
forgive
them
not
for
they know
what
they do
Dividing
then
the
garments
of Him
they cast
lots
And
stood
the
people
beholding
Were deriding [Him]
then
also
the
rulers
saying
Others
He saved
let Him save
Himself
if
this
is
the
Christ
-
of God
the
Chosen [One]
Mocked
then
Him
also
the
soldiers
coming near
sour wine
offering
Him
and
saying
If
You
are
the
King
of the
Jews
save
Yourself
There was
now
also
an inscription
over
Him
The
King
of the
Jews
This
One
now
of the
having been hanged
criminals
was railing at
Him
Not
you are
if
the
Christ
Save
Yourself
and
us
Answering
now
the
other
was rebuking
him
saying
Not even
do fear
you
-
God
that
under
the
same
judgment
you are
and
we
indeed
justly
Worthy
for
of what
we did
we are receiving
[this] man
however
nothing
wrong
did
And
he was saying
Jesus
remember
me
when
You come
into
the
kingdom
of You
And
He said
to him
Truly
to you
I say
today
with
Me
you will be
in
-
Paradise
And
it was
now
about
[the] hour
sixth
and
darkness
came
over
all
the
land
until
[the] hour
ninth
The
sun
was darkened
was torn
then
the
veil
of the
temple
in [the] middle
And
having called out
in a voice
loud
-
Jesus
said
Father
into
[the] hands
of You
I commit
the
Spirit
of Me
This
now
having said
He breathed His last
Having seen
now
the
centurion
that
having taken place
he began glorifying
-
God
saying
Certainly
the
man
this
righteous
was
And
all
the
having come together
crowds
to
the
spectacle
this
having seen
the things
having taken place
beating
the
breasts
were returning [home]
Stood
now
all
those who
knew
Him
from
afar off
also
women
those
having followed
Him
from
-
Galilee
beholding
these things
And
behold
a man
named
Joseph
a Council member
being
a man
good
and
righteous
he
not
was
having consented
to the
counsel
and
the
deed
of them
from
Arimathea
a city
of the
Jews
who
was waiting for
the
kingdom
-
of God
He
having gone
-
to Pilate
asked [for]
the
body
-
of Jesus
And
having taken it down
he wrapped
it
in a linen cloth
and
placed
it
in
a tomb
cut in a rock
in which
no
had been
no one
not yet
laid
And
[the] Day
it was
of Preparation
and
Sabbath
was just beginning
Having followed
then
the
women
who
were
come
out of
-
Galilee
with Him
saw
the
tomb
and
how
was laid
the
body
of Him
Having returned
then
they prepared
spices
and
anointing oils
And
on the
indeed
Sabbath
they rested
according to
the
commandment
The
however
first [day]
of the
week
dawn
very early
to
the
tomb
they came
bringing
that
they had prepared
spices
They found
then
the
stone
having been rolled away
from
the
tomb
Having entered
however
not
they found
the
body
of the
Lord
Jesus
And
it came to pass
while
-
are perplexed
they
about
this
that
behold
men
two
stood by
them
in
garments
dazzling
Terrified
then
having become
of them
and
bowing
the
faces
to
the
ground
they said
to
them
Why
seek you
the
living
among
the
dead
Not
He is
here
but
He is risen
Remember
how
He spoke
to you
yet
being
in
-
Galilee
saying
The
Son
-
of Man
-
it behooves
to be delivered
into
hands
of men
sinful
and
to be crucified
and
the
third
day
to arise
And
they remembered
the
words
of Him
And
having returned
from
the
tomb
they related
these things
all
to the
eleven
and
to all
the
rest
It was
now
-
Magdalene
Mary
and
Joanna
and
Mary
the [mother]
of James
and
the
other women
with
them
telling
to
the
apostles
these things
And
appeared
before
them
like
folly
the
words
of them
and
they did not believe
them
-
But
Peter
having risen up
ran
to
the
tomb
and
having stooped down
he sees
the
linen strips
only
and
he went away
in
himself
wondering at
that
having come to pass
And
behold
two
of
them
on
same
the
day
were
going
to
a village
being distant
stadia
sixty
from
Jerusalem
whose
name [is]
Emmaus
and
they
were talking
with
one another
about
all
-
having taken place
these things
And
it came to pass
in
the
talking
of them
and
reasoning
that
Himself
Jesus
having drawn near
was walking along with
them
-
but
the eyes
of them
were held
-
not
to know
Him
He said
then
to
them
What
-
words [are]
these
that
you exchange
with
one another
walking
And
they stood still
looking sad
Answering
now
[the] one
named
Cleopas
said
to
Him
You
alone
visit
Jerusalem
and
not
have known
the things
having come to pass
in
it
in
the
days
these
And
He said
to them
What things
-
And
they said
to Him
The things
concerning
Jesus
of
Nazareth
who
was
a man
a prophet
mighty
in
deed
and
word
before
-
God
and
all
the
people
that
then
delivered up
him
the
chief priests
and
the
rulers
of us
to
[the] judgment
of death
and
crucified
Him
We
however
were hoping
-
He
it is
who
is about
to redeem
-
Israel
But
indeed
also
with
all
these things
[the] third
this
day
brings
away from
which
these things
came to pass
However
also
women
certain
out from
us
astonished
us
Having been
early
to
the
tomb
and
not
having found
the
body
of Him
they came
declaring
also
a vision
of angels
to have seen
who
say
He
is alive
And
went
some
of those
with
us
to
the
tomb
and
found [it]
so
as
also
the
women
said
Him
however
not
they saw
And
He
said
to
them
O
foolish
and
slow
-
of heart
-
to believe
in
all
that
have spoken
the
prophets
Not
these things
was it necessary for
to suffer
the
Christ
and
to enter
into
the
glory
of Him
And
having begun
from
Moses
and
from
all
the
Prophets
He interpreted
to them
in
all
the
Scriptures
the things
concerning
Himself
And
they drew near
to
the
village
where
they were going
and
He
appeared
farther
to be going
And
they constrained
Him
saying
Abide
with
us
for
toward
evening
it is
and
has declined
now
the
day
And
He entered in
-
to abide
with
them
And
it came to pass
in
the
reclining
of Him
with
them
having taken
the
bread
He blessed [it]
and
having broken [it]
He began giving [it]
to them
Of them
then
were opened
the
eyes
and
they knew
Him
And
He
vanished
being seen
from
them
And
they said
to
one another
Not
the
heart
of us
burning
was
within
us
as
He was speaking
with us
on
the
road
as
He was opening
to us
the
Scriptures
And
having risen up
[that] same
-
hour
they returned
to
Jerusalem
and
they found
gathered together
the
eleven
and
those
with
them
saying
-
Indeed
has risen
the
Lord
and
He has appeared
to Simon
And
they
began relating
the things
on
the
road
and
how
He was known
to them
in
the
breaking
of the
bread
These things
now
of them
as they were telling
He Himself
stood
in
midst
of them
and
says
to them
Peace
to you
Having been terrified
however
and
filled with fear
having been
they were thinking [themselves]
a spirit
to see
And
He said
to them
Why
troubled
are you
and
through
why
doubts
do come up
in
the
hearts
of you
See
the
hands
of Me
and
the
feet
of Me
that
I
am
He
Touch
Me
and
see
for
a spirit
flesh
and
bones
not
has
as
Me
you see
having
And
this
having said
He showed
to them
the
hands
and
the
feet
Still
now
while they were disbelieving
of them
for
the
joy
and
amazement
He said
to them
Have you
anything
to eat
here
-
And
they gave
to Him
of a fish
broiled
part
And
having taken [it]
before
them
He ate [it]
He said
now
unto
to them
These [are]
the
words
of me
which
I spoke
to
you
still
being
with
you
that
it behooves
to be fulfilled
all things
-
having been written
in
the
law
of Moses
and
the
Prophets
and
[the] Psalms
concerning
Me
Then
He opened
their
-
mind
-
to understand
the
Scriptures
And
He said
to them
-
Thus
it has been written
Was to suffer
the
Christ
and
to rise
out from
[the] dead
the
third
day
and
to be proclaimed
in
the
name
of Him
repentance
and
forgiveness
of sins
to
all
-
nations
having begun
from
Jerusalem
You
witnesses
of these things
And
behold
I
am sending
the
promise
of the
Father
of Me
upon
you
you
however
remain
in
the
city
until
that
you should be clothed with
from
on high
power
He led
now
them
as far as
to
Bethany
and
having lifted up
the
hands
of Him
He blessed
them
And
it came to pass
in
the
blessing
of Him
them
He was separated
from
them
and
was carried up
into
-
heaven
And
they
having worshiped
Him
returned
to
Jerusalem
with
joy
great
and
were
continually
all
in
the
temple
blessing
-
God
In [the]
beginning
was
the
Word
and
the
Word
was
with
-
God
and
God
was
the
Word
He
was
in [the]
beginning
with
-
God
All things
through
Him
came into being
and
without
Him
came into being
not even
one [thing]
that
has come into being
In
Him
life
was
and
the
life
was
the
light
-
of men
And
the
Light
in
the
darkness
shines
and
the
darkness
it
not
overcame
There came
a man
having been sent
from
God
[the] name
to Him
[was] John
He
came
as
a witness
that
he might testify
concerning
the
Light
that
all
might believe
through
him
Not
was
He
the
Light
but
that
he might witness
concerning
the
Light
Was
the
Light
-
true
who
enlightens
every
man
coming
into
the
world
In
the
world
He was
and
the
world
through
Him
came into being
and
the
world
Him
not
knew
To
the
own
He came
and
the
own
Him
not
received
As many as
however
received
Him
He gave
to them
authority
children
of God
to be
to those
believing
in
the
name
of Him
who
not
of
blood
nor
of
will
of flesh
nor
of
will
of man
but
of
God
were born
And
the
Word
flesh
became
and
dwelt
among
us
and
we beheld
the
glory
of Him
a glory
as
of an only begotten
from
[the] Father
full
of grace
and
truth
John
witnesses
concerning
Him
and
he cried out
saying
This
was He
of whom
I was saying
The [One]
after
me
coming
precedence
over me
has
because
before
me
He was
For
from
the
fullness
of Him
we
all
have received
then
grace
for
grace
For
the
law
through
Moses
was given
-
grace
and
-
truth
through
Jesus
Christ
came
God
no one
has seen
ever yet
[the] only begotten
God
the [One]
being
in
the
bosom
of the
Father
He
has made [Him] known
And
this
is
the
testimony
-
of John
when
sent
to
him
the
Jews
from
Jerusalem
priests
and
Levites
that
they might ask
him
You
who
are
And
he confessed
and
not
denied
but
confessed
-
I
not
am
the
Christ
And
they asked
him
What
then
You
Elijah
are
And
he says
Not
I am
The
prophet
are
you
And
he answered
No
They said
therefore
to him
Who
are you
That
an answer
we might give
to those
having sent
us
what
say you
about
yourself
He was saying
I [am]
a voice
crying
in
the
wilderness
Make straight
the
way
of [the] Lord
as
said
Isaiah
the
prophet
And
[those] having been sent
were
out from
the
Pharisees
And
they asked
him
and
said
to him
Why
then
baptize you
if
you
not
are
the
Christ
nor
Elijah
nor
the

them

John
saying
I
baptize
with
water
but in [the] midst
of you
stands [One]
whom
you
not
know
the [One]
after
me
coming
of whom
not
am
I
worthy
that
I should untie
of Him
the
strap
of the
sandal
These things
in
Bethany
took place
across
the
Jordan
where
was

baptizing
On the
next day
he sees

Jesus
coming
to
him
and
says
Behold
the
Lamb
-
of God
-
taking away
the
sin
of the
world
He
it is
concerning
whom
I
said
After
me
comes
a man
who
precedence
over me
has
because
before
me
He was
And I
not
knew
Him
but
that
He might be revealed
-
to Israel
because of
this
came
I
with
water
baptizing
And
bore witness
John
saying
-
I have beheld
the
Spirit
descending
as
a dove
out of
heaven
and
it remained
upon
Him
And I
not
knew
Him
but
the [One]
having sent
me
to baptize
with
water
He
to me
said
Upon
whom
-
you shall see
the
Spirit
descending
and
abiding
on
Him
He
is
the [One]
baptizing
with
[the] Spirit
Holy
And I
have seen
and
have borne witness
that
this
is
the
Son
-
of God
On the
next day
again
was standing
-
John
and
of
the
disciples
of him
two
And
having looked at
-
Jesus
walking
he says
Behold
the
Lamb

of God
And
heard
the
two
disciples
him
speaking
and
followed

Jesus
Having turned
then

Jesus
and
having beheld
them
following
He says
to them

they said
to Him
Rabbi

He says
to them
Come

therefore
and
saw
where
He abides
and
with
Him
they stayed
the
day
that
[The] hour
was
about

Was
Andrew

And
on the
day
-
third
a wedding
took place
in
Cana
-
of Galilee
and
was
the
mother
-
of Jesus
there
Was invited
then
also
-
Jesus
and
the
disciples
of Him
to
the
wedding
And
having been deficient
of wine
says
the
mother
-
of Jesus
to
Him
Wine
not
they have
And
says
to her
-
Jesus
What
to Me
and
to you
woman
Not yet
is come
the
hour
of Me
Says
the
mother
of Him
to the
servants
Whatever
anyhow
-
He may say
to you
do
There were
now
there
of stone
water jars
six
according to
the
purification
of the
Jews
standing
having space
for
metretae
two
or
three
Says
to them
-
Jesus
Fill
the
jars
with water
And
they filled
them
up to
[the] brim
And
He says
to them
Draw out
now
and
carry
to the
master of the feast
-
And
they carried [it]
When
then
had tasted
the
master of the feast
the
water
wine
having become
and
not
he knew
from where
it is
the
however
servants
knew
-
having drawn
the
water
calls
the
bridegroom
the
master of the feast
and
says
to him
Every
man
first
the
good
wine
sets out
and
when
they might have drunk freely
the
inferior
you
have kept
the
good
wine
until
now
This
did
[the] beginning
of the
signs
-
Jesus
in
Cana
-
of Galilee
and
He revealed
the
glory
of Him
and
believed
in
Him
the
disciples
of Him
After
this
He went down
to
Capernaum
He
and
the
mother
of Him
and
the
brothers
and
the
disciples
of Him
and
there
they stayed
not
many
days
And
near
was
the
Passover
of the
Jews
and
went up
to
Jerusalem
-
Jesus
And
He found
in
the
temple
those
selling
oxen
and
sheep
and
doves
and
the
money changers
sitting
And
having made
a whip
of
cords
all
He drove out
from
the
temple
-
both
sheep
and
-
oxen
and
of the
money changers
He poured out
the
coins
and
the
tables
He overthrew
And
to those
-
doves
selling
He said
Take
these things
from here
not
make
the
house
of the
Father
of Me
a house
of trade
Remembered
the
disciples
of Him
that
written
it is
The
zeal
of the
house
of You
will consume
Me
Answered
therefore
the
Jews
and
said
to Him
What
sign
show You
to us
that
these things
You do
Answered
Jesus
and
said
to them
Destroy
the
temple
this
and
in
three
days
I will raise up
it
Said
therefore
the
Jews
Forty
and
six
years
was built
the
temple
this
and
You
in
three
days
will raise up
it
He
however
was speaking
concerning
the
temple
of the
body
of Him
When
therefore
He was raised up
out from
[the] dead
remembered
the
disciples
of Him
that
this
He had said
and
they believed
the
Scripture
and
the
word
that
had spoken
-
Jesus
When
then
He was
in
-
Jerusalem
in
the
Passover
in
the
Feast
many
believed
in
the
name
of Him
beholding
of Him
the
signs
that
He was doing
On His part
however
Jesus
not
did entrust
Himself
to them
because of
-
His
knowing
all [men]
and
because
no
need
He had
that
anyone
should testify
concerning
the
man
He Himself
for
knew
what
was
in
the
man
There was
now
a man
of
the
Pharisees
Nicodemus
name
to him
a ruler
of the
Jews
He
came
to
Him
by night
and
said
to Him
Rabbi
we know
that
from
God
You have come
a teacher
no one
for
is able
these
-
signs
to do
that
You
do
if
not
should be
-
God
with
him
Answered
Jesus
and
said
to him
Truly
truly
I say
to you
if
not
anyone
be born
from above
not
he is able
to see
the
kingdom
-
of God
Says
to
Him
-
Nicodemus
How
is able
a man
to be born
old
being
Not
is he able
into
the
womb
of the
mother
of him
a second time
to enter
and
to be born
Answered
Jesus
Truly
truly
I say
to you
if
not
anyone
be born
of
water
and
of [the] Spirit
not
he is able
to enter
into
the
kingdom
-
of God
That
having been born
of
the
flesh
flesh
is
and
that
having been born
of
the
Spirit
spirit
is
Not
do wonder
that
I said
to you
It is necessary for
you [all]
to be born
from above
The
wind
where
it wishes
blows
and
the
sound
of it
You hear
but
not
you know
from where
it comes
and
where
it goes
thus
is
everyone
-
having been born
of
the
Spirit
Answered
Nicodemus
and
said
to Him
How
are able
these things
to be
Answered
Jesus
and
said
to him
You
are
the
teacher
-
of Israel
and
these things
not
know
Truly
truly
I say
to you
that
what
we know
we speak
and
what
we have seen
we bear witness to
and
the
witness
of us
not
you people receive
If
things
earthly
I have told
you
and
not
you believe
how
if
I tell
to you
the things
heavenly
will you believe
And
no one
has gone up
into
-
heaven
if
not
the [One]
out of
-
heaven
having come down
the
Son
-
of Man
And
as
Moses
lifted up
the
serpent
in
the
wilderness
thus
to be lifted up
it behooves
the
Son
-
of Man
so that
everyone
-
believing
in
Him
may have
life
eternal
Thus
for
loved
-
God
the
world
that
the
Son
the
only begotten
He gave
so that
everyone
-
believing
in
Him
not
should perish
but
should have
life
eternal
Not
for
sent
-
God
-
His Son
into
the
world
that
He might judge
the
world
but
that
might be saved
the
world
through
Him
The [one]
believing
on
Him
not
is judged
the [one]
not
believing
already
has been judged
because
not
he has believed
in
the
name
of the
only begotten
Son
-
of God
This
now
is
the
judgement
that
the
Light
has come
into
the
world
and
loved
-
men
rather
the
darkness
than
the
Light
were
for
of them
evil
the
deeds
Everyone
for
-
evil
practicing
hates
the
Light
and
not
comes
to
the
Light
so that
not
may be exposed
the
works
of him
the [one]
however
practicing
the
truth
comes
to
the
Light
that
may be manifest
his
-
works
that
in
God
have been
done
After
these things
came
-
Jesus
and
the
disciples
of Him
into
the
Judean
land
and
there
He was staying
with
them
and
was baptizing
Was
now
also
John
baptizing
in
Aenon
near
-
Salim
because
waters
many
were
there
and
they were coming
and
being baptized
Not yet
for
had been
cast
into
the
prison
John
Arose
then
a debate
among
the
disciples
of John
with
[a certain] Jew
about
purification
And
they came
to
-
John
and
said
to him
Rabbi
He who
was
with
you
beyond
the
Jordan
to whom
you
have borne witness
behold
He
baptizes
and
all
are coming
to
Him
Answered
John
and
said
Nothing
is able
a man
to receive
nothing
if
not
it is
given
to him
from
-
heaven
Yourselves
you
to me
bear witness
that
I said
Not
am
I
the
Christ
but
-
sent
I am
before
Him
The [one]
having
the
bride
[the] bridegroom
is
the
now
friend
of the
bridegroom
the [one]
standing
and
listening for
him
with joy
rejoices
because of
the
voice
of the
bridegroom
This
therefore
the
joy
-
of mine
is fulfilled
Him
it behooves
to increase
me
however
to decrease
The [One]
from above
coming
above
all
is
The [one]
being
from
the
earth
from
the
earth
is
and
from
the
earth
speaks
The [One]
from
-
heaven
coming
above
all
is
What
He has seen
and
heard
this
He testifies
and
the
testimony
of Him
no one
receives
The [one]
having received
His
-
testimony
has set his seal
that
-
God
true
is
He whom
for
sent
-
God
the
words
-
of God
speaks
not
for
by
measure
He gives
the
Spirit
The
Father
loves
the
Son
and
all things
has given
into
the
hand
of Him
The [one]
believing
in
the
Son
has
life
eternal
the [one]
however
not obeying
the
Son
not
will see
life
but
the
wrath
-
of God
abides
on
him
When
therefore
knew
-
Jesus
that
heard
the
Pharisees
that
Jesus
more
disciples
makes
and
baptizes
than
John
although indeed
Jesus
Himself
not
was baptizing
but
the
disciples
of Him
He left
-
Judea
and
went away
again
into
-
Galilee
It was necessary for
now
Him
to pass
through
-
Samaria
He comes
therefore
to
a city
-
of Samaria
called
Sychar
near
the
plot of ground
that
had given
Jacob
Joseph
the
son
of him
Was
now
there
[the] well
-
of Jacob
-
Therefore
Jesus
being wearied
from
the
journey
was sitting
thus
at
the
well
[The] hour
was
about
[the] sixth
Comes
a woman
out of
-
Samaria
to draw
water
Says
to her
-
Jesus
Give
Me
to drink
-
For
the disciples
of Him
had gone away
into
the
city
that
food
they might buy
Says
therefore
to Him
the
woman
-
Samaritan
How
You
a Jew
being
from
me
to drink
do ask
a woman
Samaritan
being
Not
for
have association
Jews
with Samaritans
Answered
Jesus
and
said
to her
If
you had known
the
gift
-
of God
and
who
it is
-
saying
to you
Give
Me
to drink
you
-
would have asked
Him
and
He would have given
-
to you
water
living
Says
to Him
Sir
nothing
to draw with
You have
and
the
well
is
deep
from where
then
have You
the
water
-
living
Not
You
greater than
are
the
father
of us
Jacob
who
gave
us
the
well
and
himself
of
it
drank
and
the
sons
of him
and
the
livestock
of him
Answered
Jesus
and
said
to her
Everyone
-
drinking
of
the
water
this
will thirst
again
whoever
however
-
may drink
of
the
water
that
I
will give
him
never
not
will thirst
to
the
age
Instead
the
water
that
I will give
to him
will become
in
him
a spring
of water
welling up
into
life
eternal
Says
to
Him
the
woman
Sir
give
me
this
-
water
that
not
I might thirst
nor
come
here
to draw
He says
to her
Go
call
the
husband
of you
and
come
here
Answered
the
woman
and
said
Not
I have
a husband
Says
to her
-
Jesus
Correctly
you have spoken
-
A husband
not
I have
Five
for
husbands
you have had
and
now
he whom
you have
not
is
your
husband
this
truly
you have spoken
Says
to Him
the
woman
Sir
I understand
that
a prophet
are
You
The
fathers
of us
on
the
mountain
this
worshiped
and
you
say
that
in
Jerusalem
is
the
place
where
to worship
it is necessary
Says
to her
-
Jesus
Believe
Me
woman
that
is coming
an hour
when
neither
on
the
mountain
this
nor
in
Jerusalem
will you worship
the
Father
You
worship
what
not
you know
we
worship
what
we know
for
-
salvation
of
the
Jews
is
But
is coming
an hour
and
now
is
when
the
true
worshipers
will worship
the
Father
in
spirit
and
truth
also
for
the
Father
such
seeks
who
worship
Him
Spirit
-
God [is]
and
those
worshiping
in
spirit
and
truth
it behooves
to worship
Says
to Him
the
woman
I know
that
Messiah
is coming
who
is called
Christ
when
comes
He
He will tell
us
all things
Says
to her
-
Jesus
I
am [He]
the [One]
speaking
to you
And
upon
this
came
the
disciples
of Him
and
were amazed
that
with
a woman
He was speaking
no one
however
said
What
seek You
Or
Why
speak You
with
her
Left
then
the
water pot
of her
the
woman
and
went away
into
the
city
and
says
to the
men
Come
see
a man
who
told
me
all things
whatever
I did
Can it be [that]
this
is
the
Christ
They went forth
out of
the
city
and
were coming
unto
Him
But in
the
meantime
were asking
Him
the
disciples
saying
Rabbi
eat
-
But
He said
to them
I
food
have
to eat
that
you
not
know
Were saying
therefore
the
disciples
to
one another
No
one
did bring
Him
[anything] to eat
Says
to them
-
Jesus
My
food
is
that
I should do
the
will
of the [One]
having sent
Me
and
should finish
of Him
the
work
Not
you
say
that
yet
four months
it is
and
the
harvest
comes
Behold
I say
to you
lift up
the
eyes
of you
and
see
the
fields
because
white
they are
toward
harvest
already
The [one]
reaping
a reward
receives
and
gathers
fruit
unto
life
eternal
so that
the [one]
sowing
together
may rejoice
and
the [one]
reaping
In
for
this
the
saying
is
true
-
One
is
-
sowing
and
another
-
reaping
I
sent
you
to reap
what
not
you
have toiled for
others
have toiled
and
you
into
the
labor
of them
have entered
Out of
now
the
city
that
many
believed
in
Him
of the
Samaritans
because of
the
word
of the
woman
testifying
-
He told
me
all things
whatever
I did
When
therefore
came
to
Him
the
Samaritans
they were asking
Him
to abide
with
them
and
He stayed
there
two
days
And
many
more
believed
because of
the
word
of Him
-
and
to the woman
they were saying
-
No longer
because of
-
your
speech
we believe
we ourselves
for
have heard
and
we know
that
this
is
truly
the
Savior
of the
world
After
then
the
two
days
He went forth
from there
into
-
Galilee
Himself
for
Jesus
testified
that
a prophet
in
the
own
hometown
honor
not
has
When
therefore
He came
into
-
Galilee
received
Him
the
Galileans
all things
having seen
how great
He had done
in
Jerusalem
during
the
feast
also
themselves
for
they had gone
to
the
feast
He came
therefore
again
to
-
Cana
-
of Galilee
where
He had made
the
water
wine
And
there was
a certain
royal official
whose
-
son
was sick
in
Capernaum
He
having heard
that
Jesus
had come
out of
-
Judea
into
-
Galilee
went
to
Him
and
was asking
that
He would come down
and
heal
his
-
son
he was about
for
to die
Said
therefore
-
Jesus
to
him
If
not
signs
and
wonders
you people see
no
not
will you believe
Says
to
Him
the
royal official
Sir
come down
before
dies
the
child
of me
Says
to him
-
Jesus
Go
the
son
of you
lives
Believed
the
man
the
word
that
said
to him
-
Jesus
and
he went on his way
Already
then
[as] he
is going down
the
servants
met
him
saying
that
the
boy
of him
lives
He inquired
therefore
the
hour
from
them
in
which
better
he got
They said
therefore
to him
-
Yesterday
[at the] hour
seventh
left
him
the
fever
Knew
therefore
the
father
that [it was]
that
the
hour
at
which
said
to him
-
Jesus
The
son
of You
lives
And
he believed
himself
and
the
household
of him
all
This [is]
now
again
[the] second
sign
did
-
Jesus
having come
out of
-
Judea
into
-
Galilee
After
these things
there was
a feast
of the
Jews
and
went up
Jesus
to
Jerusalem
There is
now
in
-
Jerusalem
by
the
Sheep Gate
a pool
-
called
in Hebrew
Bethesda
five
porches
having
In
these
were lying
a multitude
of those
ailing
blind
lame
paralyzed
awaiting
the
of the
water
moving
An angel
for
during
[a certain] season
descended
into
the
pool
and
stirred
the
water
He who
therefore
first
entered
after
the
stirring
of the
water
well
was made
from whatever
at the time
he was held by
disease
Was
now
a certain
man
there
thirty
and
eight
years
being
in
-
infirmity
himself
Him
having seen
-
Jesus
lying
and
having known
that
a long
already
time
he has been
He says
to him
Desire you
well
to become
Answered
Him
the [one]
ailing
Sir
a man
not
I have
that
when
has been stirred
the
water
he might put
me
into
the
pool
in
which
now
am going
I
another
before
me
descends
Says
to him
-
Jesus
Arise
take up
the
mat
of you
and
walk
And
immediately
became
well
the
man
and
he took up
the
mat
of him
and
began to walk
It was
now
Sabbath
on
that
-
day
Were saying
therefore
the
Jews
to the [one]
having been healed
Sabbath
it is
and
not
it is lawful
for you
to take up
the
mat
who
however
answered
them
The [One]
having made
me
well
that One
to me
said
Take up
the
mat
of you
and
walk
They asked
him
Who
is
the
man
-
having said
to you
Take up
and
walk
The [one]
now
having been healed
not
knew
who
it is
-
for
Jesus
had moved away
a crowd
being
in
the
place
After
these things
finds
him
-
Jesus
in
the
temple
and
said
to him
Behold
well
you have become
no more
sin
that
not
worse
to you
something
happens
Went away
the
man
and
told
the
Jews
that
Jesus
it is
the [One]
having made
him
well
And
because of
this
were persecuting
the
Jews
-
Jesus
because
these things
He was doing
on
[the] Sabbath
-
But
answered
them
The
Father
of Me
until
now
is working
and I
am working
Because of
this
therefore
the more
were seeking
Him
the
Jews
to kill
because
not
only
was He breaking
the
Sabbath
but
also
Father
His own
He was calling
-
God
equal
Himself
making
to
God
Answered
therefore
-
Jesus
and
was saying
to them
Truly
truly
I say
to you
not
is able
the
Son
to do
of
Himself
nothing
if
not
anything
He might see
the
Father
doing
whatever
for
-
He
does
these things
also
the
Son
likewise
does
-
For
the Father
loves
the
Son
and
all things
shows
to Him
that
He
does
and
greater
than these
He will show
Him
works
so that
you
may marvel
Even as
for
the
Father
raises up
the
dead
and
gives life
thus
also
the
Son
to whom
He will
gives life
Not even
for
the
Father
judges
no one
but
-
judgment
all
has given
to the
Son
so that
all
may honor
the
Son
even as
they honor
the
Father
He who
not
is honoring
the
Son
not
is honoring
the
Father
the [One]
having sent
Him
Truly
truly
I say
to you
that
the [one]
the
word
of Me
hearing
and
believing
the [One]
having sent
Me
he has
life
eternal
and
into
judgment
not
comes
but
has passed
out of
-
death
into
-
life
Truly
truly
I say
to you
that
is coming
an hour
and
now
is
when
the
dead
will hear
the
voice
of the
Son
-
of God
and
those
having heard
will live
As
for
the
Father
has
life
in
Himself
so
also
to the
Son
He gave
life
to have
in
Himself
And
authority
He gave
Him
judgment
to execute
because
Son
of Man
He is
Not
marvel at
this
for
is coming
an hour
in
which
all
those
in
the
tombs
will hear
the
voice
of Him
and
will come forth
those
-
good
having done
to
[the] resurrection
of life
-
those
evil
having done
to
[the] resurrection
of judgment
Not
am able
I
to do
of
Myself
nothing
as
I hear
I judge
and
the
judgment
-
of Me
just
is
because
not
I seek
the
will
-
of Me
but
the
will
of the [One]
having sent
Me
If
I
bear witness
concerning
Myself
the
testimony
of Me
not
is
true
Another
it is
-
bearing witness
concerning
Me
and
I know
that
true
is
the
testimony
which
he bears witness
concerning
Me
You
have sent
unto
John
and
he has borne witness
to the
truth
I
now
not
from
man
the
testimony
receive
but
these things
I say
that
you
may be saved
He
was
the
lamp
-
burning
and
shining
you
now
were willing
to rejoice
for
a season
in
the
light
of him
I
however
have
the
testimony
greater than
that
of John
-
For
the works
that
has given
Me
the
Father
that
I should complete
them
same
the
works
which
I do
bear witness
concerning
Me
that
the
Father
Me
has sent
And
the [One]
having sent
Me
[the] Father
Himself
has borne witness
concerning
Me
Neither
voice
of Him
at any time
have You heard
nor
form
of Him
have you seen
And
the
word
of Him
not
you have
in
you
abiding
for
whom
sent
He
Him
you
not
believe
You diligently search
the
Scriptures
for
you
think
in
them
life
eternal
to have
and
these
are they
-
bearing witness
concerning
Me
and
not
you are willing
to come
to
Me
that
life
you may have
Glory
from
men
not
I take
but
I have known
you
that
the
love
-
of God
not
you have
in
yourselves
I
have come
in
the
name
of the
Father
of Me
and
not
you receive
Me
if
another
should come
in
the
name
the
own
him
you will receive
How
are able
you
to believe
glory
from
one another
receiving
and
the
glory
that [is]
from
the
only
God
not
you seek
Not
think
that
I
will accuse
you
to
the
Father
There is
[one]
accusing
you
Moses
in
whom
you
have hoped
If
for
you were believing
Moses
you would have believed
-
Me
concerning
for
Me
he
wrote
If
now
-
his
writings
not
you believe
how
-
My
words
will you believe
After
these things
went away
-
Jesus
over
the
Sea
-
of Galilee
-
of Tiberias
Was following
now
Him
a crowd
great
because
they were seeing
the
signs
which
He was doing
upon
those
being sick
Went up
now
on
the
mountain
Jesus
and
there
He was sitting
with
the
disciples
of Him
Was
now
near
the
Passover
the
feast
of the
Jews
Having lifted up
then
the
eyes
-
Jesus
and
having seen
that
a great
crowd
is coming
to
Him
He says
to
Philip
From where
shall we buy
bread
that
might eat
these
This
now
He was saying
testing
him
He
for
knew
what
He was about
to do
Answered
Him
-
Philip
Two hundred
denarii worth
of loaves
not
are sufficient
for them
that
each
little [piece]
one
might receive
Says
to Him
one
of
the
disciples
of Him
Andrew
the
brother
of Simon
Peter
Is
a little boy
here
who
has
five
loaves
barley
and
two
small fish
but
these
what
are
for
so many
Said
-
Jesus
Make
the
men
to recline
There was
now
grass
much
in
the
place
Reclined
therefore
the
men
the
number
about
five thousand
Took
then
the
loaves
-
Jesus
and
having given thanks
He distributed
to those
reclining
likewise
also
of
the
fish
as much as
they wished
When
now
they were filled
He says
to the
disciples
of Him
Gather together
the
having been over and above
fragments
so that
nothing
anything
may be lost
They gathered together
therefore
and
filled
twelve
hand-baskets
of fragments
from
the
five
loaves
-
barley
which
were over and above
to those
having eaten
The
therefore
people
having seen
what
He had done
[the] sign
were saying
-
This
is
truly
the
prophet
who
is coming
into
the
world
Jesus
therefore
having known
that
they are about
to come
and
to seize
Him
that
they might make [Him]
king
withdrew
again
to
the
mountain
Himself
alone
When
now
evening
it became
went down
the
disciples
of Him
to
the
sea
and
having entered
into
a boat
they were going
over
the
sea
to
Capernaum
And
dark
already
it had become
and
not
had come
to
them
-
Jesus
-
And
the sea
by a wind
strong
blowing
was agitated
Having rowed
therefore
about
stadia
twenty
five
or
thirty
they see
-
Jesus
walking
on
the
sea
and
near
the
boat
coming
and
they were frightened
-
And
He says
to them
I
am [He]
not
fear
They were willing
then
to receive
Him
into
the
boat
and
immediately
was
the
boat
at
the
land
to
which
they were going
On the
next day
the
crowd
-
standing
on the other side
of the
sea
having seen
that
boat
other
no
was
there
if
not
one
and
that
not
went with
the
disciples
of Him
-
Jesus
into
the
boat
but
alone
the
disciples
of Him
went away
but other
came
boats
from
Tiberias
near
the
place
where
they ate
the
bread
having given thanks
the
Lord
When
therefore
saw
the
crowd
that
Jesus
not
is
there
nor
the
disciples
of Him
they entered
themselves
into
the
boats
and
came
to
Capernaum
seeking
-
Jesus
And
having found
Him
on the other side
of the
sea
they said
to Him
Rabbi
when
here
have You come
Answered
them
-
Jesus
and
said
Truly
truly
I say
to you
you seek
Me
not
because
you saw
signs
but
because
you ate
of
the
loaves
and
were satisfied
Work
not [for]
the
food
that
is perishing
but [for]
the
food
-
enduring
unto
life
eternal
which
the
Son
-
of Man
to you
will give
Him
for
the
Father
has sealed
-
God
They said
therefore
to
Him
What
must we do
that
we may be doing
the
works
-
of God
Answered
Jesus
and
said
to them
This
is
the
work
-
of God
that
you should believe
in
Him whom
has sent
He
They said
therefore
to Him
What
then
do
You
[as a] sign
that
we may see
and
may believe
You
What
work do You perform
The
fathers
of us
the
manna
ate
in
the
wilderness
as
it is
written
Bread
from
-
heaven
He gave
them
to eat
Said
therefore
to them
-
Jesus
Truly
truly
I say
to you
not
Moses
has given
you
the
bread
from
-
heaven
but
the
Father
of Me
gives
you
the
bread
from
-
heaven
-
true
The
for
bread
-
of God
is
the [One]
coming down
out of
-
heaven
and
life
giving
to the
world
They said
therefore
to
Him
Sir
always
give
to us
the
bread
this
Said
to them
-
Jesus
I
am
the
bread
-
of life
the [one]
coming
to
Me
never
not
shall hunger
and
the [one]
believing
in
Me
no
not
shall thirst
at any time
But
I said
to you
that
also
you have seen
Me
and yet
not
believe
All
that
gives
Me
the
Father
to
Me
will come
and
the [one]
coming
to
Me
no
not
shall I cast
out
For
I have come down
from
-
heaven
not
that
I should do
the
will
-
of Me
but
the
will
of the [One]
having sent
Me
This
now
is
the
will
of the [One]
having sent
Me
that
all
that
He has given
Me
none
I should lose
of
it
but
will raise up
it
in
the
last
day
This
for
is
the
will
of the
Father
of Me
that
everyone
-
beholding
the
Son
and
believing
in
Him
should have
life
eternal
and
will raise up
him
I
in
the
last
day
Were grumbling
therefore
the
Jews
about
Him
because
He said
I
am
the
bread
-
having come down
from
-
heaven
And
they were saying
Not
this
is
Jesus
the
son
of Joseph
of whom
we
know
the
father
and
the
mother
How
then
says He
-
From
-
heaven
I have come down
Answered
Jesus
and
said
to them
Not
grumble
with
one another
No one
is able
to come
to
Me
if
not
the
Father
the [one]
having sent
Me
draws
him
and I
will raise up
him
in
the
last
day
It is
written
in
the
prophets
And
they will be
all
taught
of God
Everyone
-
having heard
from
the
Father
and
having learned
comes
to
Me
Not
that
the
Father
has seen
anyone
if
not
the [One]
being
from
-
God
He
has seen
the
Father
Truly
truly
I say
to you
the [one]
believing
has
life
eternal
I
am
the
bread
-
of life
The
fathers
of You
ate
in
the
wilderness
the
manna
and
died
This
is
the
bread
-
from
-
heaven
coming down
that
anyone
of
it
may eat
and
not
die
I
am
the
bread
-
living
-
from
-
heaven
having come down
if
anyone
shall have eaten
of
this
-
bread
he will live
to
the
age
and
the
bread
also
that
I
will give
the
flesh
of Me
is
for
the
of the
world
life
Were arguing
therefore
with
one another
the
Jews
saying
How
is able
this [man]
us
to give
the
flesh
to eat
Said
therefore
to them
-
Jesus
Truly
truly
I say
to you
if
not
you shall have eaten
the
flesh
of the
Son
-
of Man
and
shall have drunk
of Him
the
blood
not
you have
life
in
yourselves
The [one]
eating
of Me
the
flesh
and
drinking
of Me
the
blood
has
life
eternal
and I
will raise up
him
in the
last
day
The
for
flesh
of Me
true
is
food
and
the
blood
of Me
true
is
drink
The [one]
eating
of Me
the
flesh
and
drinking
of Me
the
blood
in
Me
abides
and I
in
him
As
sent
Me
the
living
Father
and I
live
because of
the
Father
also
the [one]
feeding on
Me
he also
will live
because of
Me
This
is
the
bread
-
from
heaven
having come down
not
as
ate
the
fathers
and
died
The [one]
eating
this
-
bread
will live
to
the
age
These things
He said
in
[the] synagogue
teaching
in
Capernaum
Many
therefore
having heard
of
the
disciples
of Him
said
Difficult
is
the
word
this
who
is able
it
to hear
Knowing
however
-
Jesus
in
Himself
that
are grumbling
about
this
the
disciples
of Him
He said
to them
This
you
does offend
What if
then
you should see
the
Son
-
of Man
ascending
where
He was
-
before
The
Spirit
it is
-
giving life
the
flesh
not
profits
nothing
The
words
that
I
speak
to you
spirit
are
and
life
they are
But
they are
of
you
some
who
not
believe
Knew
for
from
[the] beginning
-
Jesus
who
are
those
not
believing
and
who
it is
who
will betray
Him
And
He was saying
Because of
this
have I said
to you
that
no one
is able
to come
to
Me
if
not
it shall
have been granted
to him
from
the
Father
From
that [time]
many
the
disciples
of Him
departed
to
the
back
and
no longer
with
Him
walked
Said
therefore
-
Jesus
to the
Twelve
Not
also
you
are wishing
to go away
Answered
Him
Simon
Peter
Lord
to
whom
will we go
[The] words
of life
eternal
You have
and
we
have believed
and
have known
that
You
are
the
Holy One
-
of God
Answered
them
-
Jesus
Not
I
you
the
Twelve
did choose
and
of
you
one
a devil
is
He was speaking
now
-
of Judas
[son] of Simon
Iscariot
he
for
was about
to betray
Him
one
of
the
Twelve
And
after
these things
was walking
-
Jesus
in
-
Galilee
not
for
He did desire
in
-
Judea
to walk
because
were seeking
Him
the
Jews
to kill
Was
now
near
the
feast
of the
Jews
of
Booths
Said
therefore
to
Him
the
brothers
of Him
Depart
from here
and
go
into
-
Judea
so that
also
the
disciples
of You
will see
the
works
of You
that
You are doing
No one
for
anything
in
secret
does
and
seeks
himself
in
public
to be
If
these things
You do
show
Yourself
to the
world
Not even
for
the
brothers
of Him
were believing
in
Him
Says
therefore
to them
-
Jesus
The
time
-
of Me
not yet
is come
-
but
the time
-
of you
always
is
ready
Not
is able
the
world
to hate
you
Me
however
it hates
because
I
bear witness
concerning
it
that
the
works
of it
evil
are
You
go up
to
the
feast
I
not
am going up
to
the
feast
this
for
-
My
time
not yet
has been fulfilled
These things
now
having said
to them
He remained
in
-
Galilee
When
however
had gone up
the
brothers
of Him
to
the
feast
then
also
He
went up
not
openly
but
as
in
secret
The
therefore
Jews
were seeking
Him
at
the
feast
and
were saying
Where
is
He
And
murmuring
about
Him
there was
much
among
the
crowds
Some
indeed
were saying
-
Good
He is
Others
however
were saying
No
but
He deceives
the
people
No one
however
publicly
was speaking
about
Him
because of
the
fear
of the
Jews
Now
also
of the
feast
being in the middle
went up
Jesus
into
the
temple
and
was teaching
Were marveling
then
the
Jews
saying
How
this one
writings
knows
not
having studied
Answered
therefore
them
Jesus
and
said
-
My
teaching
not
is
of Myself
but
of the [One]
having sent
Me
If
anyone
desires
the
will
of Him
to do
he will know
concerning
the
teaching
whether
from
-
God
it is
or
I
from
Myself
speak
The [one]
from
himself
speaking
the
glory
the
own
seeks
the [One]
however
seeking
the
glory
of the [One]
having sent
Him
He
true
is
and
unrighteousness
in
Him
not
is
Not
Moses
has given
to you
the
law
and
no one
of
you
keeps
the
law
Why
Me
do you seek
to kill
Answered
the
crowd
A demon
You have
who
You
seeks
to kill
Answered
Jesus
and
said
to them
One
work
I did
and
all
you marvel
Because of
the fact that
Moses
has given
you
-
circumcision
not
that
of
-
Moses
it is
but
of
the
fathers
also
on
Sabbath
you circumcise
a man
If
circumcision
receives
a man
on
Sabbath
so that
not
might be broken
the
law
of Moses
with Me
are you angry
because
entirely
a man
sound
I made
on
the Sabbath
Not
judge
according to
appearance
but
the
righteous
judgment
judge
Were saying
therefore
some
of
those
of Jerusalem
Not
this
is he
whom
they seek
to kill
And
behold
publicly
He speaks
and
nothing
to Him
they say
not
ever
Truly
have recognized
the
rulers
that
this
is
the
Christ
But
this [man]
we know
from where
He is
The
however
Christ
whenever
He may come
no one
knows
from where
He is
Cried out
therefore
in
the
temple
teaching
-
Jesus
and
saying
Me
you know
and
you know
from where
I am
and
of
Myself
not
I have come
but
is
true
the [One]
having sent
Me
whom
you
not
know
But I
know
Him
because
from
Him
I am
and He
Me
sent
They were seeking
therefore
Him
to take
but
no one
laid
upon
Him
the
hand
because
not yet
had come
the
hour
of Him
Out of
the
crowd
now
many
believed
in
Him
and
were saying
The
Christ
When
He comes
not
more
signs
will He do
than
this [man]
has done
Heard
the
Pharisees
the
crowd
murmuring
about
Him
these things
and
sent
the
chief priests
and
the
Pharisees
officers
that
they might seize
Him
Said
therefore
-
Jesus
Yet
time
a little
with
you
I am
and
I go
to
the [One]
having sent
Me
You will seek
Me
and
not
will find
and
where
am
I
you
not
are able
to come
Said
therefore
the
Jews
among
themselves
Where
He
is about
to go
that
we
not
will find
Him
Not
to
the
Dispersion
among the
Greeks
is He about
to go
and
to teach
the
Greeks
What
is
the
word
this
that
He said
You will seek
Me
and
not
will find
and
Where
am
I
you
not
are able
to come
In
now
the
last
day
the
great [day]
of the
feast
stood
-
Jesus
and
cried out
saying
If
anyone
thirsts
let him come
to
Me
and
drink
The [one]
believing
in
Me
as
has said
the
Scripture
Rivers
out of
the
belly
of him
will flow
of water
living
This
now
He said
concerning
the
Spirit
whom
were about
to receive
those
having believed
in
Him
not yet [given]
for
was
[the] Spirit
because
Jesus
not yet
was glorified
[Some] of
the
crowd
therefore
having heard
the
words
these
were saying
This
is
truly
the
Prophet
Others
were saying
This
is
the
Christ
Others
however
were saying
Not
indeed
out of
-
Galilee
the
Christ
comes
Not
the
Scripture
has said
that
out of
the
seed
of David
and
from
Bethlehem
the
village
where
was
David
comes
the
Christ
A division
therefore
occurred
in
the
crowd
because of
Him
Some
now
desired
of
them
to seize
Him
but
no one
laid
on
Him
the
hands
Came
therefore
the
officers
to
the
chief priests
and
Pharisees
and
said
to them
that
Because of
why
not
did you bring
Him
Answered
the
officers
Never
spoke
like this
a man
as
this
speaks
-
man
Answered
therefore
them
the
Pharisees
Not
also
you
have been deceived
Not
any
of
the
rulers
has believed
on
Him
or
of
the
Pharisees
But
the
crowd
this
-
not
knowing
the
law
accursed
are
Says
Nicodemus
to
them
the [one]
having come
to
Him
former
one
being
of
them
Not
the
law
of us
does judge
the
man
if
not
it has heard
first
from
him
and
known
what
he does
They answered
and
said
to him
Not
also
you
from
-
Galilee
are
Search
and
see
that
out of
-
Galilee
a prophet
not
is raised
And
went
each
to
the
home
of him
Jesus
however
went
to
the
Mount
-
of Olives
Early in the morning
then
again
He came
into
the
temple
and
all
the
people
were coming
to
Him
And
having sat down
He was teaching
them
Bring
now
the
scribes
and
the
Pharisees
to
Him
a woman
in
adultery
having been caught
and
having set
her
in
[the] midst
they say
to Him
Teacher
this
-
woman
was caught
in the very act
committing adultery
In
now
the
law
Moses
us
commanded
-
such
to be stoned
You
therefore
what
say You
This
now
they were saying
testing
Him
so that
they might have [grounds]
to accuse
Him
-
But
Jesus
down
having stooped
with
[His] finger
began writing
on
the
ground
As
however
they continued
asking
Him
having lifted Himself up
also
He said
to them
The [one]
sinless
among you
the first
-
stone
at
her
let him cast
And
again
down
having stooped
He continued to write
on
the
ground
-
And
having heard
and
by
[their]
conscience
being convicted
they began to go away
one
by
having begun
from
the
elder ones
until
the
last
and
He was left
alone
-
Jesus
and
the
woman
in
[the] midst
being
Having lifted up
then
-
Jesus
and
no one
saw
but
the
woman
said
to her
-
Woman
where
are
they
who
accuse
you
No one
you
has condemned
-
And
she said
No one
Sir
Said
then
to her
-
Jesus
Neither
I
you
do condemn
go
and
no more
sin
Again
therefore
to them
spoke
-
Jesus
saying
I
am
the
light
of the
world
the [one]
following
Me
no
not
shall walk
in
the
darkness
but
will have
the
light
-
of life
Said
therefore
to Him
the
Pharisees
You
concerning
Yourself
are bearing witness
the
testimony
of You
not
is
true
Answered
Jesus
and
said
to them
Even if
I
am bearing witness
concerning
Myself
true
is
the
testimony
of Me
because
I know
from where
I came
and
where
I am going
You
however
not
know
from where
I come
or
where
I am going
You
according to
the
flesh
judge
I
not
am judging
no one
And
if
judge
however
I
-
judgment
-
My
true
is
because
alone
not
I am
but
I
and
the
having sent
Me
And
in
the
law
also
-
of you
it has been written
that
of two
men
the
testimony
true
is
I
am
the [One]
bearing witness
concerning
Myself
and
bears witness
concerning
Me
the
having sent
Me
Father
They were saying
therefore
to Him
Where
is
the
Father
of You
Answered
Jesus
Neither
Me
you know
nor
the
Father
of Me
If
Me
you had known
also
the
Father
of Me
-
you would have known
These
-
words
He spoke
in
the
treasury
teaching
in
the
temple
and
no one
seized
Him
for
not yet
had come
the
hour
of Him
He said
then
again
to them
I
am going away
and
you will seek
Me
and
in
the
sin
of you
you will die
where
I
go
you
not
are able
to come
Were saying
therefore
the
Jews
Not
will He kill
Himself
that
He says
Where
I
go
you
not
are able
to come
And
He was saying
to them
You
from
-
below
are
I
from
-
above
am
You
of
this
the
world
are
I
not
am
of
the
world
this
I said
therefore
to you
that
you will die
in
the
sins
of you
if
for
not
you believe
that
I
am [He]
you will die
in
the
sins
of you
They were saying
therefore
to Him
You
who
are
Said
to them
-
Jesus
From the
beginning
-
what
also
I am saying
to you
Many things
I have
concerning
you
to say
and
to judge
but
the [One]
having sent
Me
true
is
and I
what
I have heard
from
Him
these things
I say
to
the
world
Not
they understood
that
[about] the
Father
to them
He was speaking
Said
therefore
-
Jesus
When
you shall have lifted up
the
Son
-
of Man
then
you will know
that
I
am [He]
and
from
Myself
I do
nothing
but
as
taught
Me
the
Father
these things
I speak
And
the [One]
having sent
Me
with
Me
is
not
He has left
Me
alone
because
I
the things
pleasing
to Him
do
always
These things
of His
speaking
many
believed
in
Him
Was saying
therefore
-
Jesus
to
the
having believed
in Him
Jews
If
you
abide
in
the
word
-
My
truly
disciples
of Me
you are
And
you will know
the
truth
and
the
truth
will set free
you
They answered
unto
Him
Seed
of Abraham
we are
and
to no one
have we been under bondage
ever
How
You
say
-
Free
you will become
Answered
them
-
Jesus
Truly
truly
I say
to you
that
everyone
-
practicing
the
sin
a slave
is
of the
sin
-
Now
the slave
not
abides
in
the
house
to
the
age
the
son
abides
to
the
age
If
therefore
the
Son
you
shall set free
indeed
free
you will be
I know
that
seed
of Abraham
you are
but
you seek
Me
to kill
because
the
word
-
of Me
not
receives a place
in
you
That which
I
have seen
with
the
Father
I speak
also
you
therefore
what
you have heard
from
the
father
you do
They answered
and
said
to Him
The
father
of us
Abraham
is
Says
to them
-
Jesus
If
children
-
of Abraham
you were
the
works
-
of Abraham
you would do
now
however
you seek
Me
to kill
a man
who
the
truth
to you
has spoken
that
I heard
from
-
God
This
Abraham
not
did
You
are doing
the
works
of the
father
of you
They said
to Him
We
of
sexual immorality
not
have been born
one
Father
we have
-
God
Said
to them
-
Jesus
If
-
God
Father
of you
were
you would have loved
-
Me
I
for
from
-
God
came forth
and
am here
not even
for
of
Myself
have I come
but
He
Me
sent
Because of
why
the
speech
-
My
not
do you understand
Because
not
you are able
to hear
the
word
-
My
You
of
the
father
the
devil
are
and
the
desires
of
father
of you
you desire
to do
He
a murderer
was
from
[the] beginning
and
in
the
truth
not
has stood
because
not
there is
truth
in
him
Whenever
he might speak
-
falsehood
from
the
own
he speaks
for
a liar
he is
and
the
father
of it
I
now
because
the
truth
speak
not
you do believe
Me
Which
of
you
convicts
me
concerning
sin
If
[the] truth
I speak
because of
why
you
not
do believe
Me
He who
is
of
-
God
the
words
-
of God
hears
because of
this
you
not
hear
because
of
-
God
not
you are
Answered
the
Jews
and
said
to Him
Not
rightly
say
we
that
a Samaritan
are
You
and
a demon
have
Answered
Jesus
I
a demon
not
have
but
I honor
the
Father
of Me
and
you
dishonor
Me
I
now
not
seek
the
glory
of Me
there is
One
seeking [it]
and
judging
Truly
truly
I say
to you
if
anyone
-
My
word
keeps
death
never
not
shall he see
to
the
age
Said
to Him
the
Jews
Now
we know
that
a demon
You have
Abraham
died
and
the
prophets
and
You
say
If
anyone
the
word
of Me
keeps
never
not
shall he taste
of death
to
the
age
Not
You
greater than
are
the
father
of us
Abraham
who
died
And
the
prophets
died
Whom
yourself
make You
Answered
Jesus
If
I
glorify
Myself
the
glory
of Me
nothing
is
it is
the
Father
of Me
-
glorifying
Me
[of] whom
you
say
-
God
of us
He is
And
not
you have known
Him
I
however
know
Him
And if
I say
that
not
I know
Him
I will be
like
you
a liar
But
I know
Him
and
the
word
of Him
I keep
Abraham
the
father
of you
rejoiced
in that
he should see
-
day
-
My
and
he saw
and
rejoiced
Said
therefore
the
Jews
to
Him
Fifty
years [old]
not yet
are You
and
Abraham
You have seen
Said
to them
Jesus
Truly
truly
I say
to you
before
Abraham
was
I
am
They took up
therefore
stones
that
they might cast
at
Him
Jesus
however
hid Himself
and
went forth
out of
the
temple
And
passing by
He saw
a man
blind
from
birth
And
asked
Him
the
disciples
of Him
saying
Rabbi
who
sinned
this [man]
or
the
parents
of him
that
blind
he should be born
Answered
Jesus
Neither
this [man]
sinned
nor
the
parents
of him
but
[it was] that
should be displayed
the
works
-
of God
in
him
Us
it behooves
to work
the
works
of the [One]
having sent
Me
while
day
it is
is coming
night
when
no one
is able
to work
While
in
the
world
I shall be
[the] light
I am
of the
world
These things
having said
He spat
on [the] ground
and
made
clay
of
the
spittle
and
applied
to him
the
clay
to
the
eyes
And
He said
to him
Go
wash
in
the
pool
-
of Siloam
which
means
Sent
He went
therefore
and
washed
and
came [back]
seeing
The
therefore
neighbors
and
those
having seen
him
-
before
that
a beggar
he was
were saying
Not
this
is
he who
was sitting
and
begging
Some
were saying
-
He
it is
but others
were saying
No
but
like
him
he is
He
kept saying
-
I
am [he]
They were saying
therefore
to him
How
then
were opened
of you
the
eyes
Answered
He
The
man
-
called
Jesus
clay
made
and
anointed
of me
the
eyes
and
He said
to me
-
Go
to
-
Siloam
and
wash
Having gone
therefore
and
having washed
I received sight
And
they said
to him
Where
is
He
He says
Not
I know
They bring
him
to
the
Pharisees
who
once [was]
blind
Was
now
Sabbath
in
which
day
the
clay
had made
-
Jesus
and
opened
of him
the
eyes
Again
therefore
were asking
him
also
the
Pharisees
how
he had received sight
-
And
he said
to them
Clay
He put
of me
on
the
eyes
and
I washed
and
I see
Were saying
therefore
of
the
Pharisees
some
Not
is
this
from
God
the
man
for
the
Sabbath
not
He does keep
Others
were saying
How
is able
a man
sinful
such
signs
to do
And
division
there was
among
them
They say
therefore
to the
blind [man]
again
What
you
say
concerning
Him
for
He opened
of you
the
eyes
-
And
he said
-
A prophet
He is
Not
did believe
then
the
Jews
concerning
him
that
he had been
blind
and
had received sight
until
when
they called
the
parents
of him
-
having received sight
And
they asked
them
saying
This
is
the
son
of you
of whom
you
say
that
blind
he was born
How
then
does he see
presently
Answered
therefore
the
parents
of him
and
said
We know
that
this
is
the
son
of us
and
that
blind
he was born
How
however
presently
he sees
not
we know
or
who
opened
of him
the
eyes
we
not
know
him
ask
age
has
He
Concerning
himself
he will speak
These things
said
the
parents
of Him
because
they were afraid
of the
Jews
already
for
had agreed together
the
Jews
that
if
anyone
Him
should confess
Christ
expelled from the synagogue
he would be
Because of
this
the
parents
of him
said
-
Age
he has
him
ask
They called
therefore
the
man
out
a second time
who
had been
blind
and
said
to him
Give
glory
-
to God
We
know
that
this
-
man
a sinner
is
Answered
then
he
Whether
a sinner
He is
not
I know
One [thing]
I do know
that
blind
being
now
I see
They said
therefore
to him
What
did He
to you
How
opened He
of you
the
eyes
He answered
them
I told
you
already
and
not
you did listen
Why
again
do you wish
to hear
Not
also
you
do wish
His
disciples
to become
And
they railed at
him
and
said
You
a disciple
are
of that One
we
however
-
of Moses
are
disciples
We
know
that
to Moses
has spoken
-
God
this [man]
however
not
we know
from where
is
Answered
the
man
and
said
to them
In
this
for
-
an amazing thing
is
that
you
not
know
from where
He is
and yet
He opened
my
-
eyes
We know
that
-
God
sinners
not
does hear
but
if
anyone
God-fearing
is
and
the
will
of Him
does
him
He hears
Out of
the
age
never
it has been heard
that
opened
anyone
[the] eyes
of [one] blind
having been born
If
not
were
this [man]
from
God
not
He could
do
nothing
They answered
and
said
to him
In
sins
you
were born
entirely
and
you
teach
us
And
they cast
him
out
Heard
Jesus
that
they had cast
him
out
and
having found
him
He said
You
believe
in
the
Son
of
Man
Answered
he
and
said
And
who
is He
Lord
that
I may believe
in
Him
Said
to him
-
Jesus
Both
You have seen
Him
and
the [One]
speaking
with
you
He
is
-
And
he was saying
I believe
Lord
And
he worshiped
Him
And
said
-
Jesus
For
judgment
I
into
the
world
this
came
that
those
not
seeing
may see
and
those
seeing
blind
may become
Heard
of
the
Pharisees
these things
who
with
Him
were
and
they said
to Him
Not
also
we
blind
are
Said
to them
-
Jesus
If
blind
you were
not
-
you would have
sin
since
however
you say
-
We see
the
sin
of you
remains
Truly
truly
I say
to you
the [one]
not
entering in
by
the
door
to
the
fold
of the
sheep
but
climbing up
another way
he
a thief
is
and
a robber
The [one]
however
entering in
by
the
door
shepherd
is
of the
sheep
To him
the
doorkeeper
opens
and
the
sheep
the
voice
of him
hear
and
the
own
sheep
he calls
by
name
and
leads out
them
When
the
own
all
he has brought out
before
them
he goes
and
the
sheep
him
follow
because
they know
the
voice
of him
A stranger
however
in no way
not
they will follow
but
will flee
from
him
because
not
they recognize
-
of strangers
the
voice
This
-
allegory
spoke
to them
-
Jesus
they
however
not
knew
what
it was
that
He was saying
to them
Said
therefore
again
-
Jesus
Truly
truly
I say
to you
-
I
am
the
door
of the
sheep
All
who ever
came
before
Me
thieves
are
and
robbers
but
not
did hear
them
the
sheep
I
am
the
door
by
Me
if
anyone
enters in
he will be saved
and
he will go in
and
will go out
and
pasture
will find
The
thief
not
comes
if
not
that
he might steal
and
might kill
and
might destroy
I
came
that
life
they may have
and
abundantly
may have [it]
I
am
the
shepherd
-
good
The
shepherd
-
good
the
life
of Him
lays down
for
the
sheep
the
hired servant
however
not
being
[the] shepherd
whose
not
are
the
sheep
own
sees
the
wolf
coming
and
leaves
the
sheep
and
flees
and
the
wolf
snatches
them
and
scatters
because
a hired servant
he is
and
not
is himself concerned
to him
about
the
sheep
I
am
the
shepherd
-
good
and
I know
-
My own
and
am known
I
by
Mine
As
knows
Me
the
Father
I also
know
the
Father
and
the
life
of Me
I lay down
for
the
sheep
And
other
sheep
I have
which
not
are
of
the
fold
this
those also
it behooves
Me
to bring
and
the
voice
of Me
they will hear
and
there will be
one
flock
with one
shepherd
Because of
this
Me
the
Father
loves
because
I
lay down
the
life
of Me
that
again
I might take
it
No one
takes
it
from
Me
but
I
lay down
it
of
Myself
Authority
I have
to lay down
it
and
authority
I have
again
to take
it
This
-
commandment
I received
from
the
Father
of Me
Division
again
there was
among
the
Jews
on account of
the
words
these
Were saying
now
many
of
them
A demon
He has
and
is insane
why
Him
do you listen to
Others
were saying
These
-
sayings
not
are [those]
of one possessed by a demon
Not
a demon
is able
of [the] blind
[the] eyes
to open
Took place
at the time
the
Feast of Dedication
at
-
Jerusalem
Winter
it was
and
was walking
-
Jesus
in
the
temple
in
the
porch
-
of Solomon
Encircled
therefore
Him
the
Jews
and
they were saying
to Him
Until
when
the
soul
of us
hold You in suspense
If
You
are
the
Christ
tell
us
plainly
Answered
them
-
Jesus
I told
you
and
not
you believe
The
works
that
I
do
in
the
name
of the
Father
of Me
these
bear witness
concerning
Me
But
you
not
believe
because
not
you are
from among
the
sheep
-
of Me
The
sheep
-
of Me
the
voice
of Me
hear
and I
know
them
and
they follow
Me
and I
give
them
life
eternal
and
never
not
shall they perish
to
the
age
and
never
will seize
anyone
them
out of
the
hand
of Me
The
Father
of Me
who
has given [them]
to Me
than all
greater
is
and
no one
is able
to seize [them]
out of
the
hand
the
Father
I
and
the
Father
one
are
Took up
again
stones
the
Jews
that
they might stone
Him
Answered
them
-
Jesus
Many
works
I have shown
you
good
from
the
Father
because of
which
of these
work
Me
do you stone
Answered
Him
the
Jews
For
a good
work
not
we do stone
You
but
for
blasphemy
and
because
You
a man
being
make
yourself
God
Answered
them
-
Jesus
Not
is it
written
in
the
law
of you
-
I
said
gods
you are
If
them
he called
gods
to
whom
the
word
-
of God
came
and
not
is able
to be broken
the
Scripture
[of Him] whom
the
Father
sanctified
and
sent
into
the
world
you
do say
-
You blaspheme
because
I said
Son
-
of God
I am
If
not
I do
the
works
of the
Father
of Me
not
believe
Me
If
however
I do
even if
Me
not
you believe
the
works
believe
so that
you may know
and
may understand
that
in
Me [is]
the
Father
and I
in
the
Father
They were seeking
therefore
Him
again
to seize
but
He went forth
out of
the
hand
of them
And
He departed
again
beyond
the
Jordan
to
the
place
where
was
John
-
at first
baptizing
And
He stayed
there
And
many
came
to
Him
and
were saying
-
John
indeed
sign
did
no
everything
however
that
said
John
about
this [man]
true
was
And
many
believed
in
Him
there
Was
now
a certain [man]
ailing
Lazarus
of
Bethany
of
the
village
of Mary
and
Martha
the
sister
of her
Was
now
Mary
the [one]
having anointed
the
Lord
with fragrant oil
and
having wiped
the
feet
of Him
with the
hair
of her
whose
-
brother
Lazarus
was sick
Sent
therefore
the
sisters
to
Him
saying
Lord
behold
[he] whom
You love
is sick
Having heard
then
-
Jesus
said
This
-
sickness
not
is
unto
death
but
for
the
glory
-
of God
that
may be glorified
the
Son
-
of God
by
it
Loved
now
-
Jesus
-
Martha
and
the
sister
of her
and
-
Lazarus
When
therefore
He heard
that
he is sick
then
indeed
He remained
in
which
He was
[the] place
two
days
Then
after
this
He says
to the
disciples
Let us go
into
-
Judea
again
Say
to Him
the
disciples
Rabbi
just now
were seeking
You
to stone
the
Jews
and
again
You are going
there
Answered
Jesus
Not
twelve
hours
are there
in the
day
If
anyone
walks
in
the
day
not
he stumbles
because
the
light
the
world
of this
he sees
if
however
anyone
walks
in
the
night
he stumbles
because
the
light
not
is
in
him
These things
He said
and
after
this
He says
to them
Lazarus
the
friend
of us
has fallen asleep
but
I go
that
I may awaken
him
Said
therefore
the
disciples
of Him
Lord
if
he has fallen asleep
he will get well
Had spoken
however
-
Jesus
of
the
death
of him
they
however
thought
that
of
the
rest
-
of sleep
He speaks
Then
therefore
said
to them
-
Jesus
plainly
Lazarus
has died
And
I rejoice
for sake of
you
in order that
you might believe
that
not
I was
there
But
let us go
to
him
Said
therefore
Thomas
-
called
Didymus
to the
fellow disciples
Let go
also
us
that
we may die
with
Him
Having come
therefore
-
Jesus
found
him
four
already
days
having been
in
the
tomb
Was
now
Bethany
near
-
Jerusalem
about
away
stadia
fifteen
Many
now
of
the
Jews
had come
unto
-
Martha
and
Mary
that
they might console
them
concerning
the
brother
-
Therefore
Martha
when
she heard
that
Jesus
is coming
met
Him
Mary
however
in
the
house
was sitting
Said
then
-
Martha
to
Jesus
Lord
if
You had been
here
not
-
would have died
the
brother
of me
even
now
I know
that
whatever
-
You might ask
-
God
will give
You
-
God
Says
to her
-
Jesus
Will rise again
the
brother
of you
Says
to him
-
Martha
I know
that
he will rise again
in
the
resurrection
in
the
last
day
Said
to her
-
Jesus
I
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
the [one]
believing
in
Me
even if
he should die
he will live
and
everyone
-
living
and
believing
in
Me
never
not
shall die
to
the
age
Believe you
this
She says
to Him
Yes
Lord
I
have believed
that
You
are
the
Christ
the
Son
-
of God
the [One]
into
the
world
coming
And
these things
having said
she went away
and
called
Mary
the
sister
of her
secretly
having said
The
Teacher
is come
and
He calls
you
She
then
when
she heard
rose up
quickly
and
was coming
to
Him
Not yet
now
had come
-
Jesus
into
the
village
but
was
still
in
the
place
where
had met
Him
-
Martha
The
then
Jews
-
being
with
her
in
the
house
and
consoling
her
having seen
-
Mary
that
quickly
she rose up
and
went out
followed
her
having supposed
-
she is going
to
the
tomb
that
she might weep
there
-
Therefore
Mary
when
she came
to where
was
Jesus
having seen
Him
fell
of Him
at
the
feet
saying
to Him
Lord
if
You had been
here
not
-
of me
would have died
the
brother
Jesus
therefore
when
He saw
her
weeping
and
the
having come with
her
Jews
weeping
He was deeply moved
-
in spirit
and
troubled
Himself
And
He said
Where
have you laid
him
They say
to Him
Lord
come
and
see
Wept
-
Jesus
Were saying
therefore
the
Jews
Behold
how
He loved
him
Some
however
of
them
said
Not
was able
this [man]
-
having opened
the
eyes
of the
blind
to have caused
that
also
this one
not
should have died
Jesus
therefore
again
being deeply moved
in
Himself
comes
to
the
tomb
It was
now
a cave
and
a stone
was lying
against
it
Says
-
Jesus
Take away
the
stone
Says
to Him
the
sister
of the [one]
having died
Martha
Lord
already
he stinks
four days
for
it is
Says
to her
-
Jesus
Not
said I
to you
that
if
you should believe
you will see
the
glory
-
of God
They took away
therefore
the
stone
-
Now
Jesus
lifted
His
eyes
upwards
and
said
Father
I thank
You
that
You have heard
Me
I
and
knew
that
always
Me
You hear
but
on account of
the
crowd
-
standing around
I said [it]
that
they may believe
that
You
Me
sent
And
these things
having said
in a voice
loud
He cried out
Lazarus
come
forth
Came forth
the [one]
having been dead
being bound
the
feet
and
the
hands
with linen strips
and
the
face
of him
in a headcloth
bound about
Says
to them
-
Jesus
Unbind
him
and
allow
him
to go
Many
therefore
of
the
Jews
-
having come
to
-
Mary
and
having seen
what
He did
believed
in
Him
some
however
of
them
went
to
the
Pharisees
and
told
them
what
had done
Jesus
Gathered
therefore
the
chief priests
and
the
Pharisees
a council
and
they were saying
What
are we to do
For
this
-
man
many
does
signs
If
we shall let him alone
Him
like this
all
will believe
in
Him
and
will come
the
Romans
and
will take away
of us
both
the
place
and
the
nation
One
however
certain
of
them
Caiaphas
high priest
being
the
year
same
said
to them
You
not
know
nothing
nor
consider you
that
it is profitable
for you
that
one
man
should die
for
the
people
and
not
all
the
nation
should perish
This
now
from
himself
not
he said
but
high priest
being
the
year
that
he prophesied
that
was about
Jesus
to die
for
the
nation
and
not
for
the
nation
only
but
that
also
the
children
-
of God
those
having been scattered
He might gather together
into
one
From
that
therefore
-
day
they took counsel together
that
they might kill
Him
-
Therefore
Jesus
no longer
publicly
walked
among
the
Jews
but
went away
from there
into
the
region
near
the
wilderness
to
Ephraim
called
a city
And there
He stayed
with
the
disciples
Was
now
near
the
Passover
of the
Jews
and
went up
many
to
Jerusalem
out of
the
region
before
the
Passover
so that
they might purify
themselves
They were seeking
therefore
-
Jesus
and
were saying
among
one another
in
the
temple
standing
What
does it seem
to you
that
no
not
He will come
to
the
feast
Had given
now
the
chief priests
and
the
Pharisees
a command
that
if
anyone
should know
where
He is
he should show [it]
so that
they might seize
Him
-
Therefore
Jesus
before
six
days
the
Passover
came
to
Bethany
where
was
Lazarus
whom
had raised
out from
[the] dead
Jesus
They made
therefore
Him
a supper
there
and
-
Martha
was serving
-
and
Lazarus
one
was
of
those
reclining
with
Him
-
Therefore
Mary
having taken
a litra
of fragrant oil
of nard
pure
of great price
anointed
the
feet
-
of Jesus
and
wiped
with the
hair
of her
the
feet
of Him
the
now
house
was filled
with
the
fragrance
of the
oil
Says
however
Judas
-
Iscariot
one
the
disciples
of Him
-
being about
Him
to betray
Because of
why
this
-
fragrant oil
not
was sold
for three hundred
denarii
and
given
to [the] poor
He said
however
this
not
because
for
the
poor
he was caring
to him
but
because
a thief
he was
and
the
money bag
having
that
being put into [it]
he used to pilfer
Said
therefore
-
Jesus
Leave alone
her
so that
for
the
day
of the
burial
of Me
she may keep
it
the
poor
for
always
you have
with
you
Me
however
not
always
you have
Knew
therefore
-
a crowd
great
of
the
Jews
that
there
He is
and
they came
not
because of
-
Jesus
only
but
that
also
-
Lazarus
they might see
whom
He had raised
out from
[the] dead
Took counsel
however
the
chief priests
that
also
-
Lazarus
they might kill
because
many
on account of
him
were going away
of the
Jews
and
were believing
in
-
Jesus
On the
next day
the
crowd
great
-
having come
to
the
feast
having heard
that
is coming
Jesus
into
Jerusalem
took
the
branches
of the
palm trees
and
went out
to
meet
Him
and
were shouting
Hosanna
Blessed is
the [One]
coming
in
[the] name
of [the] Lord
And
the
King
-
of Israel
Having found
then
-
Jesus
a young donkey
He sat
upon
it
as
it is
written
Not
fear
daughter
of Zion
Behold
the
King
of you
comes
sitting
on
a colt
of a donkey
These things
not
knew
of Him
the
disciples
from the
first
but
when
was glorified
Jesus
then
they remembered
that
these things
were
of
Him
written
and
these things
they had done
to Him
Continued to bear witness
therefore
the
crowd
-
being
with
Him
when
-
Lazarus
He called
out of
the
tomb
and
raised
him
out from
[the] dead
On account of
this
also
met
Him
the
crowd
because
they heard
this
of His
having done
the
sign
-
Therefore
the Pharisees
said
among
themselves
You see
that
not
you gain
nothing
Behold
the
world
after
Him
has gone
There were
now
Greeks
certain
among
those
coming up
that
they might worship
at
the
feast
these
therefore
came
to Philip
who was
from
Bethsaida
-
of Galilee
and
they were asking
him
saying
Sir
we desire
-
Jesus
to see
Comes
-
Philip
and
tells
-
Andrew
come
Andrew
and
Philip
and
tell
-
Jesus
-
And
Jesus
answered
them
saying
Has come
the
hour
that
should be glorified
the
Son
-
of Man
Truly
truly
I say
to you
if
not
the
grain
-
of wheat
having fallen
into
the
ground
should die
it
alone
abides
if
however
it should die
much
fruit
it bears
The [one]
loving
the
life
of him
loses
it
and
the [one]
hating
the
life
of him
in
the
world
this
to
life
eternal
will keep
it
If
Me
anyone
serves
Me
let him follow
and
where
am
I
there
also
the
servant
-
of Me
will be
If
anyone
Me
serves
will honor
him
the
Father
Now
the
soul
of Me
has been troubled
and
what
shall I say
Father
save
Me
from
the
hour
this
But
on account of
this
I came
to
the
hour
this
Father
glorify
of You
the
name
Came
therefore
a voice
from
-
heaven
Both
I have glorified [it]
and
again
I will glorify [it]
-
Therefore
the crowd
-
having stood
and
having heard
was saying
Thunder
there has been
Others
were saying
An angel
to Him
has spoken
Answered
Jesus
and
said
Not
because of
Me
the
voice
this
has come
but
because of
you
Now
[the] judgment
is
the
world
of this
now
the
prince
of the
world
this
will be cast
out
And I
if
I am lifted up
from
the
earth
all
will draw
to
Myself
This
now
He was saying
signifying
by what
death
He was about
to die
Answered
then
Him
the
crowd
We
have heard
from
the
law
that
the
Christ
abides
to
the
age
and
how
say
you
that
it behooves
to be lifted up
the
Son
-
of Man
Who
is
this
-
Son
-
of Man
Said
therefore
to them
-
Jesus
Yet
a little
while
the
light
with
you
is
Walk
while
the
light
you have
so that
not
darkness
you
might overtake
And
the [one]
walking
in
the
darkness
not
knows
where
he is going
While
the
light
you have
believe
in
the
light
so that
sons
of light
you may become
These things
spoke
Jesus
and
having gone away
He was hidden
from
them
So many
however
of Him
signs
having been done
before
them
not
they believed
in
Him
so that
the
word
of Isaiah
the
prophet
might be fulfilled
that
said
Lord
who
has believed
the
report
of us
And
the
arm
of [the] Lord
to whom
has been revealed
Because of
this
not
they were able
to believe
for
again
said
Isaiah
He has blinded
of them
the
eyes
and
has hardened
of them
the
heart
that
not
they should see
with the
eyes
and
understand
with the
heart
and
turn
and
I will heal
them
These things
said
Isaiah
because
he saw
the
glory
of Him
and
spoke
concerning
Him
Nevertheless
indeed
even
of
the
rulers
many
believed
in
Him
but
on account of
the
Pharisees
not
they were confessing
so that
not
put out of the synagogue
they might be
they loved
for
the
glory
-
of men
more
than
the
glory
-
of God
Jesus
then
cried out
and
said
The [one]
believing
in
Me
not
believes
in
Me
but
in
the [One]
having sent
Me
and
the [one]
beholding
Me
beholds
the [One]
having sent
Me
I
a light
into
the
world
have come
so that
everyone
-
believing
in
Me
in
the
darkness
not
should abide
And
if
anyone
of Me
hears
the
words
and
not
keeps [them]
I
not
do judge
him
not
for
I came
that
I might judge
the
world
but
that
I might save
the
world
The [one]
rejecting
Me
and
not
receiving
the
words
of Me
has
[one]
judging
him
The
word
which
I spoke
that
will judge
him
in
the
last
day
For
I
from
Myself
not
spoke
but
the
having sent
Me
Father
Himself
Me
a commandment
gave
what
I should say
and
what
I should speak
And
I know
that
the
commandment
of Him
life
eternal
is
What
therefore
I
speak
as
has said
to Me
the
Father
so
I speak
Before
now
the
feast
of the
Passover
knowing
-
Jesus
that
had come
His
-
hour
that
He would depart
out of
the
world
this
to
the
Father
having loved
the
own
who [were]
in
the
world
to
[the] end
He loved
them
And
supper
taking place
the
devil
already
having put
into
the
heart
that
he should betray
Him
of Judas
[son] of Simon
Iscariot
knowing
that
all things
has given
Him
the
Father
into
the
hands
and
that
from
God
He came forth
and
to
-
God
He is going
He rises
from
the
supper
and
lays aside
the
garments
And
having taken
a towel
He girded
Himself
After that
He pours
water
into
the
basin
and
He began
to wash
the
feet
of the
disciples
and
to wipe [them]
with the
towel
with which
He was
girded
He comes
then
to
Simon
Peter
who says
to Him
Lord
You
of me
do wash
the
feet
Answered
Jesus
and
said
to him
What
I
do
you
not
know
presently
you will know
however
after
these things
Says
to Him
Peter
No
not
shall You wash
of me
the
feet
to
the
age
Answered
Jesus
him
If
not
I wash
you
not
you have
part
with
Me
Says
to Him
Simon
Peter
Lord
not
the
feet
of me
only
but
also
the
hands
and
the
head
Says
to him
Jesus
The [one]
having been bathed
not
has
need
if
not
the
feet
to wash
but
is
clean
wholly
and
you all
clean
are
but
not
all
He knew
for
the [one who]
was betraying
Him
on account of
this
He said
-
Not
all
clean
you are
When
therefore
He had washed
the
feet
of them
and
taken
the
garments
of Him
and
having reclined
again
He said
to them
Do you know
what
I have done
to you
You
call
Me
-
Teacher
and
-
Lord
and
rightly
you say
I am
for
If
therefore
I
have washed
your
-
feet
the
Lord
and
the
Teacher
also
you
ought
of one another
to wash
the
feet
A pattern
for
I gave
you
that
as
I
did
to you
also
you
should do
Truly
truly
I say
to you
not
is
a servant
greater than
the
master
of him
nor
a messenger
greater than
the [one]
having sent
him
If
these things
you know
blessed
are you
if
you do
them
Not
about
all
of you
I speak
I
know
whom
I chose
but
that
the
Scripture
may be fulfilled
The [one]
eating
of Me
the
bread
lifted up
against
Me
the
heel
of him
From
this time
I am telling
you
before
-
it comes to pass
so that
you should believe
when
it comes to pass
that
I
am [He]
Truly
truly
I say
to you
the [one]
receiving
-
any
I shall send
Me
receives
the [one]
now
Me
receiving
receives
the [One]
having sent
Me
These things
having said
Jesus
was troubled
-
in spirit
and
He testified
and
said
Truly
truly
I say
to you
that
one
of
you
will betray
Me
Began to look
upon
one another
the
disciples
being uncertain
of
whom
He is speaking
There was
reclining
one
of
the
disciples
of Him
in
the
bosom
-
of Jesus
whom
loved
-
Jesus
Motions
therefore
to him
Simon
Peter
and
he tells
him
to ask
who
is
about
whom
He is speaking
Having leaned
he
thus
on
the
breast
-
of Jesus
he says
to Him
Lord
who
is it
Answers
then
-
Jesus
He
it is
to whom
I
will dip
the
morsel
and
will give
him
Having dipped
then
the
morsel
He takes [it]
and
gives [it]
to Judas
[son] of Simon
Iscariot
And
after
the
morsel
then
entered
into
him
-
Satan
Says
therefore
to him
Jesus
What
you do
do
quickly
This
now
no one
knew
of those
reclining
to
what
He spoke
to him
Some
for
were thinking
since
the
money bag
had
Judas
that
is saying
to him
Jesus
Buy
what things
need [of]
we have
for
the
feast
or
to the
poor
that
something
he should give
Having received
therefore
the
morsel
he
went out
immediately
it was
now
night
When
therefore
he had gone out
says
Jesus
Now
has been glorified
the
Son
-
of Man
and
-
God
has been glorified
in
Him
If
-
God
is glorified
in
Him
also
-
God
will glorify
Him
in
Himself
and
immediately
will glorify
Him
Little children
yet
a little while
with
you
I am
You will seek
Me
and
as
I said
to the
Jews
-
Where
I
go
you
not
are able
to come
also
to you
I say
now
A commandment
new
I give
to you
that
you should love
one another
as
I have loved
you
so
also
you
should love
one another
By
this
will know
all
that
to Me
disciples
you are
if
love
you have
among
one another
Says
to Him
Simon
Peter
Lord
where
go You
Answered
Jesus
Where
I go
not
you are able
Me
now
to follow
you will follow
however
afterward
Says
to Him
Peter
Lord
because of
why
not
am I able
You
to follow
presently
The
life
of me
for
You
I will lay down
Answered
Jesus
The
life
of you
for
Me
will you lay down
Truly
truly
I say
to you
no
not
[the] rooster
will crow
until
that
you will deny
Me
three times
Not
let be troubled
of you
the
heart
You believe
in
-
God
also
in
Me
believe
In
the
house
of the
Father
of Me
mansions
many
there are
if
now
not
would I have told
-
you
that
I go
to prepare
a place
for you
And
if
I go
and
prepare
a place
for you
again
I am coming
and
will receive
you
to
Myself
that
where
am
I
also
you
may be
And
to the place
I
am going
you know
the
way
Says
to Him
Thomas
Lord
not
we know
where
You are going
how
can we
the
way
Says
to him
Jesus
I
am
the
way
and
the
truth
and
the
life
No one
comes
to
the
Father
if
not
by
Me
If
you had known
Me
also
the
Father
of Me
-
you would have known
from
now
you know
Him
and
have seen
Says
to Him
Philip
Lord
show
us
the
Father
and
it is enough
for us
Says
to him
-
Jesus
So long
a time
with
you
am I
and
not
you have known
Me
Philip
The [one]
having seen
Me
has seen
the
Father
how
you
say
Show
us
the
Father
Not

that
I [am]
in
the
Father
and
the

in
Me
is
The
words
that
I
speak
to you
from
Myself
not
I speak

but
the Father
in
Me
dwelling
does

works
of Him
Believe
Me
that
I [am]
in

but
not
because of
the
works

believing
in
Me
the
works
that
I

also he
will do
and
greater
than these
he will do
because
I
to
the
Father
am going
And
-
what
ever
you might ask
in
the
name
of Me
this
will I do
so that
may be glorified
the
Father
in
the
Son
If
anything
you ask
Me
in
the
name
of Me
I
will do [it]
If

commandments

My

And I
will ask
the
Father
and
another
Helper
He will give
you
that
He may be
with
you
to
the
age
the
Spirit
-
of truth
whom
the
world
not
is able
to receive
because
not
it does see
Him
nor
know
But you
know
Him
for
with
you
He abides
and
in
you
He will be
Not
I will leave
you
as orphans
I am coming
to
you
Yet
a little while
and
the
world
Me
no more
sees
you

and
keeping
them
he
is
the [one]
loving
Me
the [one]
now
loving
Me
will be loved
by
the
Father
of Me
and I
will love
him
and
will show
to him
Myself
Says
to Him
Judas
not
-
Iscariot
Lord
then
what
has occurred
that
to us
You are about
to manifest
Yourself
and
not
to the
world
Answered
Jesus
and
said
to him
If
anyone
loves
Me
the
word
of Me
he will keep
and
the
Father
of Me
will love
him
and
to
him
we will come
and
a home
with
him
will make
The [one]
not
loving
Me
the
words
of Me
not
does keep
and
the
word
that
you hear
not
is
Mine
but
of the
having sent
Me
Father
These things
I have said
to you
with
you
abiding
The
however
Helper
the
Spirit
-
Holy
whom
will send
the
Father
in
the
name
of Me
He
you
will teach
all things
and
will bring to remembrance
of you
all things
that
have said
to you
I
Peace
I leave
with you
peace
-
My
I give
to you
not
as
the
world
gives
I
give
to you
Not
let be troubled
of you
the
heart
nor
let it fear
You heard
that
I
said
to you
I am going away
and
I am coming
to
you
If
you loved
Me
you would have rejoiced
-
that
I am going
to
the
Father
because
the
Father
greater than
I
is
And
now
I have told
you
before
it comes to pass
that
when
it shall have come to pass
you might believe
No longer
much
I will speak
with
you
comes
for
the
of this
world
ruler
and
in
Me
not
he has
nothing
but
that
may know
the
world
that
I love
the
Father
and
as
has commanded
Me
the
Father
thus
I do
Rise up
let us go
from here
I
am
the
vine
-
true
and
the
Father
of Me
the
vinedresser
is
Every
branch
in
Me
not
bearing
fruit
He takes away
it
and
every one
-
fruit
bearing
He prunes
it
that
fruit
more
it may bear
Already
you
clean
are
by reason of
the
word
that
I have spoken
to you
Abide
in
Me
and I
in
you
As
the
branch
not
is able
fruit
to bear
of
itself
if
not
it abide
in
the
vine
so
neither [can]
you
if
not
in
Me
you abide
I
am
the
vine
you [are]
the
branches
The [one]
abiding
in
Me
and I
in
him
he
bears
fruit
much
For
apart from
Me
not
you are able
to do
nothing
If
not
anyone
abide
in
Me
he is thrown
out
like
the
branch
and
is dried up
and
they gather
them
and
into
the
fire
cast
and
it is burned
If
you abide
in
Me
and
the
words
of Me
in
you
abide
whatever
if
you wish
you shall ask
and
it will come to pass
to you
In
this
is glorified
the
Father
of Me
that
fruit
much
you should bear
and
you shall be
to Me
disciples
As
has loved
Me
the
Father
I also
you
have loved
Abide
in
the
love
-
of Me
If
the
commandments
of Me
you keep
you will abide
in
the
love
of Me
as
I
the
Father
of Me
the
commandments
have kept
and
I abide
of Him
in
the
love
These things
I have spoken
to you
that
-
joy
-
My
in
you
may be
and
the
joy
of you
may be full
This
is
-
commandment
-
My
that
you love
one another
as
I loved
you
Greater
than this
love
no one
has
that
one
the
life
of him
should lay down
for
the
friends
of him
You
friends
of Me
are
if
you do
what
I
command
you
No longer
I call
you
servants
for
the
servant
not
knows
what
is doing
his
-
master
You
however
I have called
friends
because
all things
that
I heard
from
the
Father
of Me
I have made known
to you
Not
you
Me
chose
but
I
chose
you
and
appointed
you
that
you
should go
and
fruit
you should bear
and
the
fruit
of you
should remain
so that
-
what
ever
you might ask
the
Father
in
the
name
of Me
He may give
you
These things
I command
you
that
you love
one another
If
the
world
you
hates
you know
that
Me
before
you
it has hated
If
of
the
world
you were
the
world
-
[as] its
own
would love [you]
because
however
of
the
world
not
you are
but
I
chose
you
out of
the
world
on account of
this
hates
you
the
world
Remember
the
word
that
I
said
to you
Not
is
a servant
greater than
the
master
of him
If
Me
they persecuted
also
you
they will persecute
if
the
word
of Me
they kept
also
-
yours
they will keep
But
these things
all
they will do
against
you
on account of
the
name
of Me
because
not
they have known
the [One]
having sent
Me
If
not
I had come
and
spoken
to them
sin
not
they would have had
now
however
excuse
not
they have
for
the
sin
of them
The [one]
Me
hating
also
the
Father
of Me
hates
If
the
works
not
I had done
among
them
that
no
other
has done
sin
not
they would have had
now
however
both
they have seen
and
have hated
both
Me
and
the
Father
of Me
But [this is]
that
may be fulfilled
the
word
-
in
the
law
of them
having been written
-
They hated
Me
without cause
When
comes
the
Helper
whom
I
will send
to you
from
the
Father
the
Spirit
-
of truth
who
from
the
Father
goes forth
He
will bear witness
concerning
Me
Also
you
now
bear witness
because
from
[the] beginning
with
Me
you are
These things
I have spoken
to you
that
not
you might fall away
Out of the synagogues
they will put
you
but
is coming
an hour
that
everyone
-
having killed
you
will think
[it is] a service
to offer
-
to God
And
these things
they will do
because
not
they know
the
Father
nor
Me
But
these things
I have said
to you
so that
when
might have come
the
hour
of them
you may remember
them
that
I
said [them]
to you
These things
now
to you
from
[the] beginning
not
I said
because
with
you
I was
Now
however
I go
to
the [One]
having sent
Me
and
none
of
you
asks
Me
Where
are You going
But
because
these things
I have said
to you
-
sorrow
has filled
your
-
heart
But
I
the
truth
say
to you
it is profitable
for you
that
I
should go away
If
for
not
I go away
the
Helper
no
not at all
will come
to
you
if
however
I go
I will send
Him
to
you
And
having come
He
will convict
the
world
concerning
sin
and
concerning
righteousness
and
concerning
judgment
concerning
sin
indeed
because
not
do they believe
in
Me
concerning
righteousness
now
because
to
the
Father
I go away
and
no more
you behold
Me
concerning
now
judgment
because
the
ruler
of the
world
this
has been judged
Yet
many things
I have
to you
to say
but
not
you are able
to bear them
now
When
however
shall come
He
the
Spirit
-
of truth
He will guide
you
into
the
truth
all
not
for
He will speak
from
Himself
but
whatever
He may hear
He will speak
and
the things
coming
He will declare
to you
He
Me
will glorify
for
from
that which [is]
Mine
He will take
and
will disclose
to you
All things
whatever
has
the
Father
Mine
are
because of
this
I said
that
from
that which [is]
Mine
He will take
and
will disclose
to you
A little [while]
and
no longer
you do behold
Me
and
again
a little [while]
and
you will see
Me
Said
therefore
[some] of
the
disciples
of him
to
one another
What
is
this
that
He says
to us
A little [while]
and
not
you do behold
Me
and
again
a little [while]
and
you will see
Me
and
Because
I am going
to
the
Father
They were saying
therefore
This
what
is
that
He says
a
little [while]
Not
we do know
what
He is saying
Knew
Jesus
that
they were desiring
Him
to ask
and
He said
to them
Concerning
this
do you inquire
among
one another
that
I said
A little [while]
and
not
you do behold
Me
and
again
a little [while]
and
you will see
Me
Truly
truly
I say
to you
that
will weep
and
will lament
you
-
but
the world
will rejoice
You
will be grieved
but
the
grief
of you
to
joy
will turn
The
woman
when
she is giving birth
pain
has
because
has come
the
hour
of her
when
however
she brings forth
the
child
no longer
she remembers
the
tribulation
on account of
the
joy
that
has been born
a man
into
the
world
Also
you
therefore
now
indeed
grief
have
again
however
I will see
you
and
will rejoice
your
-
heart
and
the
joy
of you
no one
will take
from
you
And
in
that
-
day
of Me
not
you will ask
nothing
Truly
truly
I say
to you
-
whatever
you may ask
the
Father
He will give
you
in
the
name
of Me
Until
now
not
you have asked
nothing
in
the
name
of Me
Ask
and
you will receive
that
the
joy
of you
may be
full
These things
in
allegories
I have spoken
to you
is coming
an hour
when
no more
in
allegories
I will speak
to you
but
plainly
concerning
the
Father
I will report
to you
In
that
-
day
in
the
name
of Me
you will ask
and
not
I say
to you
that
I
will implore
the
Father
for
you
Himself
for
the
Father
loves
you
because
you
Me
have loved
and
have believed
that
I
from
-
God
came forth
I came forth
from
the
Father
and
have come
into
the
world
again
I leave
the
world
and
go
to
the
Father
Say
the
disciples
of Him
Behold
now
in
openness
You speak
and
allegory
not
speak
Now
we know
that
You know
all things
and
not
need
have
that
anyone
You
should ask
In
this
we believe
that
from
God
You came forth
Answered
them
Jesus
Now
do you believe
Behold
is coming
an hour
and
has come
when
you will be scattered
each
to
the
own
and I
alone
you shall leave
yet
not
I am
alone
for
the
Father
with
Me
is
These things
I have spoken
to you
so that
in
Me
peace
you may have
In
the
world
tribulation
you have
But
take courage
I
have overcome
the
world
These things
spoke
Jesus
and
having lifted up
the
eyes
of Him
to
-
heaven
He said
Father
has come
the
hour
glorify
Your
-
Son
that
the
Son
may glorify
You
As
You gave
Him
authority
over all
flesh
so that
all
whom
You have given
Him
He may give
to them
life
eternal
This
now
is
-
eternal
life
that
they may know
You
the
only
true
God
and
whom
You have sent
Jesus
Christ
I
You
glorified
on
the
earth
the
work
having completed
that
You have given
Me
that
I should do
And
now
glorify
Me
You
Father
with
Yourself
with the
glory
that
I had
before
-
the
world
existed
with
You
I revealed
Your
-
name
to the
men
whom
You have given
Me
out of
the
world
Yours
they were
and to Me
them
You gave
and
the
word
of You
they have kept
Now
they have known
that
all things
whatever
You have given
Me
of
You
are
for
the
words
that
You have given
Me
I have given
them
and
they
received [them]
and
knew
truly
that
from
You
I came forth
and
they believed
that
You
Me
sent
I
concerning
them
am praying
Not
concerning
the
world
do I pray
but
concerning
those whom
You have given
Me
for
Yours
they are
And
things
of mine
all
Yours
are
and
-
Yours
Mine
and
I have been glorified
in
them
And
no longer
I am
in
the
world
and yet
themselves
in
the
world
they are
and I
to
You
am coming
Father
Holy
keep
them
in
the
name
of You
which
You have given
Me
that
they may be
one
as
we [are]
When
I was
with
them
I
was keeping
them
in
the
name
of You
which
You have given
Me
And
I guarded [them]
and
none
of
them
has perished
if
not
the
son
-
of destruction
that
the
Scripture
might be fulfilled
Now
however
to
You
I am coming
and
these things
I speak
in
the
world
so that
they may have
-
joy
-
My
fulfilled
within
them
I
have given
them
the
word
of You
and
the
world
hated
them
because
not
they are
of
the
world
even as
I
not
am
of
the
world
Not
I do ask
that
You should take
them
out of
the
world
but
that
You should keep
them
from
-
evil
Of
the
world
not
they are
as
I
not
am
of
the
world
Sanctify
them
by
the
truth
the
word
-
of You
truth
is
As
Me
You sent
into
the
world
I also
sent
them
into
the
world
and
for
them
I
sanctify
Myself
that
may be
also
they
sanctified
in
truth
Not
for
these
however
do I ask
only
but
also
for
those
believing
through
the
word
of them
in
Me
that
all
one
may be
as
You
Father
[are] in
Me
and I
in
You
that
also
they
in
Us
may be
that
the
world
may believe
that
You
Me
sent
And I
the
glory
which
You have given
Me
have given
them
so that
they may be
one
as
We
[are] one
I
in
them
and
You
in
Me
that
they may be
perfected
in
unity
so that
may know
the
world
that
You
Me
sent
and
loved
them
even as
Me
You loved
Father
[those] whom
You have given
Me
I desire
that
where
am
I
they also
may be
with
Me
that
they may behold
-
glory
-
My
that
You gave
Me
because
You loved
Me
before
[the] foundation
of [the] world
Father
righteous
although
the
world
You
not
has known
I
now
You
have known
and
these
have known
that
You
Me
sent
And
I made known
to them
the
name
of You
and
will make [it] known
so that
the
love
with which
You loved
Me
in
them
may be
and I
in
them
These things
having said
Jesus
went out
with
the
disciples
of Him
beyond
the
winter stream
-
of Kidron
where
there was
a garden
into
which
entered
He
and
the
disciples
of Him
Knew
now
also
Judas
who
was delivering up
Him
the
place
because
often
gathered together
Jesus
there
with
the
disciples
of Him
-
Therefore
Judas
having procured
the
cohort
and
from
the
chief priests
and
from
the
Pharisees
officers
comes
there
with
lanterns
and
torches
and
weapons
Jesus
therefore
knowing
all things
that
are coming
upon
Him
having gone forth
also
said
to them
Whom
seek you
They answered
Him
Jesus
of
Nazareth
He says
to them
I
am [He]
Had been standing
now
also
Judas
who
is delivering up
Him
with
them
When
therefore
He said
to them
I
am [He]
they drew
toward
the
back
and
fell
to [the] ground
Again
therefore
He questioned
them
Whom
seek you
-
And
they said
Jesus
of
Nazareth
Answered
Jesus
I have told
you
that
I
am [He]
If
therefore
Me
you seek
Allow
these
to go away
so that
might be fulfilled
the
word
that
He had spoken
-
Those whom
You have given
Me
not
I lost
of
them
not one
Simon
then
Peter
having
a sword
drew
it
and
struck
the
of the
high priest
servant
and
cut off
of him
the
ear
-
right
Was
now
name
of the
servant
Malchus
Said
therefore
-
Jesus
-
to Peter
Put
the
sword
into
the
sheath
The
cup
which
has given
Me
the
Father
no
not
shall I drink
it
-
Then
the cohort
and
the
commander
and
the
officers
of the
Jews
took hold of
-
Jesus
and
bound
Him
and
they led [Him] away
to
Annas
first
he was
for
father-in-law
-
of Caiaphas
who
was
high priest
the
year
same
Was
now
Caiaphas
the [one]
having given counsel
to the
Jews
that
it is profitable
for one
man
to perish
for
the
people
Were following
now
-
Jesus
Simon
Peter
and
the other
disciple
Since
now
disciple
that
was
known
to the
high priest
also
he entered with
-
Jesus
into
the
court
of the
high priest
-
But
Peter
stood
at
the
door
outside
Went out
therefore
the
disciple
-
other
who was
known
to the
high priest
and
spoke
to the
doorkeeper
and
brought in
-
Peter
Says
therefore
-
to Peter
the
servant girl
the
doorkeeper
Not
also
you
of
the
disciples
are
of the
man
this
Says
he
Not
I am
Were standing
now
the
servants
and
the
officers
a fire of coals
having made
for
cold
it was
and
they were warming themselves
Was
now
also
-
Peter
with
them
standing
and
warming himself
-
Then
the high priest
questioned
-
Jesus
concerning
the
disciples
of Him
and
concerning
the
teaching
of Him
Answered
him
Jesus
I
openly
have spoken
to the
world
I
always
taught
in
[the] synagogue
and
in
the
temple
where
all
the
Jews
come together
and
in
secret
I spoke
nothing
Why
Me
do you question
Question
those
having heard
what
I spoke
to them
behold
they
know
what
said
I
These things
now
of Him
having said
one
standing by
of the
officers
gave
a blow with the palm
-
to Jesus
having said
Thus
answer You
the
high priest
Answered
him
Jesus
If
evil
I spoke
bear witness
concerning
the
evil
if
however
rightly
why
Me
strike you
Sent
then
Him
-
Annas
bound
to
Caiaphas
the
high priest
Was
now
Simon
Peter
standing
and
warming himself
They said
therefore
to him
Not
also
you
of
the
disciples
of Him
are
Denied
he
and
said
Not
I am
Says
one
of
the
servants
of the
high priest
kinsman
being [of him]
of whom
had cut off
Peter
the
ear
Not
I
you
saw
in
the
garden
with
Him
Again
then
denied
Peter
and
immediately
a rooster
crowed
They are leading
then
-
Jesus
from
-
Caiaphas
into
the
Praetorium
It was
now
early
and
they
not
entered
into
the
Praetorium
so that
not
they should be defiled
but
might eat
the
Passover
Went
therefore
-
Pilate
out
to
them
and
said
What
accusation
bring you
the
man
this
They answered
and
said
to him
If
not
were
He
evil
doing
not
-
to you
we would have delivered
Him
Said
therefore
to them
-
Pilate
Take
Him
yourselves
and
according to
the
law
of you
judge
Him
Said
to him
the
Jews
To us
not
it is permitted
to put to death
no one
that
the
word
-
of Jesus
might be fulfilled
which
He had spoken
signifying
what
death
He was about
to die
Entered
therefore
again
into
the
Praetorium
-
Pilate
and
he called
-
Jesus
and
said
to Him
You
are
the
King
of the
Jews
Answered
Jesus
Of
yourself
you
this
say
or
others
did say [it]
to you
concerning
Me
Answered
-
Pilate
Not
I
a Jew
am
The
nation
-
of You
and
the
chief priests
delivered
You
to me
What
have You done
Answered
Jesus
The
kingdom
-
My
not
is
of
the
world
this
if
of
the
world
this
were
-
kingdom
-
My
-
attendants
-
-
My
would fight
that
not
I might be betrayed
to the
Jews
Now
however
-
kingdom
-
My
not
is
from here
Said
therefore
to Him
-
Pilate
Then
a king
are
You
Answered
-
Jesus
You
say
that
a king
I am
I
for
this
have been born
and
for
this
I have come
into
the
world
that
I may bear witness
to the
truth
Everyone
-
being
of
the
truth
hears
of Me
the
voice
Says
to Him
-
Pilate
What
is
truth
And
this
having said
again
he went out
to
the
Jews
and
says
to them
I
no
find
in
Him
guilt
It is
however
a custom
with you
that
one
I should release
to you
at
the
Passover
wish you
therefore
I should release
to you
the
King
of the
Jews
They cried out
then
again
saying
Not
this one
but
-
Barabbas
Was
now
-
Barabbas
an insurrectionist
At that time
therefore
took
-
Pilate
-
Jesus
and
flogged [Him]
And
the
soldiers
having twisted together
a crown
of
thorns
put [it] on
of Him
the
head
and
a robe
purple
cast around
Him
and
they began coming up
to
Him
and
saying
Hail
-
King
of the
Jews
And
they kept giving
Him
blows with the palm
And
went forth
again
outside
-
Pilate
and
he says
to them
Behold
I bring
to you
Him
out
so that
you may know
that
no
guilt
I find
in
Him
Went forth
therefore
-
Jesus
outside
wearing
the
thorny
crown
and
the
purple
robe
And
he says
to them
Behold
the
man
When
therefore
saw
Him
the
chief priests
and
the
officers
they cried out
saying
Crucify
Crucify
Says
to them
-
Pilate
Take
Him
yourselves
and
crucify [Him]
I
for
no
find
in
Him
guilt
Answered
him
the
Jews
We
a law
have
and
according to
the
law
He ought
to die
because
[the] Son
of God
Himself
He made
When
therefore
heard
-
Pilate
this
-
word
[the] more
he was afraid
And
he went
into
the
Praetorium
again
and
he says
-
to Jesus
From where
are
You
-
But
Jesus
an answer
not
did give
him
Says
therefore
to Him
-
Pilate
To me
not
speak You
Not
know You
that
authority
I have
to release
You
and
authority
I have
to crucify
You
Answered
Jesus
Not
you would have
authority
also
Me
against
if
not
it were
given
to you
from above
Because of
this
the [one]
having delivered up
Me
to you
greater
sin
has
Out of
this
-
Pilate
was seeking
to release
Him
-
but
the Jews
cried out
saying
If
this [man]
you release
not
you are
a friend
-
of Caesar
Everyone
-
a king
himself
making
speaks against
-
Caesar
-
Therefore
Pilate
having heard
the
words
these
brought
out
-
Jesus
and
sat down
upon
[the] judgment seat
at
a place
called
[the] Stone Pavement
in Hebrew
now
Gabbatha
It was
now
the Day of Preparation
of the
Passover
[the] hour
was
about
the sixth
And
he says
to the
Jews
Behold
the
king
of you
They cried out
therefore
With Him
away
away
Crucify
Him
Says
to them
-
Pilate
The
King
of you
shall I crucify
Answered
the
chief priests
Not
we have
a king
if
not
Caesar
Then
therefore
he delivered
Him
to them
that
He might be crucified
They took
therefore
-
Jesus
And
bearing
[His] own
-
cross
He went out
to
the
called
of the Skull
Place
which
is called
in Hebrew
Golgotha
where
Him
they crucified
and
with
Him
others
two
on this side
and
on that side
in between
now
-
Jesus
Wrote
then
also
a title
-
Pilate
and
put [it]
on
the
cross
It was
now
written
Jesus
of
Nazareth
the
King
of the
Jews
This
therefore
the
title
many
read
of the
Jews
for
near
was
the
place
the
city
where
was crucified
-
Jesus
and
it was
written
in Hebrew
in Latin
in Greek
Were saying
therefore
-
to Pilate
the
chief priests
of the
Jews
Not
write
The
King
of the
Jews
but
that
He
said
King
I am
of the
Jews
Answered
-
Pilate
What
I have written
I have written
The
then
soldiers
when
they crucified
-
Jesus
took
the
garments
of Him
and
made
four
parts
to each
soldier
a part
and also
the
tunic
Was
now
the
tunic
seamless
from
the
top
woven
throughout
all
They said
therefore
to
one another
Not
let us tear up
it
but
let us cast lots
for
it
whose
it will be
that
the
Scripture
might be fulfilled
They divided
the
garments
of Me
among them
and
for
the
clothing
of Me
they cast
a lot
The
indeed
therefore
soldiers
these things
did
Had been standing
now
by
the
cross
-
of Jesus
the
mother
of Him
and
the
sister
of the
mother
of Him
Mary
the [wife]
-
of Clopas
and
Mary
-
Magdalene
Jesus
therefore
having seen
[His]
mother
and
the
disciple
standing by
whom
He loved
says
to
[His] mother
Woman
behold
the
son
of you
Then
He says
to the
disciple
Behold
the
mother
of you
And
from
that
-
hour
took
the
disciple
her
to
the
own
After
this
knowing
-
Jesus
that
now
all things
had been accomplished
so that
might be fulfilled
the
Scripture
He says
I thirst
A vessel
had been set [there]
of sour wine
full
a sponge
therefore
filled
with
sour wine
a stalk of hyssop
having put on
they brought
it
to the
mouth
When
therefore
took
the
sour wine
-
Jesus
He said
It has been finished
And
having bowed
the
head
He yielded up
the
spirit
-
Therefore
the Jews
because
[the] Preparation
it was
so that
not
would remain
on
the
cross
the
bodies
on
the
Sabbath
was
for
a high
-
day
that
-
Sabbath
asked
-
Pilate
that
might be broken
their
-
legs
and
they might be taken away
Came
therefore
the
soldiers
and
of the
indeed
first
broke
the
legs
and
of the
other
-
having been crucified with
Him
to
however
-
Jesus
having come
when
they saw
already
Him
having been dead
not
they did break
His
-
legs
But
one
of the
soldiers
with a spear
His
-
side
pierced
and
came out
immediately
blood
and
water
And
the [one]
having seen
has borne witness
and
true
of him
is
the
testimony
And
He
knows
that
truth
he is speaking
that
also
you
might believe
Took place
for
these things
so that
the
Scripture
might be fulfilled
Bone
not one
will be broken
of Him
And
again
another
Scripture
says
They will look
on
the [One]
they have pierced
After
then
these things
asked
-
Pilate
Joseph
from
Arimathea
being
a disciple
-
of Jesus
concealed
however
through
the
fear
of the
Jews
that
he might take away
the
body
-
of Jesus
and
gave permission
-
Pilate
He came
therefore
and
took away
the
body
of Him
Came
now
also
Nicodemus
the [one]
having come
to
Him
by night
at the
first
bearing
a mixture
of myrrh
and
aloes
about
litras
a hundred
They took
therefore
the
body
-
of Jesus
and
bound
it
in linen cloths
with
the
spices
as
[the] custom
is
among the
Jews
to prepare for burial
There was
now
in
the
place
where
He was crucified
a garden
and
in
the
garden
a tomb
new
in
which
not yet
no one
was
laid
There
therefore
on account of
the
Preparation
of the
Jews
because
near
was
the
tomb
they laid
-
Jesus
-
Now
the first [day]
of the
week
Mary
-
Magdalene
comes
early
dark
still
it being
to
the
tomb
and
she sees
the
stone
having been removed
from
the
tomb
She runs
therefore
and
comes
to
Simon
Peter
and
to
the
other
disciple
whom
loved
-
Jesus
and
she says
to them
They have taken away
the
Lord
out of
the
tomb
and
not
we know
where
they have laid
Him
Went forth
therefore
-
Peter
and
the
other
disciple
and
were coming
to
the
tomb
Were running
now
the
two
together
and
the
other
disciple
ran ahead
faster
-
than Peter
and
came
first
to
the
tomb
And
having stooped down
he sees
lying [there]
the
linen cloths
not
however
he entered
Comes
then
also
Simon
Peter
following
him
and
he entered
into
the
tomb
and
sees
the
linen cloths
lying [there]
and
the
soudarion
which
was
upon
the
head
of Him
not
with
the
linen cloths
lying
but
by itself
having been folded up
in
a
place
Then
therefore
entered
also
the
other
disciple
-
having come
first
to
the
tomb
and
he saw
and
believed
not yet
for
understood they
the
Scripture
that
it behooves
Him
out from
[the] dead
to rise
Went away
therefore
again
to
their [homes]
the
disciples
Mary
however
stood
at
the
tomb
outside
weeping
As
therefore
she was weeping
she stooped down
into
the
tomb
and
she sees
two
angels
in
white
sitting
one
at
the
head
and
one
at
the
feet
where
had lain
the
body
-
of Jesus
And
say
to her
they
Woman
why
weep you
She says
to them
Because
they have taken away
the
Lord
of me
and
not
I know
where
they have laid
Him
These things
having said
she turned
back
-
around
and
she sees
-
Jesus
standing [there]
and
not
had known
that
Jesus
it is
Says
to her
Jesus
Woman
why
do you weep
Whom
do you seek
She
thinking
that
the
gardener
He is
says
to Him
Sir
if
you
have carried off
him
tell
me
where
you have laid
Him
and I
him
will take away
Says
to her
Jesus
Mary
Having turned around
she
says
to Him
in Hebrew
Rabboni
that
is to say
Teacher
Says
to her
Jesus
Not
Me
touch
not yet
for
have I ascended
to
the
Father
go
however
to
the
brothers
of Me
and
say
to them
I am ascending
to
the
Father
of Me
and
Father
of you
and [to]
God
of Me
and
God
of you
Comes
Mary
-
Magdalene
bringing word
to the
disciples
-
I have seen
the
Lord
and [that]
these things
He had said
to her
It being
therefore
evening
the
day
same
the
first
of [the] week
and
the
doors
having been shut
where
were
the
disciples
through
the
fear
of the
Jews
came
-
Jesus
and
stood
in
the
midst
and
He says
to them
Peace
to you
And
this
having said
He showed
both
His
hands
and
His
side
to them
Rejoiced
then
the
disciples
having seen
the
Lord
Said
therefore
to them
-
Jesus
again
Peace
to you
as
has sent forth
me
the
Father
I also
send
you
And
this
having said
He breathed on [them]
and
He says
to them
Receive
[the] Spirit
Holy
If
of any
you might forgive
the
sins
they are forgiven
them
If
any
you might retain
they are retained
Thomas
however
one
of
the
Twelve
the [one]
called
Didymus
not
was
with
them
when
came
Jesus
Were saying
therefore
to him
the
other
disciples
We have seen
the
Lord
-
But
he said
to them
If
not
I see
in
the
hands
of Him
the
mark
of the
nails
and
put
the
finger
of me
into
the
mark
of the
nails
and
put
of me
the
hand
into
the
side
of Him
no
not
will I believe
And
after
days
eight
again
were
inside
the
disciples
of Him
and
Thomas
with
them
Comes
-
Jesus
the
doors
having been shut
And
He stood
in
the
midst
and
said
Peace
to you
Then
He says
-
to Thomas
Bring
the
finger
of you
here
and
see
the
hands
of Me
and
bring
the
hand
of you
and
put [it]
into
the
side
of Me
and
not
be
unbelieving
but
believing
Answered
Thomas
and
said
to Him
The
Lord
of Me
and
the
God
of me
Says
to him
-
Jesus
Because
you have seen
Me
you have believed
blessed [are]
those
not
having seen
yet
having believed
Many
indeed
therefore
also
other
signs
did
-
Jesus
in the presence
of the
disciples
which
not
are
written
in
the
book
this
these
however
have been written
that
you may believe
that
Jesus
is
the
Christ
the
Son
-
of God
and
that
believing
life
you may have
in
the
name
of Him
After
these things
revealed
Himself
again
Jesus
to the
disciples
at
the
sea
-
of Tiberias
He revealed [Himself]
now
in this way
They were
together
Simon
Peter
and
Thomas
-
called
Didymus
and
Nathanael
-
from
Cana
-
of Galilee
and
the [sons]
-
of Zebedee
and
others
of
the
disciples
His
two
Says
to them
Simon
Peter
I am going
to fish
They say
to him
Come
also
we
with
you
They went forth
and
went up
into
the
boat
and
during
that
-
night
they caught
nothing
Morning
now
already
having come
stood
Jesus
on
the
shore
not
however
knew
the
disciples
that
Jesus
it is
Says
therefore
to them
Jesus
Children
not
any
fish
have you
They answered
Him
No
-
And
He said
to them
Cast
to
the
right
side
of the
boat
the
net
and
you will find [some]
They cast
therefore
and
not
it
to haul in
were they able
from
the
multitude
of the
fish
Says
therefore
the
disciple
that
whom
loved
-
Jesus
-
to Peter
The
Lord
it is
Simon
therefore
Peter
having heard
that
the
Lord
it is
the
outer garment
put on
he was
for
naked
and
he cast
himself
into
the
sea
-
And
the other
disciples
in the
boat
came
not
for
were they
far
from
the
land
but
about
away
cubits
two hundred
dragging
the
net
with the
fish
When
therefore
they got out
onto
the
land
they see
a fire of coals
lying
and
fish
lying on [it]
and
bread
Says
to them
-
Jesus
Bring
[some] of
the
fish
that
you have caught
now
Went up
Simon
Peter
and
drew
the
net
to
the
land
full
of fish
large
a hundred
fifty
three
although
so many
there are
not
was torn
the
net
Says
to them
-
Jesus
Come
have breakfast
None
dared
of the
disciples
to ask
Him
You
who
are
knowing
that
the
Lord
it is
Comes
Jesus
and
takes
the
bread
and
gives [it]
to them
and
the
fish
likewise
This [is]
now
the third time
was revealed
Jesus
to the
disciples
having been raised
out from
[the] dead
When
therefore
they had dined
says
-
to Simon
Peter
-
Jesus
Simon
[son] of John
love you
Me
more
than these
He says
to Him
Yes
Lord
You
know
that
I dearly love
You
He says
to him
Feed
the
lambs
of Me
He says
to him
again
a second time
Simon
[son] of John
love you
Me
He says
to Him
Yes
Lord
You
know
that
I dearly love
You
He says
to him
Shepherd
the
sheep
of Me
He says
to him
the
third time
Simon
[son] of John
do you dearly love
Me
Was grieved
-
Peter
because
He said
to him
the
third time
Do you dearly love
Me
And
he said
to Him
Lord
all things
You
know
You
know
that
I dearly love
You
Says
to him
Jesus
Feed
the
sheep
of Me
Truly
truly
I say
to you
When
you were
younger
you dressed
yourself
and
walked
where
you desired
when
however
you shall be old
you will stretch forth
the
hands
of you
and
another
will dress
you
and
will bring [you]
where
not
you do desire
This
now
He said
signifying
by what
death
he will glorify
-
God
And
this
having said
He says
to him
Follow
Me
Having turned
-
Peter
sees
the
disciple
whom
loved
-
Jesus
following
who
also
had reclined
at
the
supper
on
the
bosom
of Him
and
said
Lord
who
is it
who
is betraying
You
Him
therefore
having seen
-
Peter
says
-
to Jesus
Lord
this man
and
what about
Says
to him
-
Jesus
If
him
I desire
to remain
until
I come
what [is it]
to
you
You
Me
follow
Went out
therefore
this
-
saying
among
the
brothers
that
the
disciple
that
not
dies
Not
said
however
to him
-
Jesus
that
not
he dies
but
If
him
I desire
to remain
until
I come
what [is it]
to
you
This
is
the
disciple
-
bearing witness
concerning
these things
and
the [one]
having written
these things
and
we know
that
true
of him
the
testimony
is
There are
now
also
other things
many
that
did
-
Jesus
which
if
they should be written
every
one
not even
itself
I suppose
the
world
to have space
for the
to be written
books
The
indeed
first
account
I composed
concerning
all the things
O
Theophilus
which
began
-
Jesus
to do
both
and
to teach
until
the
day
having given orders
to the
apostles
by
[the] Spirit
Holy
whom
He had chosen
He was taken up
to whom
also
He presented
Himself
alive
after
the
suffering
of Him
with
many
proofs
during
days
forty
being seen
by them
and
speaking
the things
concerning
the
kingdom
-
of God
And
being assembled together
He instructed
them
from
Jerusalem
not
to depart
but
to await
the
promise
of the
Father
That which
you heard
of Me
for
John
indeed
baptized
with water
you
however
with
[the] Spirit
will be baptized
Holy
not
after
many
these
days
Those
indeed
therefore
having come together
were asking
Him
saying
Lord
if
at
the
time
this
are you restoring
the
kingdom
-
to Israel
He said
to
them
Not
yours
it is
to know
times
or
seasons
which
the
Father
put in place
by
-
His own
authority
But
you will receive
power
having come
the
Holy
Spirit
upon
you
and
you will be
for Me
witnesses
in
both
Jerusalem
and
in
all
-
Judea
and
Samaria
and
to
[the] uttermost part
of the
earth
And
these things
having said
beholding
they
He was taken up
and
a cloud
hid
Him
from
the
eyes
of them
And
as
looking intently
they were
into
the
heaven
as was going
He
then
behold
men
two
stood by
them
in
apparel
white
who
also
said
Men
Galileans
why
do you stand
looking
into
-
heaven
This
-
Jesus
-
having been taken up
from
you
into
-
heaven
thus
will come
in that
manner
you beheld
Him
going
into
-
heaven
Then
they returned
to
Jerusalem
from
[the] mount
-
called
Olivet
which
is
near
Jerusalem
a Sabbath dayâs
holding
journey
And
when
they had entered
into
the
upper room
they went up
where
they were
staying
-
both
Peter
and
John
and
James
and
Andrew
Philip
and
Thomas
Bartholomew
and
Matthew
James [son]
of Alphaeus
and
Simon
the
Zealot
and
Judas [son]
of James
These
all
were
steadfastly continuing
with one accord
-
in prayer
with [the]
women
and
Mary
the
mother
-
of Jesus
and
with
the
brothers
of Him
And
in
the
days
these
having stood up
Peter
in
[the] midst
of the
brothers
he said
was
then
[the] number
of names
together
the
same
about
a hundred
twenty
Men
brothers
it was necessary for
to have been fulfilled
the
Scripture
which
spoke beforehand
the
Spirit
-
Holy
by
[the] mouth
of David
concerning
Judas
the [one]
having become
guide
to those
having arrested
Jesus
for
numbered
he was
with
us
and
was allotted
-
a share
of the
ministry
this
This [man]
indeed
then
acquired
a field
out of
[the] reward
-
of unrighteousness
and
headlong
having fallen
he burst open
in [the] middle
and
gushed out
all
the
intestines
of him
And
known
it became
to all
those
dwelling
in Jerusalem
so that
was called
the
field
that
in the
own
language
of them
Akeldama
that
is
Field
of Blood
It has been written
for
in [the]
book
of Psalms
Let become
the
homestead
of him
desolate
and
not
let there be
[one person]
dwelling
in
it
and
The
position
of him
let take
another
It behooves
therefore
the
having accompanied
us
men
during
all
[the] time
that
came in
and
went out
among
us
the
Lord
Jesus
having begun
from
the
baptism
of John
until
the
day
in which
He was taken up
from
us
a witness
of the
resurrection
of Him
with
us
to become
one
of these
And
they put forward
two
Joseph
-
called
Barsabbas
who
was called
Justus
and
Matthias
And
having prayed
they said
You
Lord
knower of the hearts
of all
show
which
You have chosen
of
these
-
two
one
to take
the
place
of the
ministry
this
and
apostleship
from
which
turned aside
Judas
to go
to
the
place
-
own
And
they gave
lots
for them
and
fell
the
lot
on
Matthias
and
he was numbered
with
the
eleven
apostles
And
during
the
arriving of
the
day
-
of Pentecost
they were
all
together
in
the
one [place]
And
came
suddenly
out of
-
heaven
a sound
like
[the] rushing
of a wind
violent
and
it filled
all
the
house
where
they were
sitting
And
there appeared
to them
dividing
tongues
as
of fire
and
sat
upon
one
each
of them
And
they were filled with
all
Spirit
Holy
and
began
to speak
in other
tongues
as
the
Spirit
was giving
to utter forth
to them
Were
now
in
Jerusalem
dwelling
Jews
men
devout
from
every
nation
of those
under
-
heaven
Having come about
now
the
sound
of this
came together
the
multitude
and
was confounded
because
was hearing
one
each
the
own
language
speaking
them
They were amazed
then
and
were marveling
saying
Not
behold
all
these
are
who
are speaking
Galileans
And
how
we
hear
each
the
own
language
of us
in
which
we were born
Parthians
and
Medes
and
Elamites
and
those
inhabiting
-
Mesopotamia
Judea
also
and
Cappadocia
Pontus
and
-
Asia
Phrygia
both
and
Pamphylia
Egypt
and
the
parts
-
of Libya
that
[are] around
Cyrene
and
those
visiting [here]
from Rome
Jews
both
and
converts
Cretans
and
Arabs
we hear
speaking
them
-
[in] our own
tongues
the
great things
-
of God
Were amazed
then
all
and
were perplexed
other
to
other
saying
What
wishes
this
to be
Others
however
mocking
were saying
-
Of new wine
full
they are
Having stood up
however
-
Peter
with
the
eleven
he lifted up
the
voice
of him
and
spoke forth
to them
Men
of Judea
and
those
inhabiting
Jerusalem
all
this
to you
known
let be
and
give heed to
the
words
of me
Not
for
as
you
suppose
these
are drunkards
it is
for
[the] hour
third
of the
day
but
this
is
that
having been spoken
by
the
prophet
Joel
And
it will be
in
the
last
days
says
-
God
I will pour out
of
the
Spirit
of Me
upon
all
flesh
and
will prophesy
the
sons
of you
and
the
daughters
of you
and
the
young men
of you
visions
will see
and
the
elders
of you
dreams
will dream
and even
upon
the
servants
of Me
and
upon
the
handmaidens
of Me
in
the
days
those
I will pour out
of
the
Spirit
of Me
and
they will prophesy
and
I will show
wonders
in
-
heaven
above
and
signs
on
the
earth
below
blood
and
fire
and
vapor
of smoke
The
sun
will be turned
into
darkness
and
the
moon
into
blood
before
coming
day
of [the] Lord
-
great
and
glorious
And
it shall be
everyone
who
if
they shall call upon
the
name
of [the] Lord
will be saved
Men
Israelites
hear
the
words
these
Jesus
of
Nazareth
a man
having been set forth
by
-
God
to
you
by miracles
and
wonders
and
signs
which
did
by
Him
-
God
in
the midst
of you
as
you yourselves
know
Him
by the
determinate
plan
and
foreknowledge
-
of God
delivered up
by
hands
lawless
having crucified
You put to death
whom
-
God
raised up
having loosed
the
agony
of
death
inasmuch as
not
it was
possible
[for] to be held
Him
by
it
David
for
says
about
Him
I foresaw
the
Lord
before
me
continually
everything
because
at [the]
right hand
of me
He is
that
not
I should be shaken
Because of
this
was glad
of me
the
heart
and
rejoiced
the
tongue
of me
and
now
also
the
flesh
of me
will dwell
in
hope
for
not
You will abandon
the
soul
of me
into
Hades
nor
will You allow
the
Holy One
of You
to see
decay
You have made known
to me
[the] paths
of life
You will fill
me
with joy
in
the
presence
of You
Men
brothers
it is permitted [me]
to speak
with
freedom
to
you
concerning
the
patriarch
David
that
both
he died
and
was buried
and
the
tomb
of him
is
among
us
unto
the
day
this
A prophet
therefore
being
and
knowing
that
with an oath
swore
to him
-
God
out of [the]
fruit
of the
loins
of him
to set
upon
the
throne
of him
Having foreseen
he spoke
concerning
the
resurrection
of the
Christ
that
neither
was He abandoned
into
Hades
nor
the
flesh
of Him
saw
decay
This
-
Jesus
has raised up
-
God
whereof
all
we
are
witnesses
To the
right hand
therefore
-
of God
having been exalted
-
and
the promise
of the
Spirit
-
Holy
having received
from
the
Father
He has poured out
this
which
you
both
are seeing
and
hearing
Not
for
David
ascended
into
the
heavens
he says
however
himself
Said
Lord
to
[the] Lord
of me
Sit
at
[the] right hand
of Me
until
-
I place
the
enemies
of You
a footstool
of the
feet
of You
Assuredly
therefore
let know
all
[the] house
of Israel
that
both
Lord
Him
and
Christ
has made
-
God
this
-
Jesus
whom
you
crucified
Having heard
then
they were pierced
to the
heart
they said
then
to
-
Peter
and
the
other
apostles
What
shall we do
men
brothers
Peter
then
to
them
Repent
and
be baptized
every one
of you
in
the
name
of Jesus
Christ
for the
forgiveness
of the
sins
of you
and
you will receive
the
gift
of the
Holy
Spirit
To you
for
is
the
promise
and
to the
children
of you
and
to all
those
at
a distance
as many as
-
shall call to Himself
[the] Lord
the
God
of us
Other
and
words
many
he earnestly testified
and
was exhorting
them
saying
Be saved
from
the
generation
-
perverse
this
Those
indeed
therefore
having received
the
word
of him
were baptized
and
were added
on
the
day
that
souls
about
three thousand
They were
now
steadfastly continuing
in the
teaching
of the
apostles
and
-
in fellowship
the
breaking
of the
bread
and
the
prayers
There was coming
then
upon every
soul
awe
many
and both
wonders
and
signs
through
the
apostles
were taking place
All
now
-
having believed
together
the
same
having
all things
in common
and
the
possessions
and
the
goods
they were selling
and
were dividing
them
to all
as
-
anyone
need
had
Every
day
and
steadfastly continuing
with one accord
in
the
temple
breaking
then
at each
house
bread
they were partaking
of food
with
gladness
and
sincerity
of heart
praising
-
God
and
having
favor
with
all
the
people
-
And
the Lord
kept adding
those who
were being saved
every
day
to
their
number
Peter
now
and
John
were going up
into
the
temple
at
the
hour
-
of prayer
the
ninth
And
a certain
man
lame
from
womb
of mother
of him
being
was being carried
whom
they placed
every
day
at
the
gate
of the
temple
-
called
Beautiful
-
to ask for
alms
from
those who
were going
into
the
temple
who
having seen
Peter
and
John
being about
to enter
into
the
temple
was asking
alms
to receive
Having looked intently
now
Peter
upon
him
with
-
John
he said
Look
unto
us
-
And
he began to give heed
to them
expecting
something
from
them
to receive
Said
however
Peter
Silver
and
gold
none
there is
to me
what
however
I have
this
to you
I give
In
the
name
of Jesus
Christ
of
Nazareth
walk
And
having taken
him
by the
right
hand
he raised up
him
immediately
then
were strengthened
the
feet
of him
and
the
ankles
And
leaping up
he stood
and
began walking
and
he entered
with
them
into
the
temple
walking
and
leaping
and
praising
-
God
And
saw
all
the
people
him
walking
and
praising
-
God
They recognized
then
him
that
he
was
the [one]
for
the
alms
sitting
at
the
Beautiful
Gate
of the
temple
and
they were filled
with wonder
and
amazement
at
that
having happened
to him
Is clinging
now
he
to
Peter
and
-
John
ran together
all
the
people
to
them
in
the
porch
-
called
Solomonâs
greatly amazed
Having seen [it]
however
-
Peter
answered
to
the
people
Men
Israelites
why
wonder you
at
this
Or
on us
why
you look intently
as if
by [our] own
power
or
godliness
[we] have made
-
to walk
him
The
God
of Abraham
and
of Isaac
and
Jacob
the
God
of the
fathers
of us
has glorified
the
servant
of Him
Jesus
whom
you
indeed
betrayed
and
disowned
in
[the] presence
of Pilate
having adjudged
that one
to release [Him]
You
however
the
Holy
and
Righteous One
denied
and
requested
a man
a murderer
to be granted
to you
-
and
the Author
-
of life
you killed
whom
-
God
has raised up
out from
[the] dead
whereof
we
witnesses
are
And
on
the
faith
in the
name
of Him
this [man]
whom
you see
and
know
has strengthened
the
name
of Him
and
the
faith
which [is]
through
Him
has given
to him
the
complete soundness
this
before
all
of you
And
now
brothers
I know
that
in
ignorance
you acted
as
also
the
rulers
of you
-
But
God
what
He foretold
by
[the] mouth
of all
the
prophets
[that] should suffer
the
Christ
of Him
He has fulfilled
thus
Repent
therefore
and
turn again
for
the
blotting out
of your
-
sins
so that
-
may come
times
of refreshing
from
[the] presence
of the
Lord
and
[that] He may send
the [One]
having been appointed
to you
Christ
Jesus
whom
it behooves
heaven
indeed
to receive
until
[the] times
of restoration
of all things
of which
spoke
-
God
by
[the] mouth
of
holy
from
[the] age
His
prophets
Moses
indeed
said
-
A prophet
to you
will raise up
[the] Lord
the
God
out from
the
brothers
of you
like
me
Him
You will listen to
in
all things
as many as
-
He might say
to
you
It will be [that]
now
every
soul
who
if
not
might heed
the
prophet
that
will be utterly destroyed
out from
the
people
And
all
now
the
prophets
from
Samuel
and
those
subsequently
as many as
have spoken
also
have announced
the
days
these
You
are
the
sons
of the
prophets
and
of the
covenant
that
-
God
made
with
the
fathers
of you
saying
to
Abraham
And
in
the
seed
of you
will be blessed
all
the
families
of the
earth
To you
first
having raised up
-
God
the
servant
of Him
sent
Him
blessing
you
in
-
turning away
each
from
the
wickednesses
of you
Speaking
now
of them
to
the
people
came
upon them
the
priests
and
the
captain
of the
temple
and
the
Sadducees
being distressed
because of
-
teaching
their
the
people
and
proclaiming
in
-
Jesus
the
resurrection
-
out from
[the] dead
and
they laid
on them
the
hands
and
put [them]
in
custody
until
the
next day
it was
for
evening
already
Many
however
of those
having heard
the
word
believed
and
became
number
of the
men
about
thousand
five
It came to pass
then
on
the
next day
were gathered together
their
-
rulers
and
-
elders
and
-
scribes
in
Jerusalem
and
Annas
the
high priest
and
Caiaphas
and
John
and
Alexander
and
as many as
were
of
descent
high-priestly
And
having placed
them
in
the
midst
they began to inquire
In
what
power
or
in
what
name
did
this
you
Then
Peter
having been filled
with [the] Spirit
Holy
said
to
them
Rulers
of the
people
and
elders
if
we
this day
are being examined
as to
a good work
[to the] man
ailing
by
what [means]
he
has been healed
known
let it be
to all
you
and
to all
the
people
of Israel
that
in
the
name
of Jesus
Christ
of
Nazareth
whom
you
crucified
whom
-
God
raised
out from
[the] dead
in
Him
this [man]
stands
before
you
sound
This
is
the
stone
-
having been rejected
by
you
the
builders
which
has become
into
head
of [the] corner
And
not
there is
in
other
no one
the
salvation
not
for
name
is there
another
under
-
heaven
-
having been given
among
men
by
which
it behooves
to be saved
us
Seeing
now
the
-
of Peter
boldness
and
of John
and
having understood
that
men
unschooled
they are
and
ordinary
they were astonished
They recognized
then
them
that
with
-
Jesus
they had been
-
And
the man
beholding
with
them
standing
-
having been healed
nothing
they had
to contradict
Having commanded
however
them
outside
the
Council
to go
they began to confer
with
one another
saying
What
shall we do
to the
men
these
That
truly
for
a noteworthy
sign
has come to pass
through
them
to all
those
inhabiting
Jerusalem
[is] evident
and
not
we are able
to deny [it]
But
that
not
on
further
it might spread
among
the
people
let us warn
them
no longer
to speak
in
the
name
this
to no
man
And
having called
them
they commanded [them]
at all
not
to speak
nor
to teach
in
the
name
-
of Jesus
-
But
Peter
and
John
answering
said
to
them
Whether
right
it is
before
-
God
to you
to listen
rather
than
-
God
you must judge
not
are able
for
we
what
we have seen
and
heard
not
to speak
-
And
having further threatened [them]
they let go
them
nothing
finding
the
how
they might punish
them
on account of
the
people
because
all
were glorifying
-
God
for
that
having happened
years [old]
for
was
more than
forty
the
man
on
whom
had taken place
the
sign
this
of
healing
Having been let go
now
they came
to
the
own
and
reported
how much
to
them
the
chief priests
and
the
elders
had said
-
And
having heard
with one accord
they lifted up
[their] voice
to
-
God
and
said
Sovereign Lord
You
-
made
the
heaven
and
the
earth
and
the
sea
and
all
that [is]
in
them
-
of the
father
of us
by
[the] Spirit
Holy
through [the] mouth
David
servant
of You
having spoken
-
Why
did rage
[the] Gentiles
and
peoples
did devise
vain things
Took [their] stand
the
kings
of the
earth
and
the
rulers
were gathered
together
-
themselves
against
the
Lord
and
against
the
Christ
of Him
Were gathered together
for
in
truth
in
the
city
this
against
the
holy
servant
of You
Jesus
whom
You anointed
Herod
both
and
Pontius
Pilate
with
[the] Gentiles
and
peoples
of Israel
to do
whatever
the
hand
of You
and
the
purpose
had determined beforehand
to happen
And
-
now
Lord
look
upon
the
threats
of them
and
grant
to the
servants
of You
with
boldness
all
to speak
the
word
of You
in
that
the
hand
stretch out
You
for
healing
and
signs
and
wonders
to take place
through
the
name
of the
holy
servant
of You
Jesus
And
having prayed
they
was shaken
the
place
in
which
they were
assembled
and
they were filled with
all
the
Holy
Spirit
and
were speaking
the
word
-
of God
with
boldness
-
And
the multitude
-
having believed
were [in]
heart
and
soul
one
and
not
one
anything
of that which
possessed
he
claimed
his own
to be
but
were
to them
all things
in common
And
[with] power
great
were giving
-
testimony
the
apostles
of the
Lord
Jesus
of the
resurrection
grace
then
abundant
was
upon
all
them
Not even
for
in need
anyone
there was
among
them
as many as
for
owners
of lands
or
houses
were
selling [them]
were bringing
the
proceeds
of what
is sold
and
were laying [them]
at
the
feet
of the
apostles
distribution was made
then
to each
just as
-
anyone
need
had
Joseph
now
-
having been called
Barnabas
by
the
apostles
which
is
translated
Son
of encouragement
a Levite
a Cypriot
at the
birth
owns
by him
a field
having sold [it]
brought
the
money
and
laid [it]
at
the
feet
of the
apostles
A man
now
certain
Ananias
named
with
Sapphira
the
wife
of him
sold
a property
and
he kept back
from
the
proceeds
being aware of [it]
also
the
wife
and
having brought
a portion
certain
at
the
feet
of the
apostles
he laid [it]
Said
however
-
Peter
Ananias
because of
why
has filled
-
Satan
the
heart
of you
to lie to
[for] you
the
Spirit
-
Holy
and
to keep back
from
the
proceeds
of the
land
Not
remaining
to you
did it remain
And
having been sold
in
the
own
authority
it was
Why
-
did you purpose
in
the
heart
of you
the
deed
this
Not
you have lied
to men
but
-
to God
Hearing
now
-
Ananias
the
words
these
having fallen down
he breathed his last
And
came
fear
great
upon
all
those
hearing
Having arisen
then
the
younger [men]
covered
him
and
having carried [him] out
buried [him]
It came to pass
now
about
hours
three
afterward
also
the
wife
of him
not
knowing
that
having come to pass
came in
Replied
then
to
her
Peter
Tell
me
if
for so much
the
land
you sold
-
And
she said
Yes
for so much
-
But
Peter [said]
to
her
Why [is it]
that
have agreed together
you
to test
the
Spirit
of [the] Lord
Behold
the
feet
of those
having buried
the
husband
of you
[are] at
the
door
and
they will carry out
you
She fell down
then
immediately
at
the
feet
of him
and
breathed her last
Having come in
then
the
young [men]
found
her
dead
and
having carried out
they buried [her]
by
the
husband
of her
And
came
fear
great
upon
all
the
church
and
upon
all
those
hearing
these things
By
now
the
hands
of the
apostles
were happening
signs
and
wonders
many
among
the
people
And
they were
with one accord
all
in
the
Colonnade
of Solomon
of the
now
rest
no one
dared
to join
them
but
were magnifying
them
the
people
more
now
were added
believing
in the
Lord
multitudes
of men
both
and
women
so as
even
into
the
streets
to bring out
the
sick
and
to put [them]
on
cots
and
mats
that
coming
of Peter
at least
the
shadow
might envelop
some
of them
Were coming together
now
also
the
multitude
from the
surrounding
cities
Jerusalem
bringing
[the] sick
and
[those] being tormented
by
spirits
unclean
who
were healed
all
Having risen up
however
the
high priest
and
all
those
with
him
-
being
the sect
of the
Sadducees
were filled
with jealousy
and
they laid
the
hands
on
the
apostles
and
put
them
in
[the] jail
public
An angel
however
of [the] Lord
during
the night
having opened
the
doors
of the
prison
having brought out
then
them
said
Go
and
having stood
speak
in
the
temple
to the
people
all
the
words
of the
life
this
Having heard
now
they entered
at
the
dawn
into
the
temple
and
were teaching
Having come
now
the
high priest
and
those
with
him
they called together
the
Council
even
all
the
Senate
of the
sons
of Israel
and
sent
to
the
prison house
to bring
them
-
And
having come
[the] officers
not
did find
them
in
the
prison
having returned
then
they reported back
saying
-
The
prison house
we found
shut
with
all
security
and
the
guards
standing
before
the
doors
having opened [them]
however
inside
no one
we found
When
now
they heard
the
words
these
-
both
the captain
of the
temple
and
the
chief priests
were perplexed
concerning
them
what
-
might be
this
Having come
then
a certain one
reported
to them
-
Behold
the
men
whom
you put
in
the
prison
are
in
the
temple
standing
and
teaching
the
people
Then
having gone
the
captain
with
the
officers
was bringing
them
not
with
force
they were afraid of
for
the
people
lest
they might be stoned
Having brought
then
them
they set [them]
in
the
Council
And
asked
them
the
high priest
saying
by a charge
we commanded
you
not
to teach
in
the
name
this
And
behold
you have filled
-
Jerusalem
with the
teaching
of you
and
you intend
to bring
upon
us
the
blood
of the
man
this
Answering
however
Peter
and
the
apostles
said
To obey
it is necessary
God
rather
than
men
The
God
of the
fathers
of us
raised up
Jesus
whom
you
killed
having hanged [Him]
on
a tree
Him
-
God
[as] Prince
and
Savior
exalted
by the
right hand
of Him
-
to give
repentance
-
to Israel
and
forgiveness
of sins
And
we
are
witnesses
of the
things
these
and also
the
Spirit
-
Holy
whom
has given
-
God
to those
obeying
Him
-
And
having heard
they were cut [to the heart]
and
were desiring
to put to death
them
Having risen up
however
a certain [man]
in
the
Council
a Pharisee
named
Gamaliel
a teacher of the law
honored
by all
the
people
he commanded [them]
outside
for a short while
the
men
to put
He said
then
to
them
Men
Israelites
take heed
to yourselves
with
the
men
these
what
you are about
to do
Before
for
these
-
days
rose up
Theudas
affirming
to be
somebody
himself
to whom
were joined
of men
number
about
four hundred
who
was put to death
and
all
as many as
were persuaded
by him
were dispersed
and
it came
to
nothing
After
this man
rose up
Judas
the
Galilean
in
the
days
of the
registration
and
drew away
people
after
him
And he
perished
and
all
as many as
were persuaded
by him
were scattered
And
-
now
I say
to you
withdraw
from
the
men
these
and
let alone
them
for
if
be
from
men
the
plan
this
or
the
work
this
it will be overthrown
if
however
from
God
it is
not
you will be able
to overthrow
them
lest
ever
also
fighting against God
You would be found
They were persuaded
now
by him
and
having called in
the
apostles
having beaten
they commanded [them]
not
to speak
in
the
name
-
of Jesus
and
released [them]
They
indeed
therefore
departed
rejoicing
from
[the] presence
of the
Council
that
they had been counted worthy
for
the
Name
to suffer dishonor
Every
then
day
in
the
temple
and
in
house
not
they ceased
teaching
and
proclaiming the good news that
the
Christ
[is] Jesus
In
now
the
days
these
[as] are multiplying
the
disciples
there arose
a grumbling
of the
Hellenists
against
the
Hebrews
because
were being overlooked
in
the
distribution
-
daily
the
widows
of them
Having called near
then
the
Twelve
the
multitude
of the
disciples
they said
Not
desirable
it is [for]
us
having neglected
the
word
-
of God
to attend
tables
Select
therefore
brothers
men
out from
yourselves
being well attested
seven
full
of [the] Spirit
and
wisdom
whom
we will appoint
over
the
task
this
We
now
in the
prayer
and
the
ministry
of the
word
will steadfastly continue
And
was pleasing
the
statement
before
all
the
multitude
and
they chose
Stephen
a man
full
of faith
and
[of the] Spirit
holy
and
Philip
and
Prochorus
and
Nicanor
and
Timon
and
Parmenas
and
Nicolas
a convert
of Antioch
whom
they set
before
the
apostles
and
having prayed
they laid
on them
the
hands
And
the
word
-
of God
continued to increase
and
was multiplied
the
number
of the
disciples
in
Jerusalem
exceedingly
a great
then
multitude
of the
priests
were becoming obedient
to the
faith
Stephen
now
full
grace
and
power
was performing
wonders
and
signs
great
among
the
people
Arose
however
certain
of those
from
the
synagogue
-
called
Freedmen
including
Cyrenians
and
Alexandrians
and
of those
from
Cilicia
and
Asia
disputing
with
Stephen
And
not
they were able
to withstand
the
wisdom
and
the
Spirit
by whom
he was speaking
Then
they suborned
men
saying
-
We have heard
him
speaking
words
blasphemous
against
Moses
and
-
God
They stirred up
then
the
people
and
the
elders
and
the
scribes
and
having come upon [him]
they seized
him
and
brought [him]
to
the
Council
They set
also
witnesses
false
saying
The
man
this
not
does stop
speaking
words
against
the
place
-
holy
and
the
law
we have heard
for
him
saying
that
Jesus
of
Nazareth
this
will destroy
the
place
this
and
will change
the
customs
that
delivered
to us
Moses
And
having looked intently
on
him
all
-
sitting
in
the
Council
saw
the
face
of him
as
[the] face
of an angel
Said
then
the
high priest
If
these things
so
are
-
And
he began to speak
Men
brothers
and
fathers
listen
The
God
-
of glory
appeared
to the
father
of us
Abraham
being
in
-
Mesopotamia
before
rather
dwelling
his
in
Haran
and
He said
to
him
Go out
from
the
country
of you
and
the
kindred
of you
and
come
into
the
land
which
-
to you
I will show
Then
having gone out
from
[the] land
of Chaldeans
he dwelt
in
Haran
And from there
after
-
died
the
father
of him
He removed
him
into
the
land
this
in
which
you
now
dwell
And
not
He did give
to him
an inheritance
in
it
not even
[the] length
of a foot
but
He promised
to give
to him
for
a possession
it
and
to the
descendants
of him
after
him
not
there being
to him
a child
Spoke
however
thus
-
God
that
will be
the
seed
of him
a sojourner
in
a land
strange
and
they will enslave
it
and
will mistreat [it]
years
four hundred
And
the
nation
to which
if
they will be in bondage
will judge
I
-
God
said
and
after
these things
they will come forth
and
will serve
Me
in
the
place
this
And
He gave
to him
[the] covenant
of circumcision
and
thus
he begat
-
Isaac
and
circumcised
him
on the
day
-
eighth
and
Isaac
-
Jacob
and
Jacob
the
twelve
patriarchs
And
the
patriarchs
having envied
-
Joseph
sold [him]
into
Egypt
But
was
-
God
with
him
and
rescued
him
out of
all
the
tribulations
of him
and
gave
him
favor
and
wisdom
before
Pharaoh
king
of Egypt
and
he appointed
him
ruler
over
Egypt
and
all
the
house
of him
Came
then
a famine
upon
all
-
of Egypt
and
Canaan
and
affliction
great
and
not
were finding
sustenance
the
fathers
of us
Having heard
now
Jacob
[there] is
grain
in
Egypt
he sent forth
the
fathers
of us
first
and
on
the
second time
was made known
Joseph
to
brothers
of him
and
known
became
-
to Pharaoh
the
family
of Joseph
Having sent
then
Joseph
he called for
Jacob
the
father
of him
and
all
the
kindred
in all
souls
seventy
five
And
went down
Jacob
into
Egypt
and
died
he
and
the
fathers
of us
and
they were carried over
into
Shechem
and
were placed
in
the
tomb
which
had bought
Abraham
for a sum
of silver
from
the
sons
of Hamor
in
Shechem
As
now
was drawing near
the
time
of the
promise
that
had made
-
God
-
to Abraham
increased
the
people
and
multiplied
in
Egypt
until
that
there arose
king
another
over
Egypt
who
not
knew
-
Joseph
He
having dealt treacherously with
the
race
of us
he mistreated
the
fathers
-
making [them]
the
infants
abandon
of them
unto
the
not
they would live
In
that
time
was born
Moses
and
he was
beautiful
-
to God
who
was brought up
months
three
in
the
house
of the
father
Having been set outside
then
he
took up
him
the
daughter
of Pharaoh
and
brought up
him
for herself
for
a son
And
was instructed
Moses
all
[the] wisdom
of [the] Egyptians
he was
now
mighty
in
words
and
deeds
of him
When
then
was fulfilled
to him
of forty years
a period
it came
into
the
mind
of him
to visit
the
brothers
of him
the
sons
of Israel
And
having seen
a certain one
being wronged
he defended [him]
and
did
vengeance
for the [one]
being oppressed
having struck down
the
Egyptian
He was supposing
now
to understand
the
brothers
that
-
God
by
[the] hand
of him
is giving
salvation
them
-
but
not
they understood
On the
and
following
day
he appeared
to those who
were quarreling
and
urged
them
to
peace
having said
Men
brothers
you are
So that
why
wrong you
one another
The [one]
however
mistreating
the
neighbor
pushed away
him
having said
Who
you
appointed
ruler
and
judge
over
us
Not
to kill
me
you
desire
the same
way
you put to death
yesterday
the
Egyptian
Fled
then
Moses
at
the
remark
this
and
became
exiled
in
[the] land
of Midian
where
he begat
sons
two
And
having been passed
years
forty
appeared
to him
in
the
wilderness
of the
Mount
Sinai
an angel
in
a flame
of fire
of a bush
-
And
Moses
having seen [it]
marveled at
the
vision
coming near
then
of him
to behold [it]
there was
[the] voice
of [the] Lord
I [am]
the
God
of the
Fathers
of you
the
God
of Abraham
and
of Isaac
and
of Jacob
Terrified
then
having become
Moses
not
he dared
to look
Said
then
to him
the
Lord
Take off
the
sandal
of the
feet
of you
-
for
the place
on
which
you stand
ground
holy
is
Having seen
I saw
the
oppression
of the
people
of Me
-
in
Egypt
and
the
groans
of them
I have heard
and
I have come down
to deliver
them
and
now
come
I will send
you
to
Egypt
This
-
Moses
whom
they rejected
having said
Who
you
appointed
ruler
and
judge
him
whom
God [as]
and
ruler
and
redeemer
sent
by
[the] hand
of [the] angel
-
having appeared
to him
in
the
bush
this one
led out
them
having done
wonders
and
signs
in
[the] land
of Egypt
and
in
[the] Red
Sea
and
in
the
wilderness
years
forty
This
is
the
Moses
-
having said
to the
sons
of Israel
A prophet
for you
will raise up
-
God
out from
the
brothers
of you
like
me
This
is
the [one]
having been
in
the
congregation
in
the
wilderness
with
the
angel
-
speaking
to him
in
the
Mount
Sinai
and
of the
fathers
of us
who
received
oracles
living
to give
to us
to whom
not
were willing
obedient
to be
the
fathers
of us
but
thrust away
and
turned back
in
the
hearts
of them
to
Egypt
having said
-
to Aaron
Make
us
gods
who
will go before
us
-
As for
Moses
this
who
brought out
us
from
[the] land
of Egypt
not
we know
what
has happened
to him
And
they made a calf
in
the
days
those
and
offered
a sacrifice
to the
idol
and
they were rejoicing
in
the
works
of the
hands
of them
Turned away
however
-
God
and
delivered
them
to worship
the
host
of
heaven
as
it has been written
in [the]
book
of the
prophets
Not
slain beasts
and
sacrifices
did you offer
to Me
years
forty
in
the
wilderness
O house
of Israel
And
You took up
the
tabernacle
-
of Moloch
and
the
star
of the
god
Rephan
the
images
that
you made
to worship
them
and
I will remove
you
beyond
Babylon
The
tabernacle
of the
testimony
was
with
fathers
of us
in
the
wilderness
just as
had commanded
the [One]
speaking
-
to Moses
to make
it
according to
the
pattern
that
he had seen
which
also
brought [it]
having received by succession
the
fathers
of us
with
Joshua
in
the
taking possession
of the
nations
whom
drove out
-
God
from [the]
face
of the
fathers
of us
until
the
days
of David
who
found
favor
before
-
God
and
asked
to find
a dwelling place
for the
God
of Jacob
Solomon
however
built
Him
[the] house
Yet
not
the
Most High
in
hand-made [houses]
dwells
As
the
prophet
says
-
Heaven [is]
to Me
a throne
-
and
the earth
a footstool
of the
feet
of Me
What kind of
house
will you build
Me
says
[the] Lord
or
what [is]
[the] place
of the
rest
of Me
Not
the
hand
of Me
has made
these things
all
Stiff-necked
and
uncircumcised
in heart
and
-
ears
you
always
the
Spirit
-
Holy
resist
as
the
fathers
of you
also
you
Which
of the
prophets
not
did persecute
the
fathers
of you
And
they killed
those
having foretold
about
the
coming
of the
Righteous One
of whom
now
you
betrayers
and
murderers
have become
who
received
the
law
by
[the] ordination
of angels
and
not
have kept [it]
Hearing
now
these things
they were cut
in the
hearts
of them
and
began gnashing
the
teeth
at
him
He being
however
full
of [the] Spirit
Holy
having looked intently
into
-
heaven
saw
[the] glory
of God
and
Jesus
standing
at
the right hand
-
of God
and
he said
Behold
I see
the
heavens
having been opened
and
the
Son
-
of Man
at
the right [hand]
standing
-
of God
Having cried out
then
in a voice
loud
they held
the
ears
of them
and
rushed
with one accord
upon
him
and
having cast [him]
out of
the
city
they began to stone [him]
And
the
witnesses
laid aside
the
garments
of them
at
the
feet
of a young man
named
Saul
And [as]
they were stoning
-
Stephen
he was calling out
and
saying
Lord
Jesus
receive
the
spirit
of me
Having fallen
then
on [his]
knees
he cried
in a voice
loud
Lord
not
place
to them
this
-
sin
And
this
having said
he fell asleep
Saul
now
was there
consenting
to the
killing
of him
Arose
then
on
that
-
day
a persecution
great
against
the
church
which [was]
in
Jerusalem
All
then
were scattered
throughout
the
regions
-
of Judea
and
Samaria
except
the
apostles
Buried
now
-
Stephen
men
devout
and
made
lamentation
great
over
him
Saul
however
was destroying
the
church
[houses] after
-
houses
entering
dragging off
then
men
and
women
he was delivering [them]
to
prison
Those
indeed
therefore
having been scattered
went about
preaching
the
word
Philip
now
having gone down
to
-
[a] city
-
of Samaria
was proclaiming
to them
the
Christ
Were giving heed
now
the
crowds
to the things
being spoken
by
-
Philip
with one accord
in
the [time]
to hear
them
and
to see
the
signs
that
he was performing
Many
for
of those
having
spirits
unclean
crying
voice
in a loud
they were coming out [of them]
many
now
having been paralyzed
and
lame
were healed
There was
then
great
joy
in
the
city
that
A man
now
certain
named
Simon
had been formerly
in
the
city
practicing sorcery
and
amazing
the
people
-
of Samaria
declaring
to be
someone
himself
great
to whom
were giving heed
all
from
small
to
great
saying
This one
is
the
power
-
of God
that
[is] called
Great
They were giving heed
now
to him
because
the
long
time
with the
magic arts
he had amazed
them
When
however
they believed
-
Philip
proclaiming the gospel
concerning
the
kingdom
-
of God
and
the
name
of Jesus
Christ
they were baptized
men
both
and
women
-
And
Simon
also
himself
believed
and
having been baptized
was
steadfastly continuing
-
with Philip
Beholding
then
[the] signs
and
miracles
great
being performed
he was amazed
Having heard
now
the
in
Jerusalem
apostles
that
had received
-
Samaria
the
word
-
of God
they sent
to
them
Peter
and
John
who
having come down
prayed
for
them
that
they might receive [the]
Spirit
Holy
Not yet
for
He was
upon
any
of them
fallen
only
however
baptized
they had been
into
the
name
of the
Lord
Jesus
Then
they began laying
the
hands
upon
them
and
they received
[the] Spirit
Holy
Having seen
now
-
of Simon
that
through
the
laying on
of the
hands
of the
apostles
was given
the
Spirit
he offered
to them
money
saying
Give
also to me
the
authority
this
that
on whom
if
I may lay
the
hands
he may receive
[the] Spirit
Holy
Peter
however
said
to
him
The
silver
of you
with
you
may it be
to
destruction
because
the
gift
-
of God
you thought
by
money
to be obtained
No
there is
to you
part
nor
lot
in
the
matter
this
the
for
heart
of you
not
is
right
before
-
God
Repent
therefore
of
the
wickedness
of yours
this
and
pray earnestly to
the
Lord
if
indeed
will be forgiven
you
the
intent
of the
heart
of you
in
for
[the] gall
of bitterness
and
[the] bond
of iniquity
I see
you
being
Answering
now
-
Simon
said
Pray earnestly
you
on behalf
of me
to
the
Lord
so that
nothing
may come
upon
me
of which
you have spoken
They
indeed
therefore
having earnestly testified
and
having spoken
the
word
of the
Lord
traveled back
to
Jerusalem
to many
then
villages
of the
Samaritans
they were preaching the gospel
An angel
now
of [the] Lord
spoke
to
Philip
saying
Rise up
and
go
toward
[the] south
to
the
road
-
going down
from
Jerusalem
to
Gaza
This
is
[the] desert [road]
And
having risen up
he went
And
behold
a man
an Ethiopian
a eunuch
a potentate
of Candace
queen
of [the] Ethiopians
who
was
over
all
the
treasure
of her
who
had come
to worship
to
Jerusalem
he was
then
returning
and
sitting
in
the
chariot
of him
and
he was reading
the
prophet
Isaiah
Said
then
the
Spirit
-
to Philip
Go near
and
join yourself
to the
chariot
this
Having run up
then
-
Philip
heard
him
reading
Isaiah
the
prophet
and
said
Then
also
understand you
what
you are reading
-
And
he said
How
for
-
could I be able
if
not
someone
will guide
me
He invited
then
-
Philip
having come up
to sit
with
him
-
Now
the passage
of the
Scripture
which
he was reading
was
this
As
a sheep
to
slaughter
He was led
and
as
a lamb
before
the [one]
shearing
him
[is] silent
so
not
He opens
the
mouth
of Him
In
the
humiliation
-
justice
from Him
was taken away
The
generation
of Him
who
will describe
For
is removed
from
the
earth
the
life
of Him
Answering
now
the
eunuch
-
to Philip
said
I pray
you
concerning
whom
the
prophet
says
this
Concerning
himself
or
concerning
other
some
Having opened
then
-
Philip
the
mouth
of him
and
having begun
from
the
Scripture
this
he proclaimed the good news
to him
-
Jesus
As
then
they were going
along
the
road
they came
upon
some
water
and
says
the
eunuch
Behold
water
what
prevents
me
to be baptized
And
he commanded
to stop
the
chariot
And
they went down
both
to
the
water
-
both
Philip
and
the
eunuch
and
he baptized
him
When
now
they came up
out of
the
water
[the] Spirit
of [the] Lord
carried away
-
Philip
and
not
saw
him
no longer
the
eunuch
he went
for
the
way
of him
rejoicing
Philip
however
was found
at
Azotus
and
passing through
he was proclaiming the gospel
to the
towns
all
until
-
coming
his
to
Caesarea
-
But
Saul
still
breathing out
threats
and
murder
toward
the
disciples
of the
Lord
having gone
to the
high priest
requested
from
him
letters
in
Damascus
to
the
synagogues
so that
if
any
he found
of the
way
being
men
both
and
women
having bound
he might bring [them]
to
Jerusalem
In
now
-
proceeding
it came to pass
[as] he
draws near
-
to Damascus
suddenly
also
him
flashed around
a light
from
-
heaven
And
having fallen
on
the
ground
he heard
a voice
saying
to him
Saul
Saul
why
Me
do you persecute
He said
then
Who
are You
Lord
-
And [He said]
I
am
Jesus
whom
you
are persecuting
But
rise up
and
enter
into
the
city
and
it will be told
you
that
what
you
it behooves
to do
-
And
the men
-
traveling with
him
stood
speechless
hearing
indeed
the
voice
no one
however
seeing
Rose up
then
Saul
from
the
ground
having been opened
however
the
eyes
of him
nothing
he could see
Leading by the hand
then
him
they brought [him]
to
Damascus
And
he was
days
three
without
seeing
and
neither
did he eat
nor
drink
There was
now
a certain
disciple
in
Damascus
named
Ananias
And
said
to
him
in
a vision
the
Lord
Ananias
-
And
he said
Behold
me
Lord
-
And
the Lord
to
him [said]
Having risen up
go
into
the
street
-
called
Straight
and
seek
in
[the] house
of Judas
Saul
named
of Tarsus
Behold
for
he is praying
and
he saw
a man
Ananias
named
having come
and
having put
on him
hands
so that
he might see again
Answered
but
Ananias
Lord
I have heard
from
many
concerning
the
man
this
how many
evils
to
saints
of You
he did
in
Jerusalem
and
here
he has
authority
from
the
chief priests
to bind
all
those
calling on
the
name
of You
Said
however
to
him
the
Lord
Go
for
a vessel
of choice
is
to Me
this [man]
-
to carry
the
name
of Me
before
Gentiles
and
also
kings
[the] sons
then
of Israel
I
for
will show
to him
how much
it behooves
him
for
the
name
of Me
to suffer
Went away
then
Ananias
and
entered
into
the
house
and
having laid
upon
him
the
hands
he said
Saul
Brother
the
Lord
has sent
me
Jesus
the [One]
having appeared
to you
on
the
road
by which
you were coming
that
you may see again
and
be filled
[of the] Spirit
Holy
And
immediately
fell
of him
from
the
eyes
[something] like
scales
he regained his sight
also
And
having risen up
he was baptized
and
having taken
food
he was strengthened
He was
now
with
the
in
Damascus
disciples
days
some
And
immediately
in
the
synagogues
he began proclaiming
-
Jesus
that
He
is
the
Son
-
of God
Were amazed
then
all
-
hearing
and
were saying
Not
this
is
the [one]
having ravaged
in
Jerusalem
those
calling on
the
name
this
And
here
for
this
he had come
that
having been bound
them
he might bring
to
the
chief priests
Saul
however
all the more
was empowered
and
kept confounding
Jews
-
dwelling
in
Damascus
proving
that
this
is
the
Christ
When
now
had passed
days
many
plotted together
the
Jews
to kill
him
became known
however
-
to Saul
the
plot
of them
They were closely watching
now
also
the
gates
day
and
also
night
so that
him
they might kill
having taken [him]
however
the
disciples
of him
by night
through
the
wall
they let down
him
having lowered [him]
in
a basket
Having arrived
then
in
Jerusalem
he was attempting
to join
the
disciples
And
all
were afraid of
him
not
believing
that
he is
a disciple
Barnabas
however
having taken
him
brought [him]
to
the
apostles
and
he related
to them
how
on
the
road
he had seen
the
Lord
and
that
He had spoken
to him
and
how
in
Damascus
he had spoken boldly
in
the
name
of Jesus
And
he was
with
them
coming in
and
going out
in
Jerusalem
speaking boldly
in
the
name
of
Lord
He was speaking
also
and
was debating
with
the
Hellenists
-
but
they were seeking
to kill
him
Having known [it]
however
the
brothers
brought down
him
to
Caesarea
and
sent away
him
to
Tarsus
The
indeed
then
church
throughout
all
-
of Judea
and
Galilee
and
Samaria
had
peace
being edified
and
going on
in the
fear
of the
Lord
and
in the
comfort
of the
Holy
Spirit
they were multiplied
It came to pass that
now
Peter
passing
through
all [quarters]
went down
also
to
the
saints
-
inhabiting
Lydda
He found
then
there
a man
certain
named
Aeneas
for
years
eight
lying
on
a bed
who
was
paralyzed
And
said
to him
-
Peter
Aeneas
heals
you
Jesus
Christ
rise up
and
make the bed
for yourself
And
immediately
he rose up
And
saw
him
all
those
inhabiting
Lydda
and
-
Sharon
who
turned
to
the
Lord
In
Joppa
now
certain
there was
a disciple
named
Tabitha
which
translated
is called
Dorcas
She
was
full of
works
good
and
of alms
that
she continually did
It came to pass
however
in
the
days
those
[that] having become sick
she
died
Having washed [her]
then
put [her]
in
an upper room
Near
now
being
Lydda
-
Joppa
the
disciples
having heard
that
Peter
is
in
it
sent
two
men
to
him
imploring
Not
to delay
coming
to
us
Having risen up
then
Peter
went with
them
who
having arrived
brought [him]
into
the
upper room
And
stood by
him
all
the
widows
weeping
and
showing
[the] tunics
and
garments
that
had made
with
them
being
-
Dorcas
Having put
then
outside
all
-
Peter
and
having bowed
the
knees
he prayed
And
having turned
to
the
body
he said
Tabitha
arise
-
And
she opened
the
eyes
of her
and
having seen
-
Peter
she sat up
Having given
then
her
[his] hand
he raised up
her
Having called
then
the
saints
and
the
widows
he presented
her
living
Known
then
it became
throughout
all
-
of Joppa
and
believed
many
on
the
Lord
It came to pass
then
days
many
he stayed
in
Joppa
with
a certain
Simon
a tanner
A man
now
certain
in
Caesarea
named
Cornelius
[was] a centurion
of
[the] Cohort
that
is called
Italian
devout
and
fearing
-
God
with
all
the
household
of him
doing
alms
many
to the
people
and
praying
to
God
continually
all
He saw
in
a vision
clearly
as if
about
hour
the ninth
of the
day
an angel
-
of God
having come
to
him
and
having said
to him
Cornelius
-
And
having looked intently
on him
and
afraid
having become
he said
What
is it
Lord
He said
then
to him
The
prayers
of You
and
the
alms
of you
have ascended
as
a memorial
before
-
God
And
now
send
men
to
Joppa
and
summon
Simon
a man
who
is called
Peter
He
lodges
with
a certain
Simon
a tanner
whose
is
[the] house
by
[the] sea
When
then
had departed
the
angel
-
speaking
to him
having called
two
of the
servants
and
a soldier
devout
of those who
are attending
him
and
having related
all things
to them
he sent
them
to
-
Joppa
On the
now
next day
as are journeying
these
and
the
city
approaching
went up
Peter
on
the
housetop
to pray
about
hour
the sixth
He became
then
hungry
and
desired
to eat
[as] were preparing
however
they
fell
upon
him
a trance
and
he beholds
-
heaven
opening
and
descending
a vessel
certain
as
a sheet
great
by four
corners
being let down
upon
the
earth
in
which
were
all
the
quadrupeds
and
creeping things
of the
earth
and
birds
of
heaven
And
came
a voice
to
him
Having risen up
Peter
kill
and
eat
-
And
Peter
said
In no way
Lord
for
never
have I eaten
anything
common
or
unclean
And
a voice
[came] again
for
the second time
to
him
What
-
God
has cleansed
you
not
call common
This
now
took place
for
three times
and
immediately
was taken up
the
vessel
into
-
heaven
While
then
in
himself
was perplexed
-
Peter
what
-
might be
the
vision
that
he had seen
behold
the
men
-
having been sent
from
-
Cornelius
having inquired for
the
house
-
of Simon
stood
at
the
gate
And
having called out
they were asking
if
Simon
who [is]
called
Peter
here
is lodged
-
And
of Peter
thinking
over
the
vision
said
the
Spirit
Behold
men
three
are seeking
you
But
having risen
go down
and
proceed
with
them
nothing
doubting
because
I
have sent
them
Having gone down
then
Peter
to
the
men
he said
Behold
I
am
whom
you seek
what [is]
the
cause
for
which
you are here
-
And
they said
Cornelius
a centurion
a man
righteous
and
fearing
-
God
being well testified to
then
by
all
the
nation
of the
Jews
was divinely instructed
by
an angel
holy
to send for
you
to
the
house
of him
and
to hear
a message
from
you
Having called in
therefore
them
he lodged [them]
On the
now
next day
having risen up
he went forth
with
them
and
some
of the
brothers
those
from
Joppa
went with
him
On the
now
next day
he entered
into
-
Caesarea
-
and
Cornelius
was
expecting
them
having called together
the
relatives
of him
and
-
close
friends
As
then
was
-
entering
-
Peter
having met
him
-
Cornelius
having fallen
at
the
feet
worshiped [him]
-
But
Peter
lifted up
him
saying
Rise up
also
I
myself
a man
am
And
talking with
him
he entered
and
he finds
having gathered together
many
He was saying
then
to
them
You
know
how
unlawful
it is
for a man
a Jew
to unite himself
or
to come near
to a foreigner
To me
however
God
has shown
not
common
or
unclean
to call
man
Therefore
also
without objection
I came
having been summoned
I inquire
therefore
for what
reason
did you summon
me
And
-
Cornelius
was saying
Ago
four
days
until
this
the
hour
I was
at the
ninth hour
praying
in
the
house
of me
and
behold
a man
stood
before
me
in
apparel
bright
and
said
Cornelius
has been heard
your
-
prayer
and
the
alms
of you
have been remembered
before
-
God
Send
therefore
to
Joppa
and
call for
Simon
who
is called
Peter
He
lodges
in
[the] house
of Simon
a tanner
by
[the] sea
At once
therefore
I sent
to
you
you
then
well
did
having come
Now
therefore
all
we
before
-
God
are present
to hear
all
the things
having been commanded
you
by
the
Lord
Having opened
then
Peter
the
mouth
he said
Of
a truth
I understand
that
not
is
One who shows partiality
-
God
but
in
every
nation
the [one]
fearing
Him
and
working
righteousness
acceptable
to Him
is
the
word
that
He sent
to the
sons
of Israel
proclaiming the gospel
peace
by
Jesus
Christ
He
is
of all
Lord
You yourselves
know
the
having come
declaration
through
all
-
Judea
having begun
from
-
Galilee
after
the
baptism
that
proclaimed
John
Jesus
-
from
Nazareth
how
anointed
Him
-
God
Spirit
with Holy
and
with power
who
went about
doing good
and
healing
all
those
being oppressed
by
the
devil
because
-
God
was
with
Him
And
we
[are] witnesses
of all things
that
He did
in
both
the
region
of the
Jews
and
Jerusalem
whom
also
they put to death
having hanged [Him]
on
a tree
This One
-
God
raised up
on
the
third
day
and
gave
Him
manifest
to become
not
to all
the
people
but
to [the] witnesses
-
having been chosen beforehand
by
-
God
to us
who
did eat with
and
drink with
Him
after
-
rising
His
out from
[the] dead
And
He instructed
us
to proclaim
to the
people
and
to testify fully
that
He
is
the [One]
having been appointed
by
-
God
[as] judge
of living
and
dead
To Him
all
the
prophets
bear witness
[that] forgiveness
of sins
receives
through
the
name
of Him
everyone
-
believing
in
Him
Still
speaking
-
of Peter
the
words
these
fell
the
Spirit
-
Holy
upon
all
those
hearing
the
word
And
were amazed
the
from
[the] circumcision
believers
as many as
had come with
-
Peter
that
even
upon
the
Gentiles
the
gift
of the
Holy
Spirit
has been poured out
They were hearing
for
them
speaking
in tongues
and
magnifying
-
God
Then
answered
Peter
If not
the
water
is able
to withhold
anyone
-
not
to baptize
these
who
the
Spirit
-
Holy
have received
just as
also [have]
we
He commanded
now
them
in
the
name
of Jesus
Christ
to be baptized
Then
they asked
him
to remain
days
some
Heard
now
the
apostles
and
the
brothers
-
being
in
-
Judea
that
also
the
Gentiles
had received
the
word
-
of God
When
also
went up
Peter
to
Jerusalem
began contending
with
him
those
of
[the] circumcision
saying
-
You went
to
men
uncircumcision
having
and
ate with
them
Having begun
now
Peter
he set [it] forth
to them
in order
saying
I
was
in
[the] city
of Joppa
praying
and
I saw
in
a trance
a vision
descending
a vessel
certain
like
a sheet
great
by four
corners
being let down
out of
-
heaven
and
it came down
as far as
me
On
it
having looked intently
I was observing [it]
and
I saw
the
quadrupeds
of the
earth
and
the
wild beasts
and
the
creeping things
and
the
birds
of the
air
I heard
then
also
a voice
saying
to me
Having risen up
Peter
kill
and
eat
I said
however
In no way
Lord
for
common
or
unclean
nothing ever
has entered
into
the
mouth
of me
Answered
however
for
a second [time]
the voice
out of
-
heaven
What
-
God
has cleansed
you
not
do call unholy
This
now
happened
on
three times
and
was drawn up
again
all
into
-
heaven
And
behold
immediately
three
men
stood
at
the
house
in
which
I was
having been sent
from
Caesarea
to
me
Told
now
the
Spirit
me
to go with
them
not
having discriminated
Went
now
with
me
also
-
six
brothers
these
and
we entered
into
the
house
of the
man
He related
then
to us
how
he had seen
the
angel
in
the
house
of him
having stood
and
having said
Send forth
to
Joppa
and
send for
Simon
who
is called
Peter
who
will speak
words
to
you
in
which
will be saved
you
and
all
the
household
of you
In
then
-
beginning
my
to speak
fell
the
Spirit
-
Holy
upon
them
even as
also
upon
us
in [the]
beginning
I remembered
then
the
word
of the
Lord
how
He had said
John
indeed
baptized
with water
you
however
will be baptized
with [the]
Spirit
Holy
If
then
the
same
gift
has given
to them
-
God
as
also
to us
having believed
on
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
I
how
was
able
to forbid
-
God
Having heard
then
these things
they were silent
and
glorified
-
God
saying
Then indeed
also
to the
Gentiles
-
God
-
repentance
unto
life
has given
Those
indeed
therefore
having been scattered
by
the
tribulation
-
having taken place
over
Stephen
passed through
to
Phoenicia
and
Cyprus
and
Antioch
to no one
speaking
the
word
if
not
only
to Jews
Were
however
some
of
them
men
of Cyprus
and
of Cyrene
who
having come
into
Antioch
were speaking
also
to
the
Hellenists
proclaiming the gospel
the
Lord
Jesus
And
was
[the] hand
of [the] Lord
with
them
[a] great
then
number
-
having believed
turned
to
the
Lord
Was heard
now
the
report
in
the
ears
of the
church
-
being
in
Jerusalem
concerning
them
and
they sent forth
Barnabas
as far as
Antioch
who
having come
and
having seen
the
grace
of
-
God
rejoiced
and
was exhorting
all
with
resolute purpose
-
of heart
to abide
the
Lord
For
he was
a man
good
and
full
of [the] Spirit
Holy
and
of faith
And
was added
a crowd
large
to the
Lord
He went forth
then
to
Tarsus
to seek
Saul
and
having found [him]
he brought [him]
to
Antioch
It came to pass [that]
now
they
also
a year
whole
gathered together
in
the
church
and
taught
a crowd
large
Were called
then
first
in
Antioch
the
disciples
Christians
In
these
now
-
days
came down
from
Jerusalem
prophets
to
Antioch
Having risen up
now
one
of
them
named
Agabus
he signified
by
the
Spirit [that]
a famine
great
is about
to be
over
all
the
world
which
came to pass
under
Claudius
-
And
the disciples
as
was prospered
anyone
determined
each
of them
for
ministry
to send
to the
dwelling
in
-
Judea
brothers
which
also
they did
having sent [it]
to
the
elders
by [the]
hand
of Barnabas
and
Saul
At
that
now
-
time
put forth
Herod
the
king
the
hands
to mistreat
some
of those
of
the
church
He put to death
then
James
the
brother
of John
with the sword
Having seen
now
that
pleasing
it is
to the
Jews
he proceeded
to take
also
Peter
these were
now
days
of the
Unleavened [Bread]
whom
also
having seized
he put
in
prison
having delivered [him]
to four
sets of four
soldiers
to guard
him
intending
after
the
Passover
to bring out
him
to the
people
-
Indeed
therefore
Peter
was kept
in
the
prison
prayer
however
was
fervent
being made
by
the
church
to
-
God
concerning
him
When
then
was about
to bring forth
him
-
Herod
the
night
that
was
-
Peter
sleeping
between
two
soldiers
having been bound
with chains
two
guards
also
before
the
door
were watching
the
prison
And
behold
an angel
of [the] Lord
stood by
and
a light
shone
in
the
cell
Having struck
then
the
side
-
of Peter
he woke up
him
saying
Rise up
in
haste
And
fell
of him
the
chains
off
the
hands
Said
then
the
angel
to
him
Gird yourself about
and
put on
the
sandals
of you
He did
and
so
And
he says
to him
Wrap around [you]
the
cloak
of you
and
follow
me
And
having gone forth
he was following
and
not
did know
that
real
is
what
is happening
by means of
the
angel
he was thinking
however
a vision
he saw
Having passed through
then
a first
guard
and
a second
they came
to
the
gate
-
iron
-
leading
into
the
city
which
by itself
opened
to them
And
having gone out
they went on through
street
one
and
immediately
departed
the
angel
from
him
And
-
Peter
to
himself
having come
said
Now
I know
truly
that
has sent forth
the
Lord
the
angel
of Him
and
delivered
me
out of
[the] hand
of Herod
and
all
the
expectation
of the
people
of the
Jews
Having considered [it]
also
he came
to
the
house
of
Mary
the
mother
of John
who
is called
Mark
where
were
many
having gathered together
and
praying
Having knocked
then
of him
[at] the
door
of the
gate
came
a girl
to answer
named
Rhoda
And
having recognized
the
voice
-
of Peter
from
-
joy
not
she opened
the
gate
having run in
but
she reported
to be standing
-
Peter
before
the
gate
-
And
to
her
they said
You are out of your mind
-
But
she kept insisting
[it] so
to be
-
And
they kept saying
The
angel
it is
of him
-
But
Peter
continued
knocking
having opened [it]
then
they saw
him
and
were amazed
Having made a sign
then
to them
with the
hand
to be silent
he related
to them
how
the
Lord
him
had brought
out of
the
prison
He said
then
Report
to James
and
to the
brothers
these things
And
having gone out
he went
to
another
place
Having come
now
day
there was
disturbance
no
small
among
the
soldiers
what
then [of]
-
Peter
has become
Herod
then
having sought after
him
and
not
having found [him]
having examined
the
guards
he commanded [them]
to be led away [to death]
And
having gone down
from
-
Judea
to
Caesarea
he stayed [there]
He had been
now
furiously angry
with [the] Tyrians
and
Sidonians
with one accord
then
they came
to
him
And
having gained
Blastus
who [was]
over
the
bedchamber
of the
king
they were seeking
peace
because of
-
being nourished
their
-
region
by
the
kingâs
On the appointed
now
day
-
Herod
having put on
apparel
royal
having sat
on
the
throne
was making an address
to
them
-
And
the people
were crying out
Of a god
[this is the] voice
and
not
of a man
Immediately
then
struck
him
an angel
of [the] Lord
in return
for that
not
he gave
the
glory
-
to God
and
having been
eaten by worms
he breathed his last
-
But
the word
-
of God
continued to grow
and
to multiply
Barnabas
then
and
Saul
returned
to
Jerusalem
having fulfilled
the
mission
having taken with [them]
John
the [one]
having been called
Mark
There were
now
in
Antioch
in
the
being [there]
church
prophets
and
teachers
-
both
Barnabas
and
Simeon
who
was called
Niger
and
Lucius
the
Cyrenian
Manaen
also
Herod
the
tetrarch
brought up with
and
Saul
As were ministering
now
they
to the
Lord
and
fasting
said
the
Spirit
-
Holy
Set apart
then
to Me
-
Barnabas
and
Saul
for
the
work
to which
I have called
them
Then
having fasted
and
having prayed
and
having laid
the
hands
on them
they sent [them] off
They
indeed
therefore
having been sent forth
by
the
Holy
Spirit
went down
to
Seleucia
From there
then
they sailed
to
Cyprus
And
having come
into
Salamis
they began proclaiming
the
word
-
of God
in
the
synagogues
of the
Jews
They had
now
also
John [as]
a helper
Having passed through
now
all
the
island
as far as
Paphos
they found
a man
a certain
magician
a false prophet
Jewish
whose
name
[was] Bar-Jesus
who
was
with
the
proconsul
Sergius
Paulus
man
an intelligent
He
having called to [him]
Barnabas
and
Saul
desired
to hear
the
word
-
of God
Was opposing
however
them
Elymas
the
magician
thus
for
means
the
name
of him
seeking
to turn away
the
proconsul
from
the
faith
Saul
then
-
also [called]
Paul
having been filled
[the] Spirit
Holy
having looked intently
upon
him
said
O
full
of all
deceit
and
all
craft
son
of [the] devil
enemy
of all
righteousness
not
will you cease
perverting
the
ways
the
of Lord
-
straight
And
now
behold
[the] hand
of the Lord
[is] upon
you
and
you will be
blind
not
seeing
the
sun
during
a season
Immediately
then
fell
upon
him
mist
and
darkness
and
going about
he was seeking
someone to lead [him] by the hand
Then
having seen
the
proconsul
that
having happened
he believed
being astonished
at
the
teaching
of the
Lord
Having sailed
then
from
-
Paphos
[with] those
around [him]
Paul
came
to
Perga
-
of Pamphylia
John
however
having departed
from
them
returned
to
Jerusalem
They
now
having passed through
from
-
Perga
came
to
Antioch
-
of Pisidia
and
having gone
into
the
synagogue
on the
day
of the
Sabbaths
they sat down
After
then
the
reading
of the
law
and
of the
Prophets
sent
the
rulers of the synagogue
to
them
saying
Men
brothers
if
any
there is
among
you
a word
of exhortation
toward
the
people
speak
Having risen up
then
Paul
and
having made a sign
with the
hand
he said
Men
Israelites
and
those
fearing
-
God
listen
The
God
of the
people
this
of Israel
chose
the
fathers
of us
and
the
people
exalted
in
the
sojourn
in
[the] land
of Egypt
and
with
arm
uplifted
brought
them
out of
it
and
of about
forty years
for a period
He endured the ways
their
in
the
wilderness
and
having destroyed
nations
seven
in
[the] land
of Canaan
He gave as an inheritance
the
land
of them
during
years
four hundred
and
fifty
And
after
these things
He gave [them]
judges
until
Samuel
prophet
Then
they asked for
a king
and
gave
to them
-
God
-
Saul
son
of Kish
a man
of [the]
tribe
of Benjamin
years
forty
And
having removed
him
He raised up
-
David
to them
as
king
to whom
also
He said
having carried witness
I have found
David
the
[son]
of Jesse
a man
according to
the
heart
of Me
who
will do
all
the
will
of Me
Of this [man]
-
God
of
the
seed
according to
promise
has brought
-
to Israel
[the] Savior
Jesus
having proclaimed
John
before [the]
face
of the
coming
of Him
a baptism
of repentance
to all
the
people
of Israel
While
then
was fulfilling
John
the
course
he was saying
Whom
me
do you suppose
to be
Not
am
I [he]
but
behold
He comes
after
me
of whom
not
I am
worthy
a
sandal
of the
feet
to untie
Men
brothers
sons
of [the] family
of Abraham
and
those
among
you
fearing
-
God
to us
the
message
of the
salvation
this
has been sent
Those
for
dwelling
in
Jerusalem
and
the
rulers
of them
Him
not having known
and
the
voices
of the
prophets
that
on
every
Sabbath
are being read
having condemned [Him]
they fulfilled [them]
And
no
cause
of death
having found
they begged
Pilate
to put to death
him
When
then
they had finished
all
the things
about
Him
having been written
having taken [Him] down
from
the
tree
they put [Him]
in
a tomb
-
But
God
raised
Him
out from
[the] dead
who
appeared
for
days
many
to those
having come up with
Him
from
-
Galilee
to
Jerusalem
who
now
are
witnesses
of Him
to
the
people
And
we
to you
preach the gospel
the
to
the
fathers
promise
having been made
that
this
-
God
has fulfilled
to the
children
to us
having raised up
Jesus
as
also
in
the
psalm
it has been written
the
second
Son
of Me
are
You
I
today
have begotten
you
That
then
He raised
Him
out from
[the] dead
no more
being about
to return
to
decay
thus
He spoke
-
I will give
to you
the
holy [blessings]
of David
the
sure [blessings]
Therefore
also
in
another
He says
Not
You will allow
the
Holy One
of you
to see
decay
David
indeed
for
in his own
generation
having served
the
-
of God
purpose
fell asleep
and
was added
to
the
fathers
of him
and
saw
decay
The [One]
however
-
God
raised up
not
did see
decay
Known
therefore
be it
to you
men
brothers
that
through
this One
to you
forgiveness
of sins
is proclaimed
And
from
all things
from which
not
you were able
in
[the] law
of Moses
to be justified






Take heed
therefore
lest
might come about
that
having been said
in
the
prophets
Behold
-
scoffers
and
wonder
and
perish
for
a work
am working
I
in
the
days
of you
a work
that
never
not
you would believe
even if
one
should declare it
to you
Having departed
then
they
were begging
on
the
next
Sabbath
to be spoken
to them
the
words
these
Having broken up
then
the
synagogue
followed
many
of the
Jews
and
of the
worshipping
converts
-
Paul
and
-
Barnabas
who
speaking
to them
kept persuading
them
to continue
in the
grace
-
of God
On the
now
coming
Sabbath
almost
all
the
city
was gathered together
to hear
the
word
-
of the Lord
Having seen
however
the
Jews
the
crowds
they were filled
with jealousy
and
began contradicting
the things
by
Paul
spoken
blaspheming
Having spoken boldly
also
-
Paul
and
-
Barnabas
said
To you
it was
necessary
first
to be spoken
the
word
-
of God
but since
you thrust away
it
and
not
worthy
you judge
yourselves
-
of eternal
life
behold
we are turning
to
the
Gentiles
Thus
for
has commanded
us
the
Lord
I have set
you
for
a light
of [the] Gentiles
-
to be
you
for
salvation
to
[the] uttermost part
of the
earth
Hearing [it]
then
the
Gentiles
were rejoicing
and
glorifying
the
word
of the
Lord
and
believed
as many as
were
appointed
to
life
eternal
Was carried
then
the
word
of the
Lord
through
all
the
region
The
but
Jews
incited
the
worshipping
women
-
of honorable position
and
the
principals
of the
city
and
they stirred up
a persecution
against
-
Paul
and
Barnabas
and
expelled
them
from
the
district
of them
-
But
having shaken off
the
dust
of the
feet
against
them
they went
to
Iconium
-
and
the disciples
were filled
with joy
and [the]
Spirit
Holy
It came to pass
now
in
Iconium
according to
the
same
entered
they
into
the
synagogue
of the
Jews
and
spoke
so
that
believed
of Jewish
both
and
Greeks
a great
number
The
however
unbelieving
Jews
stirred up
and
poisoned
the
minds
of the
Gentiles
against
the
brothers
A long
indeed
therefore
time
they stayed
speaking boldly
for
the
Lord
the [One]
bearing witness
to
the
word
of the
grace
of Him
granting
signs
and
wonders
to be done
through
the
hands
of them
Was divided
now
the
multitude
of the
city
and
some
indeed
were
with
the
Jews
some
however
with
the
apostles
When
then
there was
a rush
of the
Gentiles
both
and
Jews
with
the
rulers
of them
to mistreat
and
to stone
them
having become aware
they fled
to
the
cities
-
of Lycaonia
Lystra
and
Derbe
and
the
surrounding region
and there
preaching the gospel
they continued
And
a certain
man
crippled
in
Lystra
in the
feet
was sitting
lame
from
[the] womb
of [the] mother
of him
who
never
had walked
This [man]
heard
-
Paul
speaking
who
having looked intently
at him
and
having seen
that
he has
faith
-
to be healed
said
in a loud
voice
Stand
on
the
feet
of you
upright
And
he sprang up
and
began to walk
-
And
the crowds
having seen
what
had done
Paul
lifted up
the
voice
of them
in Lycaonian
saying
The
gods
having become like
men
have come down
to
us
They began calling
then
-
Barnabas
Zeus
-
and
Paul
Hermes
because
he
was
the
leading
-
speaker
-
And
the priest
-
of Zeus
-
being
just outside
the
city
oxen
and
wreaths
to
the
gates
having brought
with
the
crowds
was desiring
to sacrifice
Having heard
however
the
apostles
Barnabas
and
Paul
having torn
the
garments
of them
rushed out
into
the
crowd
crying out
and
saying
Men
why
these things
do you
Also
we
of like nature
are
with you
men
proclaiming the gospel
to you
from
these
-
vanities
to turn
to
God
[the] living
who
made
the
heaven
and
the
earth
and
the
sea
and
all
the things
in
them
who
in
the
past
generations
allowed
all
the
nations
to go
the
ways
of them
And yet
not
without witness
Himself
He has left
doing good
from heaven
to you
rains
giving
and
seasons
fruitful
filling
with food
and
gladness
the
hearts
of you
And
these things
saying
hardly
they stopped
the
crowds
-
not
sacrificing
to them
Came
however
from
Antioch
and
Iconium
Jews
and
having persuaded
the
crowds
and
having stoned
-
Paul
they dragged [him]
outside
the
city
supposing
him
to have died
Having surrounded
however
the
disciples
him
having risen up
he entered
into
the
city
And
on the
next day
he went away
with
-
Barnabas
to
Derbe
Having proclaimed the gospel to
then
the
city
that
and
having discipled
many
they returned
to
-
Lystra
and
to
Iconium
and
to
Antioch
strengthening
the
souls
of the
disciples
exhorting [them]
to continue
in the
faith
and
that
through
many
tribulations
it behooves
us
to enter
into
the
kingdom
-
of God
Having chosen
now
for them
in every
church
elders
having prayed
with
fasting
they committed
them
to the
Lord
in
whom
they had believed
And
having passed through
-
Pisidia
they came
to
-
Pamphylia
and
having spoken
in
Perga
the
word
they went down
to
Attalia
And from there
they sailed
to
Antioch
from where
they had
been committed
to the
grace
-
of God
for
the
work
that
they had fulfilled
Having arrived
now
and
having gathered together
the
church
they began declaring
all that
had done
-
God
with
them
and
that
He had opened
to the
Gentiles
a door
of faith
They remained
then
time
no
little
with
the
disciples
And
certain ones
having come down
from
-
Judea
were teaching
the
brothers
-
If
not
you are circumcised
according to the
custom
-
of Moses
not
you are able
to be saved
Having been brought about
then
commotion
and
discussion
no
small
-
by Paul
and
-
Barnabas
with
them
they appointed
to go up
Paul
and
Barnabas
and
certain
others
out from
them
to
the
apostles
and
elders
to
Jerusalem
about
the
question
this
They
indeed
therefore
having been sent forward
by
the
church
were passing through
-
both
Phoenicia
and
Samaria
relating in detail
the
conversion
of the
Gentiles
and
they were bringing
joy
great
to all
the
brothers
Having come
then
to
Jerusalem
they were welcomed
by
the
church
and
the
apostles
and
the
elders
They declared
then
all that
-
God
had done
with
them
Rose up
now
certain
of those
of
the
sect
of the
Pharisees
who believed
saying
-
It is necessary
to circumcise
them
to command [them]
then
to keep
the
law
of Moses
Were gathered together
then
the
apostles
and
the
elders
to see
about
the
matter
this
Of much
now
discussion
having taken place
having risen up
Peter
said
to
them
Men
brothers
you
know
that
from
days
early
among
you
chose
-
God
by
the
mouth
of me
to hear
the
Gentiles
the
word
of the
gospel
and
to believe
And
the
heart-knowing
God
bore witness
to them
having given [them]
the
Spirit
-
Holy
as
also
to us
and
not one
He made distinction
between
us
also
and
them
by the
faith
having purified
the
hearts
of them
Now
therefore
why
are you testing
-
God
to put
a yoke
upon
the
neck
of the
disciples
that
neither
the
fathers
of us
nor
we
have been able
to bear
But
by
the
grace
of
[the] Lord
Jesus
we believe
to be saved
in
[the] same
manner [as]
they also
Kept silent
now
all
the
multitude
and
were listening to
Barnabas
and
Paul
relating
what
had done
-
God
signs
and
wonders
among
the
Gentiles
by
them
After
now
-
were silent
they
answered
James
saying
Men
brothers
hear
me
Simeon
has related
how
first
-
God
visited
to take
out of
[the] Gentiles
a people
for the
name
of Him
And
with this
agree
the
words
of the
prophets
as
it is written
After
these things
I will return
and
will rebuild
the
tabernacle
of David
which
has fallen
and
the
ruins
of it
I will rebuild
and
I will set upright
it
so that
-
may seek out
the
remnant
-
of men
the
Lord
and
all
the
Gentiles
upon
whom
has been called
the
name
of Me
upon
them
says
[the] Lord
doing
these things
known
from
eternity
Therefore
I
judge
not
to trouble
those who
from
the
Gentiles
are turning
to
-
God
but
to write
to them
-
to abstain from
the
pollutions
of the
idols
and
-
sexual immorality
and
which is strangled
and
from
blood
Moses
for
from
generations
of old
in every
city
[ones]
proclaiming
him
has
in
the
synagogues
on
every
Sabbath
being read
Then
it seemed good
to the
apostles
and
to the
elders
with
all
the
church
having chosen
men
out from
them
to send
to
Antioch
with
-
Paul
and
Barnabas
Judas
-
called
Barsabbas
and
Silas
men
leading
among
the
brothers
having written
by
[the] hand
of them
The
apostles
and
the
elders
brothers
To those
in
-
Antioch
and
Syria
and
Cilicia
brothers
-
among
the Gentiles
Greetings
Inasmuch as
we have heard
that
some
from
us
troubled
you
by words
upsetting
the
minds
of you
to whom
not
we had given instructions
it seemed good
to us
having come
with one accord
having chosen
men
to send
to
you
with
the
beloved
of us
Barnabas
and
Paul
men
having handed over
the
lives
of them
for
the
name
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
We have sent
therefore
Judas
and
Silas
and
they
by
word [of mouth]
are telling [you]
the
same things
It seemed good
for
to the
Spirit
-
Holy
and
to us
no
further
to lay
upon you
burden
except
these
-
necessary things
to abstain
from things sacrificed to idols
and
from blood
and
from what is strangled
and
from sexual immorality
From
these
keeping
yourselves
well
you will do
Farewell
They
indeed
therefore
having been sent off
went
to
Antioch
and
having gathered
the
multitude
they delivered
the
letter
Having read [it]
now
they rejoiced
at
the
encouragement
Judas
both
and
Silas
also
themselves
prophets
being
by
talk
much
exhorted
the
brothers
and
strengthened [them]
Having continued
then
a time
they were sent away
in
peace
from
the
brothers
to
those
having sent
them
Paul
however
and
Barnabas
stayed
in
Antioch
teaching
and
proclaiming the good news
with
also
others
many
the
word
of the
Lord
After
now
some
days
said
to
Barnabas
Paul
Having turned back
indeed
let us look after
the
brothers
in
city
every
in
which
we have announced
the
word
of the
Lord
how
they are
Barnabas
now
purposed
to take along
also
-
John
-
called
Mark
Paul
however
thought fit
the [one]
having withdrawn
from
them
from
Pamphylia
and
not
having gone with
them
to
the
work
not
to take along
him
Arose
therefore
a sharp disagreement
so that
separated
they
from
one another
-
and
Barnabas
having taken
-
Mark
sailed
to
Cyprus
Paul
however
having chosen
Silas
went forth
having been committed
to the
grace
of the
Lord
by
the
brothers
He was passing through
then
-
Syria
and
Cilicia
strengthening
the
churches
He came
then
also
to
Derbe
and
to
Lystra
And
behold
a disciple
certain
was
there
named
Timothy
[the] son
of a woman
Jewish
believing
father
however
a Greek
who
was well spoken of
by
the
in
Lystra
and
Iconium
brothers
This one
wanted
-
Paul
with
him
to go forth
and
having taken
he circumcised
him
on account of
the
Jews
-
being
in
the
parts
those
they knew
for
all
that
a Greek
the
father
of him
was
While
then
they were passing through
the
cities
they were delivering
to them
to keep
the
decrees
-
decided on
by
the
apostles
and
elders
who [were]
in
Jerusalem
The
indeed
therefore
churches
were strengthened
in the
faith
and
were increasing
-
in number
every
day
Having passed through
then
-
Phrygia
and
the Galatian
region
having been forbidden
by
the
Holy
Spirit
to speak
the
word
in
-
Asia
having come
then
down to
-
Mysia
they were attempting
into
-
Bithynia
to go
and
not
did allow
them
the
Spirit
of Jesus
having passed by
then
-
Mysia
they came down
to
Troas
And
a vision
during
night
-
to Paul
appeared
A man
of Macedonia
certain
was
standing
and
beseeching
him
and
saying
Having passed over
into
Macedonia
help
us
When
now
the
vision
he had seen
immediately
we sought
to go forth
to
Macedonia
concluding
that
had called
us
-
God
to preach the gospel
to them
Having sailed
then
from
Troas
we made a straight course
to
Samothrace
-
and
the following day
to
Nea
Polis
and from there
to
Philippi
which
is
[the] leading
of the
district
of Macedonia
city
a colony
We were
now
in
this
-
city
staying
days
some
On the
then
day
of the
Sabbaths
we went forth
outside
the
city gate
by
a river
where
was customary
[a place of] prayer
to be
And
having sat down
we began speaking
to the
having gathered
women
And
a certain
woman
named
Lydia
a seller of purple
of [the] city
of Thyatira
worshiping
-
God
was listening
of whom
the
Lord
opened
the
heart
to attend
to the things
being spoken
by
Paul
When
then
she was baptized
and
the
house
of her
she begged
saying
If
you have judged
me
faithful
to the
Lord
to be
having entered
into
the
house
of me
abide
And
she persuaded
us
It happened
now
going
of us
to
the
[place of] prayer
a girl
certain
having
a spirit
of Python
met
us
who
gain
much
was bringing
the
masters
of her
by fortune-telling
She
having followed
-
Paul
and
us
was crying out
saying
These
-
men
servants
of the
God
-
Most High
are
who
proclaim
to you
[the] way
of salvation
This
then
she continued
for
many
days
Having been distressed
then
Paul
and
having turned
to the
spirit
he said
I command
you
in
[the] name
of Jesus
Christ
to come out
from
her
And
it came out
[the] same
-
hour
Having seen
now
the
masters
of her
that
was gone
the
hope
of the
profit
of them
having taken hold of
-
Paul
and
-
Silas
they dragged [them]
into
the
marketplace
before
the
rulers
and
having brought up
them
to the
magistrates
they said
These
-
men
exceedingly trouble
of us
the
city
Jews
being
and
preach
customs
that
not
it is lawful
for us
to accept
nor
to practice
Romans
being
And
rose up together
the
crowd
against
them
and
the
magistrates
having torn off
of them
the
garments
were commanding that
they be beaten with rods
Many
then
having laid
on them
blows
they cast [them]
into
prison
having charged
the
jailer
securely
to keep
them
who
an order
such
having received
threw
them
into
the
inner
prison
and
the
feet
fastened
of them
in
the
stocks
Toward
now
-
midnight
Paul
and
Silas
praying
were singing praises to
-
God
Were listening
now
to them
the
prisoners
Suddenly
then
earthquake
there was
a great
so that
were shaken
the
foundations
of the
prison house
were opened
then
immediately
the
doors
all
and
of all
the
chains
were loosed
Awoken
then
having been
the
jailer
and
having seen
open
the
doors
of the
prison
having drawn
his
sword
he was about
himself
to kill
supposing
to have escaped
the
prisoners
Called out
however
Paul
loud
in a voice
saying
Not
do
to yourself
harm
all
for
we are
here
Having called for
now
lights
he rushed in
and
terrified
having become
he fell down before
-
Paul
and
Silas
And
having brought
them
out
he was saying
Sirs
what
of me
is necessary
to do
that
I may be saved
-
And
they said
Believe
on
the
Lord
Jesus
and
you will be saved
you
and
the
household
of you
And
they spoke
to him
the
word
of the
Lord
along with
all
those
in
the
house
of him
And
having taken
them
in
that
-
hour
of the
night
he washed [them]
from
the
wounds
and
he was baptized
he
and
the [household]
of him
all
immediately
Having brought
then
them
into
the
house
he laid
a table [for them]
and
rejoiced
with all [his] household
having believed
-
in God
Day
then
having come
sent
the
magistrates
the
officers
saying
Release
the
men
those
Reported
then
the
jailer
the
words
these
to
-
Paul
-
Have sent
the
captains
that
you may be let go
Now
therefore
having gone out
depart
in
peace
-
But
Paul
was saying
to
them
Having beaten
us
publicly
uncondemned
men
Romans
being
they cast [us]
into
prison
and
now
secretly
us
do they throw out
No
indeed
Instead
having come
themselves
us
let them bring out
Reported
then
to the
captains
the
officers
the
words
these
They were afraid
then
having heard
that
Romans
they are
And
having come
they appealed to
them
and
having brought [them] out
they were asking [them]
to go out
of
the
city
Having gone forth
then
out of
the
prison
they came
to
-
Lydia
and
having seen [them]
they exhorted
the
brothers
and
departed
Having passed through
then
-
Amphipolis
and
-
Apollonia
they came
to
Thessalonica
where
was
a synagogue
of the
Jews
According to
now
the
custom
-
with Paul
he went in
to
them
and
for
Sabbaths
three
he reasoned
with them
from
the
Scriptures
opening
and
setting forth
that
the
Christ
it behooved
to have suffered
and
to have risen
out from
[the] dead
and
that
this
is
the
Christ
-
Jesus
whom
I
preach
to you
And
some
of
them
were obedient
and
joined themselves
-
to Paul
and
-
to Silas
-
along with
worshipping
Greeks
a multitude
great
women
then
of the
leading
not
a few
Having become jealous
now
the
Jews
and
having taken to [them]
of the
market-loungers
men
certain
wicked
and
having collected a crowd
they set in uproar
the
city
and
having assailed
the
house
of Jason
they were seeking
them
to bring out
to
the
people
Not
having found
however
them
they dragged
Jason
and
certain
brothers
before
the
city authorities
crying out
-
The [ones]
the
world
having upset
these
also
here
are come
whom
has received
Jason
And
these
all
contrary to
the
decrees
of Caesar
do
king
another
proclaiming
to be
Jesus
They stirred up
then
the
crowd
and
the
city authorities
hearing
these things
And
having taken
-
security
from
-
Jason
and
the
rest
they let go
them
-
And
the brothers
immediately
by
night
sent away
-
both
Paul
and
-
Silas
to
Berea
who
having arrived
into
the
synagogue
of the
Jews
went
These
now
were
more noble
than those
in
Thessalonica
who
received
the
word
with
all
readiness
on the
every
day
examining
the
Scriptures
if
were
these things
so
Many
indeed
therefore
of
them
believed
and
of the
Grecian
women
-
prominent
and
men
not
a few
When
however
knew
those
from
-
Thessalonica
Jews
that
also
in
-
Berea
was proclaimed
by
-
Paul
the
word
-
of God
they came
there also
stirring up
and
agitating
the
crowds
Immediately
also
then
-
Paul
sent away
the
brothers
to go
as
to
the
sea
remained
but
-
both
Silas
and
-
Timothy
there
Those
now
escorting
-
Paul
brought [him]
unto
Athens
and
having received
a command
unto
-
Silas
and
-
Timothy
that
as
quickly as possible
they should come
to
him
they departed
In
now
-
Athens
waiting for
them
-
of Paul
was provoked
the
spirit
of him
in
him
seeing
utterly idolatrous
to be
the
city
He was reasoning
indeed
therefore
in
the
synagogue
with the
Jews
and
those
worshiping
and
in
the
marketplace
on
every
day
with
those
meeting [him]
Some
then
also
of the
Epicureans
and
Stoics
philosophers
encountered
him
And
some
were saying
What
-
may desire
of the
babbler
this
to say
Others
however
Of foreign
gods
he seems
a proclaimer
to be
because
-
Jesus
and
the
resurrection
he was proclaiming the gospel of
Having taken hold
also
of him
to
the
Ares
Hill
they brought [him]
saying
Are we able
to know
what [is]
the
new
this
which
by
you
is spoken
teaching
Strange things
for
some
you are bringing
to
the
ears
of us
We resolve
therefore
to know
what
wish
these things
to be
[The] Athenians
now
all
and
the
visiting
strangers
in
nothing
else
spent their time
than
to tell
something
and
to hear
something
new
Having stood
then
Paul
in
[the] midst
of the
Ares
Hill
he was saying
Men
Athenians
in
all things
as
very religious
you
I behold
Passing through
for
and
beholding
the
objects of worship
of you
I found
even
an altar
on
which
had been inscribed
To an unknown
God
Whom
therefore
not knowing
you worship
Him
I
proclaim
to you
The
God
-
having made
the
world
and
all things
that [are]
in
it
He
of heaven
and
earth
being
Lord
not
in
hand-made
temples
dwells
nor
by
hands
of men
is He served
as needing
anything
Himself
giving
to all
life
and
breath
and
the
all
He made
then
of
one
every
nation
of men
to dwell
upon
all
the face
of the
earth
having determined
[the] appointed
times
and
the
boundaries
of the
habitation
of them
to seek
-
God
if
perhaps
indeed
they might palpate for
Him
and
might find Him
And
indeed
not
far
from
one
each
of us
He is
In
Him
for
we live
and
move
and
are
As
also
some
of the
among
you
poets
have said
Of [Him]
for
also
offspring
we are
Offspring
therefore
being
-
of God
not
we ought
to consider
to gold
or
to silver
or
to stone
a graven thing
of craft
and
imagination
of man
the
Divine Being
to be
like
The
indeed
therefore
times
-
of ignorance
having overlooked
-
God
-
now
He commands
-
men
all
everywhere
to repent
because
He set
a day
in
which
He is about
to judge
the
world
in
righteousness
by
a man
whom
He appointed
a guarantee
having provided
to all
having raised
Him
out from
[the] dead
Having heard of
now
a resurrection
of [the] dead
some
indeed
began to mock [him]
some
however
said
We will hear
you
concerning
this
also
again
Thus
-
Paul
went out
from
[the] midst
of them
Some
however
men
having joined themselves
to him
believed
among
whom
also
[were] Dionysius
the
Areopagite
and
a woman
named
Damaris
and
others
with
them
And after
these things
having departed
from
-
Athens
he came
to
Corinth
And
having found
a certain
Jew
named
Aquila
of Pontus
-
a native
recently
having come
from
-
Italy
and
Priscilla
wife
of him
because of
-
having commanded
Claudius
to depart
all
the
Jews
out of
-
Rome
he came
to them
and
due to
of the
same trade
being
he stayed
with
them
and
worked
they were
for
tentmakers
by the
trade
He was reasoning
now
in
the
synagogue
on
every
Sabbath
persuading
both
Jews
and
Greeks
When
now
came down
from
-
Macedonia
-
both
Silas
and
-
Timothy
was occupied
with the
word
-
Paul
earnestly testifying
to the
Jews
to be
the
Christ
Jesus
Opposing
however
of them
and
reviling [him]
having shaken out
the
garments
he said
to
them
The
blood
of You
[be] upon
the
head
of you
clean
I [am]
From
-
now on
to
the
Gentiles
I will go
And
having departed
from there
he came
to [the]
house
of a certain one
named
Titius
Justus
worshiping
-
God
of whom
the
house
was
adjoining
the
synagogue
Crispus
now
the
ruler of the synagogue
believed
in the
Lord
with
all
the
household
of him
And
many
of the
Corinthians
hearing
believed
and
were baptized
Said
now
the
Lord
in [the]
night
through
a vision
-
to Paul
Not
fear
but
continue speaking
and
not
be silent
because
I
am
with
you
and
no one
will lay a hand on
you
-
to harm
you
because
people
there are
to me
many
in
the
city
this
He remained
now
a year
and
months
six
teaching
among
them
the
word
-
of God
Gallio
however
proconsul
being
of
Achaia
rose up against
with one accord
the
Jews
-
Paul
and
led
him
to
the
judgment seat
saying
-
Contrary to
the
law
persuades
this [man]
-
men
to worship
-
God
Being about
now
-
Paul
to open
the
mouth
said
-
Gallio
to
the
Jews
If
indeed
it was
unrighteousness
some
or
crime
wicked
O
Jews
according to
reason
-
I would have endured with
you
if
however
a question
it is
about
a word
and
names
and
law
-
in reference to
your
you will see
[to it] yourselves
a judge
I
of these things
not
resolve
to be
And
he drove
them
from
the
judgment seat
Having seized
then
all [of them]
Sosthenes
the
ruler of the synagogue
they began to beat [him]
before
the
judgment seat
And
nothing
about these things
-
to Gallio
it mattered
-
Now
Paul
more
having remained
days
many
the
brothers
having taken leave of
sailed away
to
-
Syria
and
with
him
Priscilla
and
Aquila
having shaved
in
Cenchrea
the
head
he had
for
a vow
They came
now
to
Ephesus
and them
left
there
He himself
then
having entered
into
the
synagogue
he reasoned
with the
Jews
Asking [him]
now
of them
for
a longer
time
to remain
not
he did consent
but
having taken leave
and
having said
Again
I will return
to
you
-
God
willing
he sailed
from
-
Ephesus
and
having landed
at
Caesarea
having gone up
and
having greeted
the
church
he went down
to
Antioch
And
having stayed
time
some
he went forth
passing through
successively
the
Galatian
region
and
Phrygia
strengthening
all
the
disciples
A Jew
now
certain
Apollos
named
of Alexandria
-
a native
a man
eloquent
came
to
Ephesus
mighty
being
in
the
Scriptures
He
was
instructed in
the
way
of the
Lord
And
being fervent
-
in spirit
he was speaking
and
was teaching
earnestly
the things
concerning
-
Jesus
knowing
only
the
baptism
of John
He
then
began
to speak boldly
in
the
synagogue
Having heard
however
him
Priscilla
and
Aquila
they took to [them]
him
and
more accurately
to him
expounded
the
way
of
God
Resolving
then
he
to pass through
into
-
Achaia
having encouraged [him]
the
brothers
wrote
to the
disciples
to welcome
him
who
having arrived
helped
greatly
those
having believed
through
-
grace
Powerfully
for
the
Jews
he was refuting
publicly
showing
by
the
Scriptures
to be
the
Christ
Jesus
It came to pass
now
while
-
-
Apollos
was
in
Corinth
Paul
having passed through
the
upper
parts
to come
to
Ephesus
and
having found
certain
disciples
he said
also
to
them
If
[the] Spirit
Holy
did you receive
having believed
-
And [they said]
to
him
But
not even
that [a]
Spirit
Holy
there is
did we hear
He said
then
Into
what
then
were you baptized
-
And
they said
Into
-
John's
baptism
Said
then
Paul
John
baptized
a baptism
of repentance
the
people
telling
in
the [One]
coming
after
him
that
they should believe
that
is
in
-
Jesus
Having heard
then
they were baptized
in
the
name
of the
Lord
Jesus
And
having laid
on them
-
Paul
hands
came
the
Spirit
-
Holy
upon
them
they were speaking
then
in tongues
and
prophesying
There were
then
the
in all
men
about
twelve
Having entered
then
into
the
synagogue
he was speaking boldly
for
months
three
reasoning
and
persuading
concerning
the
kingdom
-
of God
When
however
some
were hardened
and
were disbelieving
speaking evil of
the
Way
before
the
multitude
having departed
from
them
he took separately
the
disciples
every
day
reasoning
in
the
lecture hall
of Tyrannus
This
then
continued
for
years
two
so that
all
those
inhabiting
-
Asia
heard
the
word
of the
Lord
Jews
both
and
Greeks
Miracles
then
not
-
being ordinary
-
God
was performing
by
the
hands
of Paul
so that
even
to
the
ailing
were brought
from
the
skin
of him
handkerchiefs
or
aprons
and
departed
from
them
the
diseases
the
also
spirits
-
evil
left
Attempted
now
some of
also
of the
itinerant
Jews
exorcists
to invoke
over
those
having
-
spirits
-
evil
the
name
of the
Lord
Jesus
saying
I adjure
you
[by]
Jesus
whom
Paul
proclaims
They were
now
certain
of Sceva
a Jew
a high priest
seven
sons
this
were doing
Answering
however
the
spirit
-
evil
said
to them
-
Jesus
I know
and
-
Paul
I am acquainted with
you
however
who
are you
And
having leapt
the
man
on
them
in
whom
was
the
spirit
-
evil
having overpowered
them all
he prevailed
against
them
so that
naked
and
wounded
they fled
out of
the
house
that
This
now
became
known
to all
Jews
both
and
Greeks
those
inhabiting
-
Ephesus
and
fell
fear
upon
all
them
and
was being magnified
the
name
of the
Lord
Jesus
Many
then
of those
having believed
were coming
confessing
and
declaring
the
deeds
of them
Many
now
of those
the
magic arts
having practiced
having brought
the
books
burned [them]
before
all
And
they counted up
the
prices
of them
and
found [it]
of silverlings
myriads
five
Thus
with
might
of the
Lord
the
word
continued to increase
and
prevail
After
now
were fulfilled
these things
purposed
-
Paul
in
the
Spirit
having passed through
-
Macedonia
and
Achaia
to go
to
Jerusalem
having said
-
After
-
having been
my
there
it behooves
me
also
Rome
to see
Having sent
then
into
-
Macedonia
two
of those
ministering
to him
Timothy
and
Erastus
he
remained
for a time
in
-
Asia
Arose
now
at
the
time
same
a disturbance
not
small
concerning
the
Way
Demetrius
for
a certain [man]
named
a silversmith
making
shrines
silver
of Artemis
was bringing
to the
craftsmen
no
little
business
whom
having brought together
also
the
in
such
things
workmen
he said
Men
you know
that
from
this
-
business
the
wealth
of us
is
And
you see
and
hear
that
not
only
in Ephesus
but
almost
all
-
of Asia
-
Paul
this
having persuaded [them]
has turned away
a great many
people
saying
that
not
they are
gods
-
by
hands
being made
Not
only
but
this
is endangered
to us
the
business
into
disrepute
to come
but
also
the
of the
great
goddess
Artemis
temple
for
nothing
to be reckoned
to be
and
also
deposed
the
majesty
of her
whom
all
-
Asia
and
the
world
worship
Having heard
then
and
having become
full
of rage
they were crying out
saying
Great [is]
-
Artemis
of [the] Ephesians
And
was filled
the
city
whole
with confusion
they rushed
and
with one accord
to
the
theatre
having dragged off
Gaius
and
Aristarchus
Macedonians
fellow travelers
of Paul
Of Paul
however
intending
to go in
to
the
people
not
would allow
him
the
disciples
Some
then
also
of the
Asiarchs
being
to him
friends
having sent
to
him
were urging [him]
not
to venture
himself
into
the
theatre
Others
indeed
therefore
some
thing
were crying out
was
for
the
assembly
confused
and
-
most
not
did know
for what
cause
they were assembled
Out of
now
the
crowd
to explain himself
Alexander
having thrust forward
him
the
Jews
-
And
Alexander
having motioned with
the
hand
was wanting
to make a defense
to the
people
Having recognized
however
that
a Jew
he is
a cry
there was
one
from
all
about
ongoing
hours
two
crying out
Great [is]
-
Artemis
of [the] Ephesians
Having calmed
then
the
town clerk
the
crowd
he says
Men
Ephesians
what
for
is there
man
who
not
knows
the
of [the] Ephesians
city
temple-keeper
as being
of the
great
Artemis
and
of that
fallen from the sky
Undeniable
therefore
being
these things
necessary
it is
for you
calm
to be
and
nothing
rash
to do
You brought
for
the
men
these
neither
temple plunderers
nor
blaspheming
the
goddess
of us
If
indeed
therefore
Demetrius
and
the
with
him
craftsmen
have
against
anyone
a matter
courts
are conducted
and
proconsuls
there are
let them accuse
one another
If
however
anything
beyond this
you inquire
in
the
lawful
assembly
it will be solved
And
for
we are in danger of
being accused
of insurrection
in regard to
-
this day
not one
cause
there existing
concerning
which
not
we will be able
to give
a reason
for
the
commotion
this
And
these things
having said
he dismissed
the
assembly
After
now
-
had ceased
the
uproar
having called to [him]
-
Paul
the
disciples
and
having encouraged
having said farewell
he departed
to go
to
Macedonia
Having passed through
then
the
districts
those
and
having exhorted
them
with talk
much
he came
to
-
Greece
Having continued
then
months
three
having been made
a plot
against him
by
the
Jews
he being about
to sail
into
-
Syria
arose
a purpose
-
to return
through
Macedonia
Was accompanied by
then
he
Sopater
Pyrrhus
a Berean
of the Thessalonians
now
Aristarchus
and
Secundus
and
Gaius
of Derbe
and
Timothy
[the] Asians
now
Tychicus
and
Trophimus
These
also
having gone ahead
waited for
us
in
Troas
We
then
sailed away
after
the
days
of the
Unleavened Bread
from
Philippi
and
we came
to
them
at
-
Troas
within
days
five
where
we stayed
days
seven
In
then
the
first [day]
of the
week
having come together
we
to break
bread
-
Paul
talked
to them
about
to depart
on the
next day
he continued
then
the
talk
until
midnight
There were
now
lamps
many
in
the
upper room
where
we were
assembled
Was sitting
then
a certain
young man
named
Eutychus
by
the
window
overpowered
by sleep
deep
as talked
-
Paul
on
longer
having been overpowered
by
the
sleep
he fell
from
the
third story
down
and
was picked up
dead
Having descended
however
-
Paul
fell upon
him
and
having embraced [him]
said
Not
be alarmed
the
for
life
of him
in
him
is
Having gone up
then
and
having broken
the
bread
and
having eaten
for
long
and
having talked
until
daybreak
so
he departed
They brought
then
the
boy
alive
and
were comforted
not
a little
We
however
having gone ahead
to
the
ship
sailed
to
-
Assos
there
being about
to take in
-
Paul
Thus
for
having arranged
he was
readying
himself
to go on foot
When
now
he met with
us
at
-
Assos
having taken in
him
we came
to
Mitylene
And from there
having sailed away
on the
following [day]
we arrived
opposite
Chios
-
then
the next [day]
we arrived
at
Samos
the
now
following [day]
we came
to
Miletus
Had decided
for
-
Paul
to sail by
-
Ephesus
so that
not
it might come upon
to him
to spend time
in
-
Asia
he was hastened
for
if
possible
it was
for him
on the
day
-
of Pentecost
to be
in
Jerusalem
From
then
-
Miletus
having sent
to
Ephesus
he called for
the
elders
of the
church
When
then
they had come
to
him
he said
to them
You
know
from
the first
day
on
which
I arrived
in
-
Asia
how
with
you
the
whole
time
I was
serving
the
Lord
with
all
humility
and
tears
and
trials
-
having befallen
me
in
the
plots
of the
Jews
how
nothing
I did shrink back
of that
being profitable
-
not
to declare
to you
and
to teach
you
publicly
and
from
house to house
earnestly testifying
to the Jewish
both
and
to Greeks
-
in
God
repentance
and
faith
in
the
Lord
of us
Jesus
And
now
behold
bound
I
in the
Spirit
go
to
Jerusalem
what
in
it
will happen
to me
not
knowing
except
that
the
Spirit
-
Holy
in every
city
fully testifies
to me
saying
that
chains
and
tribulations
me
await
But
not any
account
I make
my
life
dear
to myself
so as
to finish
the
course
of me
and
the
ministry
that
I received
from
the
Lord
Jesus
to testify fully
the
gospel
of the
grace
-
of God
And
now
behold
I
know
that
no more
you will see
the
face
of me
you
all
among
whom
I have gone about
proclaiming
the
kingdom
Therefore
I testify
to you
in
-
this
day
that
innocent
I [am]
of
the
blood
of all
not
for
I shrunk back
-
not
from declaring
all
the
counsel
-
of God
to you
Take heed
to yourselves
and
to all
the
flock
among
which
you
the
Spirit
-
Holy
has set
overseers
to shepherd
the
church
-
of God
which
He purchased
with
-
blood
the
own
I
know
that
will come in
after
the
departure
of me
wolves
grievous
among
you
not
sparing
the
flock
and
out from
your own
selves
will rise up
men
speaking
perverse things
-
to draw away
-
disciples
after
them
Therefore
stay awake
remembering
that
three years
night
and
day
not
I ceased
with
tears
admonishing
one
each
And
-
now
I commit
you
to
God
and
to the
word
of the
grace
of Him
-
being able
to build up
and
to give
you
an inheritance
among
those
having been sanctified
all
Silver
or
gold
or
clothing
of no one
I coveted
You yourselves
know
that
the
needs
of me
and
to those
being
with
me
ministered to
the
hands
these
In everything
I showed
you
that
by thus
straining
it behooves [us]
to aid
those
being weak
to remember
and also
the
words
of the
Lord
Jesus
how
He Himself
said
Blessed
it is
more
to give
than
to receive
And
these things
having said
having bowed
the
knee
of him
with
all
them
he prayed
Much
then
weeping
there was
among all
and
having fallen
upon
the
neck
-
of Paul
they were kissing
him
sorrowing
especially
over
the
word
that
he had spoken
that
no more
they are about
the
face
of him
to see
They accompanied
then
him
to
the
ship
After
then
it happened
sailing
our
having drawn away
from
them
having run directly
we came
to
-
Cos
-
and
the next [day]
to
-
Rhodes
and from there
to
Patara
And
having found
a boat
passing over
into
Phoenicia
having gone on board
we set sail
Having sighted
then
-
Cyprus
and
having left
it
on the left
we kept sailing
to
Syria
and
landed
at
Tyre
There
for
the
ship
was
unloading
the
cargo
Having sought out
then
the
disciples
we remained
there
days
seven
who
-
to Paul
kept telling
through
the
Spirit
not
to go up
to
Jerusalem
When
then
it happened that
had completed
we
the
days
having set out
we journeyed
accompanying
us
all
with
wives
and
children
as far as
outside
the
city
And
having bowed
the
knees
on
the
shore
having prayed
having said farewell
to one another
then
we went up
into
the
boat
they
then
returned
to
the
own
We
then
the
voyage
having completed
from
Tyre
came down
to
Ptolemais
and
having greeted
the
brothers
we stayed
day
one
with
them
On the
now
next day
having gone forth
we came
to
Caesarea
and
having entered
into
the
house
of Philip
the
evangelist
being
of
the
seven
we stayed
with
him
With this [man]
now
there were
daughters
four
virgins
prophesying
Remaining
now
days
many
came down
a certain one
from
-
Judea
a prophet
named
Agabus
and
having come
to
us
and
having taken
the
belt
-
of Paul
having bound
of himself
the
feet
and
the
hands
he said
Thus
says
the
Spirit
-
Holy
The
man
of whom
is
the
belt
this
in this way
will bind
in
Jerusalem
the
Jews
and
will deliver [him]
into
[the] hands
of [the] Gentiles
When
then
we had heard
these things
began begging
we
both
and
those
of that place
-
not
to go up
him
to
Jerusalem
Then
answered
-
Paul
What
are you doing
weeping
and
breaking
my
-
heart
I
for
not
only
to be bound
but
also
to die
at
Jerusalem
readiness
have
for
the
name
of the
Lord
Jesus
Not
being persuaded
then
of him
we were silent
having said
Of the
Lord
the
will
be done
After
now
the
days
these
having packed the baggage
we started on our way up
to
Jerusalem
Went
then
also [some]
of the
disciples
from
Caesarea
with
us
bringing [one]
with
whom
we would lodge
Mnason
a certain
Cypriot
an early
disciple
Having arrived
now
we
at
Jerusalem
gladly
received
us
the
brothers
On the
now
following [day]
went in
-
Paul
with
us
unto
James
all
and
arrived
the
elders
And
having greeted
them
he began to relate
by
one
each
the things
had done
-
God
among
the
Gentiles
through
the
ministry
of him
Those
then
having heard
began glorifying
-
God
They said
then
to him
You see
brother
how many
myriads
there are
among
the
Jews
-
having believed
and
all
zealous ones
for the
law
are
They have been informed
now
about
you
that
apostasy
you teach
from
Moses
those
among
the
Gentiles
all
Jews
telling
not
to circumcise
them
the
children
nor
in the
customs
to walk
What
then
is it
Certainly
they will hear
that
you have come
This
therefore
do you
what
to you
we say
There are
with us
men
four
a vow
having
on
themselves
These [men]
having taken
be purified
with
them
and
bear expense
for
them
so that
they will shave
the
head
and
will know
all
that
of which
they have been informed
about
you
nothing
is
but
you walk orderly
also
yourself
keeping
the
law
Concerning
now
those
having believed
of the Gentiles
we
wrote
having adjudged
to keep from
them
the things
both
sacrificed to idols
and
blood
and
what is strangled
and
sexual immorality
Then
-
Paul
having taken
the
men
on the
following
day
with
them
having been purified
entered
into
the
temple
declaring
the
fulfillment
of the
days
of the
purification
until
that
was offered
for
one
each
of them
the
sacrifice
When
now
were about
the
seven
days
to be completed
the
from
-
Asia
Jews
having seen
him
in
the
temple
began stirring up
all
the
crowd
and
laid
upon
him
the
hands
crying out
Men
Israelites
help
This
is
the
man
who
against
the
people
and
the
law
and
the
place
this
all those
everywhere
teaching
besides
and
also
Greeks
he has brought
into
the
temple
and
defiled
the
holy
place
this
It was they
for
having previously seen
Trophimus
the
Ephesian
in
the
city
with
him
whom
they were supposing
that
into
the
temple
had brought
-
Paul
Was thrown into commotion
also
the
city
whole
and
there was
a rushing together
of the
people
And
having laid hold
-
of Paul
they dragged
him
outside
the
temple
and
immediately
were shut
the
doors
Of them seeking
then
him
to kill
there came
a report
to the
commander
of the
cohort
that
all
was in an uproar
Jerusalem
who
at once
having taken with [him]
soldiers
and
centurions
ran down
upon
them
-
And
having seen
the
commander
and
the
soldiers
they stopped
beating
-
Paul
Then
having drawn near
the
commander
laid hold
of him
and
commanded [him]
to be bound
with chains
two
and
began inquiring
who
he might be
and
what
it is
he has been doing
Others
however
another [or]
one thing
were crying out
in
the
crowd
Not
being able
now
he
to know
the
facts
on account of
the
uproar
he ordered
to be brought
him
into
the
barracks
When
now
he came
to
the
stairs
it happened that
was carried
he
by
the
soldiers
because of
the
violence
of the
crowd
Were following
for
the
multitude
of the
people
crying out
Away with
him
Being about
then
to be brought
into
the
barracks
-
Paul
says
to the
commander
If
is it permitted
to me
to say
something
to
you
-
Then
he was saying
Greek
do you know
Not
then
you
are
the
Egyptian
-
before
these
the
days
having led a revolt
and
having led out
into
the
wilderness
the
four thousand
men
of the
Assassins
Said
however
-
Paul
I
a man
indeed
am
a Jew
of Tarsus
-
of Cilicia
not [of an]
insignificant
city
a citizen
I implore
now
you
allow
me
to speak
to
the
people
Having allowed [him]
then
he
-
Paul
having stood
on
the
stairs
made a sign
with the
hand
to the
people
great
then
silence
having taken place
he spoke to [them]
in the
Hebrew
language
saying
Men
brothers
and
fathers
hear
of me
the
to
you
now
defense
Having heard
then
that
in the
Hebrew
language
he was addressing
them
even more
they became
quiet
And
he says
I
am
a man
a Jew
born
in
Tarsus
-
of Cilicia
brought up
now
in
the
city
this
at
the
feet
of Gamaliel
having been instructed
according to [the]
exactness
of the
of our Fathers
law
a zealous one
being
-
for God
even as
all
you
are
this day
who
this
-
Way
persecuted
as far as
death
binding
and
betraying
to
prisons
men
both
and
women
as
also
the
high priest
bears witness
to me
and
all
the
elderhood
from
whom
also
letters
having received
to
the
brothers
to
Damascus
I was on my way
to bring
also
those
there
being
bound
to
Jerusalem
in order that
they might be punished
It happened
however
to me
journeying
and
drawing near
-
to Damascus
about
noon
suddenly
out of
-
heaven
shone
a light
great
around
me
I fell
then
to
the
ground
and
heard
a voice
saying
to me
Saul
Saul
why
Me
persecute you
I
then
answered
Who
are You
Lord
He said
then
to
me
I
am
Jesus
of
Nazareth
whom
you
are persecuting
Those
then
with
me
being
the
indeed
light
beheld
the
however
voice
not
did they hear
of the [One]
speaking
to me
I said
then
What
shall I do
Lord
-
And
the Lord
said
to
me
Having risen up
go
to
Damascus
and there
you
it will be told
concerning
all things
that
it has been appointed
you
to do
While
now
not
I could see
from
the
brightness
of the
light
that
being led by the hand
by
those
being with
me
I came
to
Damascus
Ananias
then
certain
a man
devout
according to
the
law
borne witness to
by
all
the
dwelling [there]
Jews
having come
to
me
and
having stood by [me]
said
to me
Saul
brother
receive your sight
And I
the same
-
hour
looked up
at
him
-
And
he said
The
God
of the
fathers
of us
has appointed
you
to know
the
will
of Him
and
to see
the
Righteous One
and
to hear
[the] voice
out of
the
mouth
of Him
For
you will be
a witness
for Him
to
all
men
of what
you have seen
and
heard
And
now
why
delay you
Having arisen
be baptized
and
wash away
the
sins
of you
calling on
the
name
of Him
It happened
then
to me
having returned
to
Jerusalem
and
praying
of my
in
the
temple
fell
I
into
a trance
and
saw
Him
saying
to me
Make haste
and
go away
with
speed
out of
Jerusalem
because
not
they will receive
your
testimony
about
Me
And I
said
Lord
they themselves
know
that
I
was
imprisoning
and
beating
in each
of those
synagogues
those
believing
on
You
And
when
was poured out
the
blood
of Stephen
the
witness
of You
also
I myself
was
standing by
and
consenting
and
watching over
the
garments
of those
killing
him
And
He said
to
me
Go
for
I
to
[the] Gentiles
far away
will send
you
They were listening
now
to him
until
this
-
word
and
they lifted up
the
voice
of them
saying
Away with
from
the
earth
the
such
Not
for
it is fit
he
to live
Were crying out
then
they
and
casting off
the
garments
and
dust
throwing
into
the
air
Ordered
the
commander
to be brought
him
into
the
barracks
having directed
by flogging
to be examined
him
so that
he might know
for
what
cause
like this
they were crying out
against him
As
however
he stretched forward
him
with the
straps
said
to
the
standing by
centurion
-
Paul
If
a man
a Roman
and
uncondemned
it is lawful
to you
to flog
Having heard
then
the
centurion
having gone
to the
commander
he reported [it]
saying
What
are you going
to do
The
for
man
this
a Roman
is
Having come near
then
the
commander
said
to him
Tell
me
you
a Roman
are
-
And
he was saying
Yes
Answered
then
the
commander
I
with a great
sum
the
citizenship
this
bought
-
But
Paul
was saying
I
however
even
was born [so]
Immediately
therefore
departed
from
him
those
being about
him
to examine
and
the
commander
also
was afraid
having ascertained
that
a Roman
he is
and
because
him
he had
bound
On the
now
next day
desiring
to know
-
for certain
-
why
he is accused
by
the
Jews
he unbound
him
and
commanded
to assemble
the
chief priests
and
all
the
council
And
having brought down
-
Paul
he set [him]
among
them
Having looked intently
then
-
Paul
Council
he said
Men
brothers
I
in all
conscience
good
have lived as a citizen
-
to God
unto
this
-
day

-
Then
the high priest
Ananias
commanded
those
standing by
him
to strike
of him
the
mouth
Then
-
Paul
to
him
said
To strike
you
is about
-
God
wall
whitewashed
And
you
do you sit
judging
me
according to
the
law
and
violating law
command
me
to be struck
Those who
now
stood by
said
The
high priest
-
of God
do you insult
Was saying
then
-
Paul
Not
I was aware
brothers
that
he is
high priest
it has been written
for
-
[The] ruler
of the
people
of you
not
you shall speak
evil [of]
Having known
then
-
Paul
that
the
one
part
consists
of Sadducees
-
but
the other
of Pharisees
he began crying out
in
the
Council
Men
brothers
I
a Pharisee
am
[the] son
of a Pharisee
concerning
[the] hope
and
resurrection
of [the] dead
am judged
This
then
of him
saying
arose
a dissension
between the
Pharisees
and
Sadducees
and
was divided
the
crowd
Sadducees
for
say
not
there to be
resurrection
nor
angel
nor
spirit
Pharisees
however
confess
-
both
Arose
then
a clamor
great
and
having risen up
some
of the
scribes
of the
party
of the
Pharisees
they were contending
saying
Nothing
evil
we find
in
the
man
this
What if
now
a spirit
has spoken
to him
or
an angel
Great
then
arising
dissension
having feared
the
commander
lest
should be torn to pieces
-
Paul
by
them
he commanded
the
troop
having gone down
to take by force
him
from
midst
of them
to bring [him]
then
into
the
barracks
-
But
the following
night
having stood by
him
the
Lord
said
Take courage
as
for
you have fully testified
-
about
Me
at
Jerusalem
so
you
it behooves
also
in
Rome
to testify
When it was
then
day
having made
a conspiracy
the
Jews
put under an oath
themselves
declaring
neither
to eat
nor
to drink
until
that
they should kill
-
Paul
There were
now
more than
forty
-
this
-
plot
having made
who
having come
to the
chief priests
and
the
elders
said
With an oath
we have bound
ourselves
nothing
to eat
until
that
we should kill
-
Paul
Now
therefore
you
make a report
to the
commander
along with
the
Council
so that
he might bring down
him
to
you
as
being about
to examine
more earnestly
the things
about
him
we
then
before
-
drawing near
his
ready
are
-
to kill
him
Having heard
however
the
son
of the
sister
of Paul
of the
ambush
having come near
and
having entered
into
the
barracks
he reported [it]
-
to Paul
Having called to [him]
then
-
Paul
one
of the
centurions
he was saying
The
young man
this
take
to
the
commander
he has
for
to report
something
to him
The [one]
indeed
therefore
having taken
him
brought [him]
to
the
commander
and
he says
The
prisoner
Paul
having called to
me
asked [me]
this
-
young man
to lead
to
you
having
something
to say
to you
Having taken hold
then
the
hand
of him
the
commander
and
having withdrawn
in
private
he began to inquire
What
is it
that
you have
to report
to me
He said
then
-
The
Jews
have agreed
-
to ask
you
that
tomorrow
-
Paul
you might bring down
into
the
Council
as
being about
something
more earnestly
to inquire
about
him
You
therefore
not
should be persuaded
by them
Lie in wait
indeed
for him
of
them
men
more than
forty
who
have put under an oath
themselves
neither
to eat
nor
to drink
until
that
they have killed
him
and
now
they are
ready
awaiting
the
from
you
promise
-
Indeed
therefore
the commander
dismissed
the
young man
having instructed [him]
No one
tell
that
these things
you have reported
to
me
And
having called to [him]
certain
two
of the
centurions
he said
Prepare
soldiers
two hundred
so that
they might go
as far as
Caesarea
and
horsemen
seventy
and
spearmen
two hundred
for
the third
hour
of the
night
Mounts
then
provide
so that
having set upon [them]
-
Paul
they might bring [him] safely
to
Felix
the
governor
having written
a letter
having
the
form
this
Claudius
Lysias
To the
most excellent
governor
Felix
Greetings
The
man
this
having been seized
by
the
Jews
and
being about
to be killed
by
them
having come up
with
the
troop
I rescued [him]
having learned
that
a Roman
he is
Resolving
then
to know
the
charge
on account of
which
they were accusing
him
I brought [him] down
to
the
council
of them
whom
I found
being accused
concerning
questions
of the
law
of them
no
however
worthy
of death
or
of chains
having
accusation
It having been disclosed
then
to me
of a plot that
against
the
man
would be
at once
I sent [him]
to
you
having instructed
also
the
accusers
to speak
against
him
before
you
-
Indeed
therefore
the soldiers
according to
that
having been ordered
them
having taken
-
Paul
brought [him]
by
night
to
-
Antipatris
On the
now
next day
having allowed
the
horsemen
to go
with
him
they returned
to
the
barracks
who
having entered
into
-
Caesarea
and
having delivered
the
letter
to the
governor
presented
also
-
Paul
to him
Having read [it]
then
and
having asked
from
what
province
he is
and
having learned
that
from
Cilicia [he is]
I will hear fully
you
he was saying
when
also
the
accusers
of you
may have arrived
having commanded
in
the
Praetorium
-
of Herod
to be guarded
him
After
then
five
days
came down
the
high priest
Ananias
with
elders
some
and
an orator
Tertullus
certain
who
made a representation
to the
governor
against
-
Paul
Having been called
then
of him
began
to accuse
-
Tertullus
saying
Great
peace
we are attaining
through
you
and
excellent measures
are being done
to the
nation
this
through
-
your
foresight
in every way
both
and
everywhere
we gladly accept [it]
most excellent
Felix
with
all
thankfulness
In order that
however
not
to
any longer
you
I should be a hindrance
I implore
to hear
you
us
briefly
[in]
your
kindness
Having found
for
the
man
this
a pest
and
stirring
insurrection
among all
the
Jews
-
in
the
world
a leader
then
of the
of the
Nazarenes
sect
who
even
the
temple
attempted
to profane
whom
also
we seized
From
him
you will be able
yourself
having examined [him]
concerning
all
these things
to know
of which
we
accuse
him
Agreed
then
also
the
Jews
declaring
these things
so
to be
Answered
then
-
Paul
having made a sign
to him
the
governor
to speak
For
many
years
as being
you
judge
to
nation
this
knowing
cheerfully
to the things
concerning
myself
I make a defense
Being able
you
to know
that
not
more than
there are
to me
days
twelve
from
which
I went up
to worship
in
Jerusalem
And
neither
in
the
temple
did they find
me
with
anyone
reasoning
or
a tumultuous gathering
making
of a crowd
nor
in
the
synagogues
nor
in
the
city
Nor
to prove
are they able
to you
concerning
[the things] of which
now
they accuse
me
I confess
however
this
to you
that
according to
the
Way
which
they call
a sect
so
I serve
the
of our fathers
God
believing
all things
-
throughout
the
law
and
that
in
the
Prophets
have been written
a hope
having
in
-
God
which
also
they
themselves
await
[that] a resurrection
there is about
to be
of [the] just
both
and
of [the] unjust
In
this
also
I myself
strive
without offense
a conscience
to have
toward
-
God
and
-
men
through
everything
After
years
now
many
alms
to bring
to
the
nation
of me
I arrived
and
offerings
during
which
they found
me
purified
in
the
temple
not
with
a crowd
nor
in
tumult
Some
however [are]
from
-
Asia
Jews
who
ought
before
you
to appear
and
to make accusation
if
anything
they may have
against
me
Otherwise
themselves
it
let them say
any
they found
unrighteousness
having stood
in me
before
the
Council
[other] than
concerning
one
this
voice
which
I cried out
among
them
standing
-
Concerning
[the] resurrection
of [the] dead
I
am judged
this day
by
you
Put off
however
them
-
Felix
more precisely
having knowledge of
the things
concerning
the
Way
having said
When
Lysias
the
commander
might have come down
I will examine
the things
as to
you
having commanded
the
centurion
to keep
him
to [let him] have
then
ease
and
not
to forbid
the
own
of him
to minister
to him
After
then
days
some
having arrived
-
Felix
with
Drusilla
the
own
wife
being
a Jewess
he sent for
-
Paul
and
heard
him
concerning
the
in
Christ
Jesus
faith
Reasoning
then
he
concerning
righteousness
and
self-control
and
the
judgment
-
coming
frightened
having become
-
Felix
answered
For the
present
being
go away
opportunity
then
having found
I will call for
you
At the same time
also
he is hoping
that
riches
will be given
him
by
-
Paul
Therefore
also
often
him
sending for
he was talking
with him
Two years
however
having been completed
received [as]
successor
-
Felix
Porcius
Festus
wishing
then
favor
to acquire for himself
with the
Jews
-
Felix
left
-
Paul
imprisoned
Festus
therefore
having arrived in
the
province
after
three
days
he went up
to
Jerusalem
from
Caesarea
Made a presentation before
then
him
the
chief priests
and
the
chiefs
of the
Jews
against
-
Paul
and
they were begging
him
asking
a favor
against
him
that
he would summon
him
to
Jerusalem
an ambush
forming
to kill
him
on
the
way
-
Indeed
therefore
Festus
answered that
is to be kept
-
Paul
in
Caesarea
he himself
now
is about
in
quickness
to set out
Those
therefore
among
you
he says
[those] in power
having gone down too
if
anything
there is
in
the
man
wrong
let them accuse
him
Having spent
then
with
them
days
not
more than
eight
or
ten
having gone down
to
Caesarea
on the
next day
having sat
on
the
judgment seat
he commanded
-
Paul
to be brought
Having arrived
then
he
stood around
him
the
from
Jerusalem
having come down
Jews
many
and
weighty
charges
bringing
which
not
they were able
to prove
-
Paul
made his defense
-
Neither
against
the
law
of the
Jews
nor
against
the
temple
nor
against
Caesar
[in] anything
have I sinned
-
Festus
however
wishing
on the
Jews
a favor
to lay
answering
-
Paul
said
Are you willing
to
Jerusalem
having gone up
there
concerning
these things
to be judged
before
me
Said
then
-
Paul
Standing
before
the
judgment seat
of Caesar
I am
where
me
it behooves
to be judged
To [the] Jews
nothing
I have done wrong
as
also
you
very well
know
If
indeed
therefore
I do wrong
and
worthy
of death
have done
anything
not
I do refuse
-
to die
If
however
nothing
there is
of which
they
[can] accuse
me
no one
me
can
to them
give up
To Caesar
I appeal
Then
-
Festus
having conferred
with
the
Council
answered
To Caesar
You have appealed
to
Caesar
you will go
Days
now
having passed
some
Agrippa
the
king
and
Bernice
came down
to
Caesarea
greeting
-
Festus
As
now
many
days
they stayed
there
-
Festus
the
king
laid before
the things
relating to
-
Paul
saying
A man
certain
there is
left
by
Felix
[as] a prisoner
concerning
whom
having been
my
in
Jerusalem
made a presentation
the
chief priests
and
the
elders
of the
Jews
asking
against
him
judgment
to
whom
I answered
that
not
it is
[the] custom
with Romans
to give up
any
man
before
that
the [one]
being accused
to
face
may have [it]
the
accusers
[the] opportunity
and
of defense
he may have
concerning
the
accusation
Having come together
therefore
here
delay
no
having made
the
next [day]
having sat
on
the
judgment seat
I commanded
to be brought
the
man
concerning
whom
having stood up
the
accusers
no
charge
were bringing
of which
I
was expecting
crimes
Questions
however
certain
concerning
the
own
religion
they had
against
him
and
concerning
a certain
Jesus
having been dead
whom
was affirming
-
Paul
to be alive
Being perplexed
now
I
-
concerning
this
inquiry
was asking
if
he was willing
to go
to
Jerusalem
and there
to be judged
concerning
these things
-
But
of Paul
having appealed for
to be kept
himself
for
the
-
Emperor's
decision
I commanded
to be kept
him
until
that
I might send
him
to
Caesar
Agrippa
then
[said] to
-
Festus
I have been wanting
also
myself
the
man
to hear
Tomorrow
he says
you will hear
him
On the
therefore
next day
having come
-
Agrippa
and
-
Bernice
with
great
pomp
and
having entered
into
the
audience hall
with
both
[the] commanders
and
men
-
in
prominence
in the
city
and
having commanded
-
Festus
was brought in
-
Paul
And
says
-
Festus
Agrippa
King
and
all
the
being present with
us
men
you see
this one
concerning
whom
all
the
multitude
of the
Jews
pleaded
with me
in
both
Jerusalem
and
here
crying out [that]
not
he ought
of him
to live
no longer
I
however
having understood
nothing
worthy
him
of death
to have done
himself
and
of this one
having appealed to
the
Emperor
I determined
to send [him]
concerning
whom
definite
anything
to write
to
[my] lord
not
I have
Therefore
I have brought
him
before
you all
and
especially
before
you
King
Agrippa
so that
the
examination
having taken place
I might have
something
to write
Absurd
for
to me
it seems
[in] sending
a prisoner
not
also
the
against
him
charges
to specify
Agrippa
then
to
-
Paul
was saying
It is permitted
you
for
yourself
to speak
Then
-
Paul
having stretched out
the
hand
began his defense
Concerning
all
of which
I am accused
by
[the] Jews
King
Agrippa
I esteem
myself
fortunate
before
you
being about
today
to defend myself
Especially
acquainted
being
you
with all
the
of
[the] Jews
customs
and
also
controversies
therefore
I implore [you]
patiently
to hear
me
The
indeed
then
manner of life
of me
from
youth
-
from [its]
beginning
having been
among
the
nation
of me
in
also
Jerusalem
know
all
Jews
knowing
me
from the first
if
they would be willing
to testify
that
according to
the
strictest
sect
-
of our
religion
I lived [as]
a Pharisee
And
now
for [the]
hope
of the
to
the
fathers
of us
promise
having been made
by
-
God
I stand
being judged
to
which
the
twelve tribes
of us
in
earnestness
night
and
day
serving
hope
to attain
concerning
which
hope
I am accused
by
the Jews
O king
Why
incredible
is it judged
by
you
if
-
God
[the] dead
raises
I
indeed
therefore
thought
in myself
to
the
name
of Jesus
-
of Nazareth
I ought
many things
contrary
to do
which
also
I did
in
Jerusalem
and
many
also
of the
saints
I
in
prisons
locked up
the
from
the
chief priests
authority
having received
being put to death
then
they
I cast against [them]
a vote
And
in
all
the
synagogues
often
punishing
them
I was compelling [them]
to blaspheme
Exceedingly
then
being furious
against them
I kept persecuting [them]
as far as
even
to
-
foreign
cities
during
which
journeying
to
-
Damascus
with
[the] authority
and
commission
of
the
chief priests
day
mid
on
the
road
I saw
O king
from heaven
above
the
brightness
of the
sun
having shone around
me
a light
and
those
with
me
journeying
All
and
having fallen down
of us
to
the
ground
I heard
a voice
saying
to
me
in the
Hebrew
language
Saul
Saul
why
Me
persecute you
[It is] hard
for you
against
[the] goads
to kick
I
then
said
Who
are You
Lord
-
And
the Lord
said
I
am
Jesus
whom
you
are persecuting
But
rise up
and
stand
on
the
feet
of you
for this
purpose
for
I have appeared
to you
to appoint
you
a servant
and
a witness
of that which
both
you have seen
of Me
of the things in which
then
I will appear
to you
delivering
you
out from
the
people
and
from
the
Gentiles
to
whom
I
am sending
you
to open
eyes
of them
that
they may turn
from
darkness
to
light
and
from the
power
-
of Satan
to
-
God
[that]
may receive
they
forgiveness
of sins
and
[an] inheritance
among
those
having been sanctified
by faith
that [is]
in
Me
So then
O king
Agrippa
not
I was
disobedient
to the
heavenly
vision
but
to those
in
Damascus
first
both
and
Jerusalem
all
and
the
region
-
of Judea
and
to the
Gentiles
I kept declaring
to repent
and
to turn
to
-
God
worthy
-
of repentance
works
doing
On account of
these things
me
the Jews
having seized
in
the
temple
they were attempting
to kill
Help
therefore
having obtained
-
from
-
God
unto
the
day
this
I have stood
bearing witness
to small
both
and
to great
nothing
other
saying
than what
both
the
prophets
said
was about
to happen
and
Moses
that
would suffer
the
Christ
as
first
through
resurrection
from [the] dead
light
He is about
to preach
to
both
our people
and
to the
Gentiles
These things
now
of him
saying in his defense
-
Festus
in a loud
-
voice
said
You are insane
Paul
The
great
of you
learning
to
insanity
turns [you]
-
But
Paul
Not
I am insane
says
most excellent
Festus
but
of truth
and
sobriety
words
I utter
Understands
for
concerning
these things
the
king
to
whom
also
using boldness
I speak
Are hidden from
for
him
of these things
not
I am persuaded
none
not
for
is
in
a corner
done
of these things
Believe you
King
Agrippa
the
prophets
I know
that
you believe
-
Then
Agrippa
[said] to
-
Paul
Within
so little
me
do you persuade
a Christian
to become
-
And
Paul [said]
I would wish
-
-
to God
both
in
a little
and
in
much
not
only
you
but
also
all
those
hearing
me
this day
to become
such
as
also
I
am
except
the
chains
these
Rose up
then
the
king
and
the
governor
-
and
Bernice
and
those
sitting with
them
and
having withdrawn
they began speaking
to
one another
saying
-
Nothing
of death
or
of chains
worthy
is doing
the
man
this
Agrippa
then
to
Festus
was saying
Have been released
could
the
man
this
if
not
he had appealed
to Caesar
When
now
was determined
-
sailing
our
to
-
Italy
they delivered
-
both
Paul
and
certain
other
prisoners
to a centurion
named
Julius
of the cohort
of Augustus
Having boarded
then
a ship
of Adramyttium
being about
to sail
to
the
along
-
Asia
places
we set sail
being
with
us
Aristarchus
a Macedonian
of Thessalonica
The
then
next [day]
we landed
at
Sidon
Considerately
then
-
Julius
-
Paul
having treated
allowed [him]
to
his
friends
having gone
care
to receive
And from there
having set sail
we sailed under
-
Cyprus
because of
-
the
winds
being
contrary
-
And
then
-
along
-
Cilicia
and
Pamphylia
having sailed across [the sea]
we came
to
Myra
-
of Lycia
And there
having found
the
centurion
a ship
of Alexandria
sailing
to
-
Italy
he placed
us
into
it
For
many
now
days
sailing slowly
and
with difficulty
having arrived
off
-
Cnidus
not
permitting
us
the
wind
we sailed under
-
Crete
off
Salmone
With difficulty
and
coasting along
it
we came
to
a place
certain
called
Fair
Havens
to which
near
was
[the] city
of Lasea
Much
now
time
having passed
and
being
already
dangerous
the
voyage
because of
-
even
the
Fast
already
being over
was admonishing [them]
-
Paul
saying
to them
Men
I understand
that
with
disaster
and
much
loss
not
only
of the
cargo
and
of the
ship
but
also
the
lives
of us
is about
to be
the
voyage
-
But
the centurion
by the
pilot
and
the
ship owner
rather
was persuaded
than
by the things
by
Paul
spoken
Unsuitable
now
the
harbor
being
to
winter in
the
majority
reached
a decision
to set sail
from there
if
somehow
they might be able
having arrived
at
Phoenix
to winter [there]
a harbor
-
of Crete
looking
toward
[the] southwest
and
toward
[the] northwest
Having blown gently
now
a south wind
having thought
the
purpose
to have obtained
having weighed [anchor]
very near
they began coasting along
-
Crete
After
not
long
however
there came
down
from it
a wind
tempestuous
-
called
the Northeaster
Having been caught
then
the
ship
and
not
being able
to face
to the
wind
having given way
we were driven along
An Island
then
certain
having run under
called
Cauda
we were able
with difficulty
control
to gain
of the
lifeboat
which
having taken up
supports
they began using
undergirding
the
ship
Fearing
then
lest
into
the
sandbars of Syrtis
they should fall
having lowered
the
gear
thus
they were driven along
Violently
now
being storm-tossed
of us
on the
next [day]
a jettison of cargo
they began to make
and
on the
third [day]
with [their] own hands
the
tackle
of the
ship
they cast away
Neither
now
sun
nor
stars
appearing
for
many
days
tempest
and
no
small
lying on [us]
from then on
was abandoned
hope
all
-
being saved
of us
Much
also
time without food
there being
at that time
having stood up
-
Paul
in
midst
of them
he said
It behooved [you]
indeed
O
men
having been obedient
to me
not
to have set sail
from
-
Crete
to have incurred
then
the
disaster
this
and
-
loss
And yet
-
now
I exhort
you
to keep up your courage
loss
for
of life
none
there will be
from among
you
only
of the
ship
Stood by
for
me
this
-
night
-
of God
whose
am
whom
and
I serve
an angel
saying
Not
fear
Paul
Caesar
you
it behooves
to stand before
And
behold
has granted
to you
-
God
all
those
sailing
with
you
Therefore
take courage
men
I believe
for
-
God
that
thus
it will be
according to
the
way
it has been said
to me
Upon
an island
however
certain
it behooves
us
to fall
When
then
the fourteenth
night
had come
being driven about
of us
in
the
Adriatic
toward
[the] middle
of the
night
began sensing
the
sailors
to be drawing near
some
to them
land
And
having taken soundings
they found
fathoms
twenty
A little
then
having gone farther
and
again
having taken soundings
they found
fathoms
fifteen
Fearing
then
lest
somewhere
on
rocky
places
we might fall
out of [the]
stern
having cast
anchors
four
they were praying for
day
to come
Of the
then
sailors
seeking
to flee
out of
the
ship
and
having let down
the
lifeboat
into
the
sea
under pretense
as
from
[the] bow
anchors
being about
to cast out
said
-
Paul
to the
centurion
and
to the
soldiers
If
not
these
remain
in
the
ship
you
to be saved
not
are able
Then
cut away
the
soldiers
the
ropes
of the
lifeboat
and
allowed
her
to fall away
Until
then
that
day
was about
to come
kept urging
-
Paul
all
to partake
of food
saying
The fourteenth
today
[is] day
watching
without eating
you continue
nothing
having taken
Therefore
I exhort
you
to take
food
this
indeed
for
-
of you
preservation
is
not one
for
of you
a hair
of
the
head
will perish
Having said
now
these things
and
having taken
bread
he gave thanks
-
to God
before
all
and
having broken [it]
he began
to eat
Encouraged
then
having been
all
also
themselves
took
food
We were
then
the
altogether
souls
in
the
ship
two hundred
seventy
six
Having been filled
then
with food
they began to lighten
the
ship
casting out
the
wheat
into
the
sea
When
now
day
it was
the
land
not
they did recognize
a bay
however
certain
they noticed
having
a shore
on
which
they determined
if
they should be able
to drive
the
ship
And
the
anchors
having cut away
they left [them]
in
the
sea
at the same time
having loosened
the
ropes
of the
rudders
And
having hoisted
the
foresail
to the
blowing [wind]
they began making
for
the
shore
Having fallen
however
into
a place
between two seas
they ran aground
the
vessel
and
the
indeed
bow
having stuck fast
it remained
immovable
-
and
the stern
was being broken up
by
the
violence
Of the
now
soldiers
[the] plan
was
that
the
prisoners
they should kill
lest
anyone
having swum away
should escape
-
But
the centurion
desiring
to save
-
Paul
hindered
them
of
[the] purpose
he commanded
then
those
being able
to swim
having cast [themselves] off
first
on
the
land
to go out
and
the
rest
some
indeed
on
boards
some
then
on
things
-
from
the
ship
And
thus
it came to pass that
all
were brought safely
to
the
land
And
having been saved
then
we found out
that
Malta
the
island
is called
-
And
the natives
were showing
not [just]
the
ordinary
kindness
to us
Having kindled
for
a fire
they received
all
of us
because of
the
rain
-
coming on
and
because
of the
cold
Having gathered
now
-
Paul
of sticks
a
quantity
and
having laid [them]
on
the
fire
a viper
out from
the
heat
having come
fastened
on the
hand
of him
When
then
saw
the
natives
hanging
the
beast
from
the
hand
of him
to
one another
they began to say
By all means
a murderer
is
the
man
this
whom
having been saved
from
the
sea
-
Justice
to live
not
has permitted
The [one]
indeed
then
having shaken off
the
creature
into
the
fire
he suffered
no
injury
-
But
they were expecting
him
to be about
to become inflamed
or
to fall down
suddenly
dead
A while
great
however
of them
waiting
and
seeing
nothing
amiss
to
him
happening
having changed their opinion
they began declaring
him
to be
a god
In
now
the [parts]
around
the
place
that
were
lands
belonging to the
chief
of the
island
named
Publius
who
having received
us
days
three
hospitably
entertained [us]
It came to pass
then
the
father
-
of Publius
fevers
and
dysentery
oppressed with
was lying
toward
whom
-
Paul
having entered
and
having prayed
having laid
the
hands
on him
healed
him
Of this
then
having taken place
also
the
rest
-
in
the
island
having
infirmities
were coming
and
were healed
who
also
with many
honors
honored
us
and
on setting sail
they laid on [us]
the things
for
the
needs
After
then
three
months
we sailed
in
a ship
having wintered
in
the
island
Alexandrian
with a figurehead of
the Dioscuri
And
having put in
at
Syracuse
we stayed
days
three
from where
having gone around
we arrived
at
Rhegium
And
after
one
day
having come on
a south wind
on the second day
we came
to
Puteoli
where
having found
[some] brothers
we were entreated
with
them
to remain
days
seven
And
so
to
-
Rome
we came
And from there
the
brothers
having heard
the things
concerning
us
came out
to
meet
us
as far as
of Appius
[the] market
and
[the] Three
Taverns
whom
having seen
-
Paul
having given thanks
to
God
took
courage
When
now
we came
to
Rome
was allowed
-
Paul
to stay
by
himself
with
the
guarding
him
soldier
It came to pass
then
after
days
three
called together
he
those
being
of the
Jews
leaders
Having come together
then
of them
he was saying
to
them
I
men
brothers
nothing
against
having done
the
people
or
the
customs
-
of our fathers
a prisoner
from
Jerusalem
was delivered
into
the
hands
of the
Romans
who
having examined
me
were wanting
to let [me] go
on account of
-
not one
cause
of death
existing
in
me
Objecting
however
of the
Jews
I was compelled
to appeal to
Caesar
not
as
the
nation
of me
having
anything
to lay against
For
this
therefore
-
cause
I have called
you
to see
and
to speak to [you]
because of
for
the
hope
-
of Israel
the
chain
this
I have around [me]
-
And
to
him
they said
We
neither
letters
concerning
you
received
from
-
Judea
nor
having arrived
any
of the
brothers
reported
or
said
anything
concerning
you
evil
We deem it worthy
however
from
you
to hear
what
you think
concerning
truly
for
the
sect
this
known
to us
it is
that
everywhere
it is spoken against
Having appointed
then
him
a day
came
to
him
to
the
lodging
many
to whom
he expounded
fully testifying
to the
kingdom
-
of God
persuading
then
them
concerning
-
Jesus
from
both
the
law
of Moses
and
the
Prophets
from
morning
to
evening
And
some
indeed
were persuaded of
the things
he is speaking
some
however
refused to believe
Discordant
then
being
with
one another
they began to leave
having spoken
-
Paul
word
one
-
Rightly
the
Spirit
-
Holy
spoke
by
Isaiah
the
prophet
to
the
fathers
of you
saying
Go
to
the
people
this
and
say
In hearing
you will hear
and
no
not
understand
and
in seeing
you will see
and
no
not
perceive
Has grown dull
for
the
heart
of the
people
this
and
with the
ears
barely
they hear
and
the
eyes
of them
they have closed
lest
ever
they should see
with the
eyes
and
with the
ears
they should hear
and
with the
heart
they should understand
and
should turn
and
I will heal
them
Known
therefore
be it
to you
that
to the
Gentiles
has been sent
this
-
salvation
-
of God
they
then
will listen
He stayed
then
two years
whole
in
his own
rented house
and
was welcoming
all
-
coming
unto
him
proclaiming
the
kingdom
-
of God
and
teaching
the things
concerning
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
with
all
boldness
unhinderedly
Paul
a servant
of Christ
Jesus
a called
apostle
having been set apart
for
[the] gospel
of God
which
He promised beforehand
through
the
prophets
of Him
in
[the] Scriptures
Holy
concerning
the
Son
of Him
-
having come
of [the]
seed
of David
according to
flesh
-
having been declared
Son
of God
in
power
according to [the]
Spirit
of holiness
by
resurrection
[from the] dead
Jesus
Christ
the
Lord
of us
through
whom
we have received
grace
and
apostleship
unto
obedience
of faith
among
all
the
Gentiles
on behalf of
the
name
of Him
among
whom
are
also
you
called
of Jesus
Christ
To all
those
being
in
Rome
beloved
of God
called
saints
Grace
to you
and
peace
from
God
[the] Father
of us
and
[the] Lord
Jesus
Christ
First
indeed
I thank
the
God
of me
through
Jesus
Christ
for
all
of you
because
the
faith
of you
is being proclaimed
in
all
the
world
Witness
for
my
is
-
God
whom
I serve
in
the
spirit
of me
in
the
gospel
of the
Son
of Him
how
unceasingly
mention
of you
I make
always
upon
the
prayers
of me
imploring
if
perhaps
now
at last
I will make a prosperous journey
by
the
will
-
of God
to come
to
you
I long
for
to see
you
that
some
I may impart
gift
to you
spiritual
to
the
strengthening
of you
that
now
is
to be encouraged together
among
you
through
the
among
one another
faith
of you
both
and
of me
Not
I do want
now
you
to be ignorant
brothers
that
many times
I purposed
to come
to
you
and
was hindered
until
the
present
that
some
fruit
I might have
also
among
you
as
even
among
the
other
Gentiles
To Greeks
both
and
to barbarians
to [the] wise
both
and
[the] foolish
a debtor
I am
Thus
-
as to
me [there is]
readiness
also
to you
who [are]
in
Rome
to preach the gospel
Not
for
I am ashamed of
the
gospel
[the] power
for
of God
it is
unto
salvation
to everyone
-
believing
to Jewish
both
first
and
to Greek
[The] righteousness
for
of God
in
it
is revealed
from
faith
to
faith
as
it has been written
-
And
the righteous
by
faith
will live
Is revealed
for
[the] wrath
of God
from
heaven
upon
all
ungodliness
and
unrighteousness
of men
-
the
truth
by
unrighteousness
suppressing
because
the
known
-
of God
manifest
is
among
them
-
God
for
to them
has revealed [it]
The
for
invisible qualities
of Him
from
[the] creation
of [the] world
by the
things made
being understood
are clearly seen
the
both
eternal
of Him
power
and
divinity
for
-
to be
them
without excuse
For
having known
-
God
not
as
God
they glorified [Him]
or
were thankful
but
they became futile
in
the
thinking
of them
and
was darkened
the
foolish
of them
heart
Professing
to be
wise
they became fools
and
they changed
the
glory
of the
immortal
God
into
a likeness
of an image
of mortal
man
and
birds
and
quadrupeds
and
creeping things
Therefore
gave up
them
-
God
in
the
desires
of the
hearts
of them
to
impurity
-
to dishonor
the
bodies
of them
between
themselves
who
changed
the
truth
-
of God
into
the
falsehood
and
reverenced
and
served
the
created thing
beyond
the [One]
having created [it]
who
is
blessed
to
the
ages
Amen
Because of
this
gave up
them
-
God
to
passions
of dishonor
-
Even
for
females
of them
changed
the
natural
use
into
that
contrary to
nature
Likewise
then
also
the
males
having left
the
natural
use
of the
female
were inflamed
in
the
desire
of them
toward
one another
males
with
males
the
shame
working out
and
the
recompense
which
was fitting
of the
error
of them
in
themselves
receiving
And
as
not
they did see fit
-
God
to have
in [their]
knowledge
gave up
them
-
God
to
a depraved
mind
to do
things
not
being proper
being filled with
all
unrighteousness
wickedness
covetousness
malice
full
of envy
murder
strife
deceit
maliciousness
gossips
slanderers
hateful to God
insolent
arrogant
boastful
inventors
of evil things
to parents
disobedient
foolish
untrustworthy
heartless
unmerciful
who
the
righteous decree
-
of God
having known
that
those
such
things
doing
worthy
of death
are
not
only
them
are practicing
but
also
are approving of
those
practicing [them]
Therefore
inexcusable
you are
O
man
each one
who
is judging
In
that which
for
you judge
the
other
yourself
you are condemning
-
for
the same things
you do
the [one]
judging
We know
however
that
the
judgment
-
of God
is
according to
truth
upon
those
-
such things
practicing
Suppose you
now
this
O
man
the [one]
judging
those
-
such things
practicing
and
doing
them [yourself]
that
you
will escape
the
judgment
-
of God
Or
the
riches
of the
kindness
of Him
and
the
forbearance
and
the
patience
despise you
not knowing
that
the
kindness
-
of God
to
repentance
you
leads
Because of
however
the
hardness
of you
and
unrepentant
heart
you are treasuring up
to yourself
wrath
in
[the] day
of wrath
and
revelation
of righteous judgement
-
of God
who
will give
to each
according to
the
works
of him
to those who
indeed
with
endurance
in work
good
glory
and
honor
and
immortality
are seeking
life
eternal
to those
however
of
self-interest
and
disobeying
the
truth
being persuaded about
however
-
unrighteousness
wrath
and
anger
tribulation
and
distress
upon
every
soul
of man
-
working
-
evil
of Jewish
both
first
and also
of Greek
glory
however
and
honor
and
peace
to everyone
-
doing
-
good
to Jewish
both
first
and
to Greek
Not
for
there is
partiality
with
-
God
As many as
for
without [the] Law
have sinned
without [the] Law
also
will perish
and
as many as
in
[the] Law
have sinned
by
[the] Law
will be judged
not
for
the
hearers
of [the] law [are]
righteous
with
-
God
but
the
doers
of [the] law
will be justified
When
for
Gentiles
-
not
the law
having
by nature
the things
of the
law
do
these
[the] Law
not
having
to themselves
are
a law
who
show
the
work
of the
law
written
in
the
hearts
of them
bearing witness
their
-
conscience
and
between
one another
the
thoughts
accusing
or
also
defending [them]
on
[that]
day
will judge
-
God
the
secrets
-
of men
according to
the
gospel
of me
by
Christ
Jesus
If
however
you
a Jew
are called
and
rely on
[the] law
and
boast
in
God
and
know
the
will
and
approve
the things
being superior
being instructed
out of
the
law
are persuaded [that]
then
you yourself
a guide
are
of [the] blind
a light
to those
in
darkness
an instructor
of [the] foolish
a teacher
of infants
having
the
embodiment
-
of knowledge
and
of the
truth
in
the
law
[you]
then
teaching
another
yourself
not
do you teach
You
preaching
not
to steal
do you steal
You
saying
not
to commit adultery
do you commit adultery
You
abhorring
-
idols
do you rob temples
You who
in
law
boast
through
the
transgression
of the
law
-
God
dishonor you
-
For
[The] name
-
of God
through
you
is blasphemed
among
the
Gentiles
as
it has been written
Circumcision
indeed
-
profits
if
[the] law
you do
if
however
a transgressor
of law
you are
the
circumcision
of you
uncircumcision
has become
If
therefore
the
uncircumcision
the
requirements
of the
law
keeps
not
the
uncircumcision
of him
for
circumcision
will be reckoned
And
will judge
the
by
nature
uncircumcision
the
law
fulfilling
you
who
with
[the] letter
and
circumcision
[are] a transgressor
of law
Not
for
the [one]
on
the
outward
a Jew
is
neither
the [one]
outwardly
the
outward
in
flesh
[is] circumcision
but
he who [is]
on
the
inward
a Jew [is one]
and
circumcision [is]
of heart
in
spirit
not
in letter
of whom
the
praise
[is] not
of
men
but
of
-
God
What
then [is]
the
superiority
of the
Jew
Or
what [is]
the
benefit
of the
circumcision
Much
in
every
way
Chiefly
indeed
for
that
they were entrusted with
the
oracles
-
of God
What
for
if
disbelieved
some
Not
the
unbelief
of them
the
faithfulness
-
of God
will nullify
Never
may it be
Let be
however
-
God
true
every
now
man
a liar
as
it has been written
That
-
You may be justified
in
the
words
of You
and
will prevail
in
-
being judged
Your
If
however
the
unrighteousness
of us
Godâs
righteousness
shows
what
shall we say
[Is]
unrighteous
-
God
-
inflicting
the
wrath
According to
man
I speak
Never
may it be
Otherwise
how
will judge
-
God
the
world
If
however
the
truth
-
of God
in
-
my
lie
abounded
to
the
glory
of Him
why
still
also I
as
a sinner
am judged
And [is it]
not
as
we are slanderously charged
and
as
affirm
some [that]
us
to say
-
Let us do
things
evil
that
may come
the
good things
Their
-
condemnation
just
is
What
then
Are we better
Not
at all
We have already charged
for
Jews
both
and
Greeks
all
under
sin
to be
As
it has been written
-
None
there is
righteous
not even
one
none
there is
-
understanding
none
there is
-
seeking after
-
God
All
have turned away
together they
have become worthless
none
there is
who
is practicing
good
not
there is
so much as
one
A grave
having been opened
the
throat
of them [is]
with the
tongues
of them
they keep practicing deceit
[the] venom
of vipers
[is] under
the
lips
of them
of whom
the
mouth
of cursing
and
of bitterness
is full
swift [are]
the
feet
of them
to shed
blood
ruin
and
misery
[are] in
the
paths
of them
and
[the] way
of peace
not
they have known
Not
there is
fear
of God
before
the
eyes
of them
We know
now
that
whatever
the
law
says
to those
under
the
law
it speaks
so that
every
mouth
may be stopped
and
under judgment
may be
all
the
world
-
to God
Therefore
by
works
of [the] Law
not
will be justified
any
flesh
before
Him
through
for
[the] Law
[is] knowledge
of sin
Now
however
apart from
law
[the] righteousness
of God
has been revealed
being borne witness to
by
the
Law
and
the
Prophets
[the] righteousness
now
of God
through
faith
from Jesus
Christ
toward
all
those
believing
Not
for
there is
distinction
All
for
have sinned
and
fall short
of the
glory
-
of God
being justified
freely
by the
of Him
grace
through
the
redemption
that
[is] in
Christ
Jesus
whom
set forth as
-
God
a propitiation
through
faith
in
-
His
blood
for
a showing forth
of the
righteousness
of Him
because of
the
forbearance
of the
having taken place beforehand
sins
in
the
forbearance
-
of God
for
of
[the] showing forth
the
righteousness
of Him
in
the
present
time
for
-
to be
Him
just
and
justifying
the [one]
of
faith
of Jesus
Where
then [is]
the
boasting
It has been excluded
Through
what
principle
That
of works
No
but
through
[the] principle
of faith
We reckon
therefore
to be justified
by faith
a man
apart from
works
of the Law
Or
of Jews
[is He] the
God
only
not
also
of Gentiles
Yes
also
of Gentiles
since indeed
One
-
God [is]
who
will justify
[the] circumcision
by
faith
and
[the] uncircumcision
through
the [same]
faith
Law
then
do we nullify
through
-
faith
Never
may it be
Instead
law
we uphold
What
then
shall we say
discovered
Abraham
the
father
of us
according to
[the] flesh
If
for
Abraham
by
works
was justified
he has
ground of boasting
but
not
toward
God
What
for
the
Scripture
says
Believed
then
Abraham
-
God
and
it was reckoned
to him
for
righteousness
To the [one]
now
working
the
reward
not
is reckoned
according to
grace
but
according to
debt
To the [one]
however
not
working
believing
however
on
the [One]
justifying
the
ungodly
is reckoned
the
faith
of him
for
righteousness
just as
also
David
declares
the
blessedness
of the
man
to whom
-
God
credits
righteousness
apart from
works
Blessed
[are they] of whom
are forgiven
the
lawless deeds
and
of whom
are covered
the
sins
blessed
[the] man
against whom
no
not
will reckon
[the] Lord
sin
[Is] the
blessing
then
this
on
the
circumcision
or
also
on
the
uncircumcision
We are saying
for
was credited
-
to Abraham
the
faith
as
righteousness
How
then
was it credited
In
circumcision
being
or
in
uncircumcision
Not
in
circumcision
but
in
uncircumcision
And
[the] sign
he received
of circumcision
a seal
of the
righteousness
of the
faith
that [he had]
[while] in
the
uncircumcision
for
the
to be
him
father
of all
those
believing
in
uncircumcision
for
-
to be credited
to them
the
righteousness
and
father
of circumcision
to those
not
of
circumcision
only
but
also
to those
walking
in the
steps
of the
during
uncircumcision
faith
of the
father
of us
Abraham
Not
for
through
[the] Law
the
promise [was]
-
to Abraham
or
the
descendants
of him
that
heir
he
should be
[of the] world
but
through
[the] righteousness
of faith
If
for
those
of
[the] Law [are]
heirs
has been made void
-
faith
and
made of no effect
the
promise
-
For
law
wrath
brings
where
now
no
there is
law
neither [is]
transgression
Therefore
it [is]
of
faith
that [it may be]
according to
grace
for
-
to be
sure
the
promise
to all
the
seed
not
to that
of
the
law
only
but
also
to that
of [the]
faith
of Abraham
who
is
[the] father
of all
of us
as
it has been written
-
A father
of many
nations
I have made
you
before
whom
he believed
God
the [One]
giving life
to the
dead
and
calling
the things
not
[into] being
even
existing
who
against
hope
in
hope
believed
for
-
to become
him
[the] father
of many
nations
according to
that
having been spoken
So
shall be
the
offspring
of you
And
not
having become weak
in the
faith
he considered
-
of himself
the body
having become dead
a hundred years old
about
being
and
the
lifelessness
of the
womb
of Sarah
At
however
the
promise
-
of God
not
he did waver
-
through unbelief
but
was strengthened
-
in faith
having given
glory
-
to God
and
having been fully assured
that
what
He had promised
able
He is
also
to do
Therefore
also
it was credited
to him
unto
righteousness
Not
it was written
now
on account of
him
alone
that
it was credited
to him
but
also
on account of
us
to whom
it is about
to be credited
to those
believing
on
the [One]
having raised
Jesus
the
Lord
of us
out from
[the] dead
who
was delivered over
for
the
trespasses
of us
and
was raised
for
the
justification
of us
Having been justified
therefore
by
faith
peace
we have
with
-
God
through
the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
through
whom
also
-
access
we have
by the
faith
into
the
grace
this
in
which
we stand
and
we boast
in
hope
of the
glory
-
of God
Not
only [so]
now
but
also
we glory
in
-
tribulations
knowing
that
-
tribulation
perseverance
produces
-
And
perseverance
character
-
and
character
hope
-
And
hope
not
does make [us] ashamed
because
the
love
-
of God
has been poured out
into
the
hearts
of us
through
[the] Spirit
Holy
the [One]
having been given
to us
Yet
indeed
Christ
being
of us
without strength
still
according to
[the] right time
for
[the] ungodly
died
Rarely
indeed
for
a righteous [man]
anyone
will die
on behalf of
though
the
good [man]
perhaps
someone
even
would dare
to die
Demonstrates
however
the
of Himself
love
to
us
-
God
that
still
sinners
being
of us
Christ
for
us
died
Much
therefore
more
having been justified
now
by
the
blood
of Him
we will be saved
by
Him
from
the
wrath
If
for
enemies
being
we were reconciled
-
to God
through
the
death
of the
Son
of Him
much
more
having been reconciled
shall we be saved
in
the
life
of Him
Not
only [so]
now
but
also
we are rejoicing
in
-
God
through
the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
through
whom
now
the
reconciliation
we have received
Because of
this
just as
through
one
man
-
sin
into
the
world
entered
and
through
-
sin
-
death
also
thus
to
all
men
-
death
passed
for
that
all
sinned
Until
for
[the] law
sin
was
in [the]
world
sin
however
not
is imputed
not
there being
law
Nevertheless
reigned
-
death
from
Adam
until
Moses
even
over
those
not
having sinned
in
the
likeness
of the
transgression
of Adam
who
is
a type
of the
coming [One]
But
[is] not
like
the
trespass
so
also
the
gift
If
for
by the
of the
one
trespass
the
many
died
how much
more
the
grace
-
of God
and
the
gift
in
grace
which [is]
of the
one
man
Jesus
Christ
to
the
many
did abound
And
[is] not
as
through
one
having sinned
the
gift
The
truly
for
judgment [was]
of
one
[was] unto
condemnation
-
but
the gift
[is] out of
many
trespasses
unto
justification
If
for
by the
of the
one
trespass
-
death
reigned
through
the
one
how much
more
those
the
abundance
-
of grace
and
of the
gift
-
of righteousness
receiving
in
life
will reign
through
the
one
Jesus
Christ
So
then
just as
by
one
trespass
to
all
men
[it is] unto
condemnation
so
also
by
one
act of righteousness
to
all
men
[it is] unto
justification
of life
For as
for
through
the
disobedience
of the
one
man
sinners
were made
the
many
so
also
through
the
obedience
of the
One
righteous
will be made
the
many
[The] law
now
entered
so that
might abound
the
trespass
where
however
abounded
-
sin
overabounded
-
grace
so that
just as
reigned
the
sin
in
-
death
so
also
-
grace
might reign
through
righteousness
unto
life
eternal
through
Jesus
Christ
the
Lord
of us
What
then
will we say
Shall we continue
-
in sin
that
-
grace
may abound
Never
may it be
Who
we died
-
to sin
how
still
shall we live
in
it
Or
are you unaware
that
as many as
have been baptized
into
Christ
Jesus
into
the
death
of Him
have been baptized
We were buried
therefore
with Him
through
-
baptism
into
-
death
so that
just as
was raised up
Christ
out from
[the] dead
by
the
glory
of the
Father
so
also
we
in
newness
of life
should walk
If
for
united
we have become
in the
likeness
of the
death
of Him
certainly
also
of the
resurrection
we will be
this
knowing
that
-
old
of us
self
was crucified with [Him]
so that
might be annulled
the
body
-
of sin
[that]
no longer
are enslaved
we
-
to sin
The [one]
for
having died
has been freed
from
-
sin
If
now
we died
with
Christ
we believe
that
also
we will live with
Him
knowing
that
Christ
having been raised up
out from
[the] dead
no more
dies
Death
Him
no longer
rules over
That which
for
He died
-
to sin
He died
once for all
that which
however
He lives
He lives
-
to God
So
also
you
consider
yourselves
to be
dead
indeed
-
to sin
living
however
-
to God
in
Christ
Jesus
Not
therefore
let reign
-
sin
in
the
mortal
of you
body
in order
-
to obey
the
desires
of it
Neither
yield
the
members
of you
[as] instruments
of unrighteousness
-
to sin
but
yield
yourselves
-
to God
as
out from
[the] dead
living
and
the
members
of you
[as] instruments
of righteousness
-
to God
Sin
for
you
not
will rule over
not
for
you are
under
law
but
under
grace
What
then
Shall we sin
because
not
we are
under
law
but
under
grace
Never
may it be
Not
know you
that
to whom
you yield
yourselves
[as] slaves
for
obedience
slaves
you are
to him whom
you obey
whether
of sin
to
death
or
of obedience
to
righteousness
Thanks [be]
however
-
to God
that
you used to be
slaves
-
of sin
you have become obedient
now
from [the]
heart
to
which
you were handed over
to the form
of teaching
Having been set free
now
from
-
sin
you have become slaves
-
to righteousness
In human terms
I speak
on account of
the
weakness
of the
flesh
of you
For as
for
you yielded
the
members
of you
in bondage
-
to impurity
and
to
lawlessness
unto
-
lawlessness
so
now
yield
the
members
of you
in bondage
-
to righteousness
unto
sanctification
When
for
slaves
you were
-
of sin
free
you were
-
from righteousness
What
therefore
fruit
had you
then
in the [things]
of which
now
you are ashamed
The
for
end
of those things
[is] death
Now
however
having been set free
from
-
sin
having become slaves
now
-
to God
you have
the
fruit
of you
unto
sanctification
-
now
the end
[is] life
eternal
The
for
wages
-
of sin
[is] death
-
but
the gift
-
of God
life
eternal
in
Christ
Jesus
the
Lord
of us
Or
are you ignorant
brothers
to those knowing
for
law
I speak
that
the
law
rules over
the
man
for
as long as
[the] time
he is alive
The
for
married
woman
to the
living
husband
is bound
by law
if
however
should die
the
husband
she is cleared
from
the
law
of the
husband
Then
therefore
being alive
the
husband
an adulteress
she will be called
if
she is
to man
another
if
however
should die
the
husband
free
she is
from
the
law
[so as for]
not
to be
her
an adulteress
having been
to man
another
Likewise
brothers
of me
also
you
have been put to death
to the
law
through
the
body
-
of Christ
for
-
to belong
you
to another
to the [One]
out from
[the] dead
having been raised
so that
we should bear fruit
-
to God
While
for
we were
in
the
flesh
the
passions
-
of sins
that [were]
through
the
law
were at work
in
the
members
of us
to
the
bringing forth of fruit
-
to death
Now
however
we have been released
from
the
law
having died
to
that which
we were bound
in order for
to serve
us
in
newness
of [the] Spirit
and
not
in oldness
of [the] letter
What
then
shall we say
[Is] the
law
sin
Never
may it be
But
-
sin
not
I have known
if
not
by
law
-
then
for
covetousness
not
I had been conscious of
if
not
the
law
had said
Not
you shall covet
An occasion
however
having taken
-
sin
by
the
commandment
it produced
in
me
all
covetousness
apart from
for
[the] Law
sin
[is] dead
I
however
was alive
apart from
law
once
having come
however
the
commandment
the
sin
revived
I
then
died
And
proved to be
me
the
commandment
that [was]
to
life
this
to
death
The
for
sin
an occasion
having taken
by
the
commandment
deceived
me
and
by
it
put [me] to death
So
-
indeed
the law [is]
holy
and
the
commandment [is]
holy
and
righteous
and
good
That which
then
[is] good
to me
has become
death
Never
may it be
But
-
sin
in order that
it might be shown to be
sin
through
that which [is]
good
to me
is working out
death
so that
might become
beyond
excess
sinful
-
sin
through
the
commandment
We know
for
that
-
[the] Law
spiritual
is
I
however
fleshly
am
having been sold
under
-
sin
What
for
I do
not
I understand
not
for
what
I want
this
I do
but
what
I hate
this
I do
If
now
that which
not
I do want
this
I do
I consent
to the
law
that [it is]
good
In that case
now
no longer
I
am doing
it
but
the
dwelling
in
me
sin
I know
for
that
nothing
there dwells
in
me
that
is
in
the
flesh
of me
good
-
for
to will
is present with
me
-
but
to do
the
good
not
Not
for
that
I desire
I do
good
but
that
not
I do want
evil
this
I practice
If
now
what
not
I do want
I
this
do
[it is] no longer
I
who do
it
but
-
dwelling
in
me
sin
I find
so
the
principle
that
desiring
me
to do
-
good
that
me
-
evil
is present with
I delight
for
in the
law
-
of God
according to
the
inward
man
I see
however
another
law
in
the
members
of me
warring against
the
law
of the
mind
of me
and
making captive
me
to
the
law
-
of sin
-
being
in
the
members
of me
O wretched
I am
man
Who
me
will deliver
out of
the
body
-
of death
this
Thanks [be]
to
God
through
Jesus
Christ
the
Lord
of us
Then
so
myself
I
with the
indeed
mind
serve
law
Godâs
-
but [with]
the flesh
[the] law
of sin
[There is] no
therefore
now
condemnation
to those
in
Christ
Jesus
-
For
the law
of the
Spirit
of
life
in
Christ
Jesus
has set free
you
from
the
law
-
of sin
and
-
of death
-
For
powerless [being]
the
law
in
that
it was weak
through
the
flesh
-
God
-
of Himself
Son
having sent
in
likeness
of flesh
of sin
and
for
sin
condemned
-
sin
in
the
flesh
so that
the
righteousness
of the
law
should be fulfilled
in
us
-
not
according to
the flesh
walking
but
according to
[the] Spirit
Those
for
according to
flesh
being
the things
of the
flesh
mind
those
however
according to
Spirit
the things
of the
Spirit
The
for
mind
of the
flesh
[is] death
the
but
mind
of the
Spirit
life
and
peace
because
the
mind
of the
flesh
[is] hostility
toward
God
to
for
[the] law
-
of God
not
it is subject
nor even
for
can it [be]
Those
now
in
flesh
being
God
to please
not
are able
You
now
not
are
in
flesh
but
in
Spirit
if indeed [the]
Spirit
of God
dwells
in
you
if
however
anyone
[the] Spirit
of Christ
not
has
he
not
is
of Him
If
however
Christ
[is] in
you
the
indeed
body [is]
dead
on account of
sin
the
however
Spirit
[is] life
on account of
righteousness
If
now
the
Spirit
of the [One]
having raised up
-
Jesus
out from
[the] dead
dwells
in
you
the [One]
having raised up
out from
[the] dead
Christ
Jesus
will give life
also
to the
mortal
bodies
of you
on account of
-
dwelling
His
Spirit
in
you
So
then
brothers
debtors
we are
not
to the
flesh
-
according to
flesh
to live
If
for
according to
flesh
you live
you are about
to die
if
however
by [the] Spirit
the
deeds
of the
body
you put to death
you will live
As many as
for
by [the] Spirit
of God
are led
these
sons
are
of God
Not
for
you have received
a spirit
of bondage
again
to
fear
but
you have received
[the] Spirit
of divine adoption as sons
by
whom
we cry
Abba
-
Father
Himself
the
Spirit
bears witness with
the
spirit
of us
that
we are
children
of God
If
now
children
also
heirs
heirs
indeed
of God
joint-heirs
now
of Christ
if indeed
we suffer with [Him]
so that
also
we may be glorified together
I reckon
for
that
not
comparable
the
sufferings
of the
present
time [are]
to
the
coming
glory
to be revealed
to
us
The
for
earnest expectation
of the
creation
the
revelation
of the
sons
-
of God
awaits
To the
for
futility
the
creation
was subjected
not
willingly
but
because of
the [One]
having subjected [it]
in
hope
that
also
itself
the
creation
will be set free
from
the
bondage
-
of decay
into
the
freedom
of the
glory
of the
children
-
of God
We know
for
that
all
the
creation
groans together
and
travails together
until
-
now
Not
only [so]
now
but
even
ourselves
the
firstfruit
of the
Spirit
having
we
also
ourselves
in
ourselves
groan
divine adoption as sons
awaiting
the
redemption
of the
body
of us
In this
for
hope
we were saved
hope
however
being seen
not
is
hope
what
for
sees
any
one
does he hope for
If
however
what
not
we see
we hope for
in
patience
we await
Likewise
now
also
the
Spirit
joins to help
the
weakness
of us
the
for
things which
we should pray for
as
it behooves
not
we know
but
Himself
the
Spirit
makes intercession
with groanings
inexpressible
The [One]
now
searching
-
hearts
knows
what [is]
the
mindset
of the
Spirit
because
according to
God
He intercedes
for
[the] saints
We know
now
that
to those
loving
-
God
all things
works together
for
good
to those
according to
[His] purpose
called
being
For
those whom
He foreknew
also
He predestined [to be]
conformed to
the
image
of the
Son
of Him
for
-
to be
Him
firstborn
among
many
brothers
Those whom
then
He predestined
these
also
He called
and
whom
He called
these
also
He justified
whom
then
He justified
these
also
He glorified
What
then
will we say
to
these things
If
-
God [is]
for
us
who [can be]
against
us
He who
indeed
the
own
Son
not
spared
but
for
us
all
gave up
Him
how
not
also
with
Him
things
all
us
will He grant
Who
will bring an accusation
against
[the] elect
of God
God [is]
the [One]
justifying
Who [is]
the [one]
condemning
[For it is] Christ
Jesus
the [one]
having died
rather
now
having been raised up
who
is
at [the]
right hand
-
of God
who
and
is interceding
for
us
Who
us
will separate
from
the
love
-
of Christ
Tribulation
or
distress
or
persecution
or
famine
or
nakedness
or
danger
or
sword
As
it has been written
-
For the sake
of you
we face death
all
the
day
we were regarded
as
sheep
of slaughter
But
in
these things
all
we more than conquer
through
the [One]
having loved
us
I am persuaded
for
that
neither
death
nor
life
nor
angels
nor
principalities
nor
things present
nor
things to come
nor
powers
nor
height
nor
depth
nor
any
created thing
other
will be able
us
to separate
from
the
love
-
of God
-
in
Christ
Jesus
the
Lord
of us
[The] truth
I speak
in
Christ
Not
I am lying
bearing witness with
me
the
conscience
of me
in [the]
Spirit
Holy
that
grief
to me
is
great
and
unceasing
sorrow
in the
heart
of me
Could wish
for
a curse
to be
myself
I
separated from
-
Christ
for
the
brothers
of me
-
kinsmen
of me
according to
[the] flesh
who
are
Israelites
whose [is]
the
divine adoption as sons
and
the
glory
and
the
covenants
and
the
lawgiving
and
the
service
and
the
promises
whose [are]
the
patriarchs
and
from
whom [is]
-
Christ
-
according to
the flesh
-
being
over
all
God
blessed
to
the
ages
Amen
[It is] not
as
however
that
has failed
the
word
-
of God
Not
for
all
who [are]
of
Israel
[are] these
Israel
Nor
because
they are
seed
of Abraham
[are] all
children
rather
In
Isaac
will be named
to you
offspring
That
is
not
the
children
of the
flesh
these [are]
children
-
of God
but
the
children
of the
promise
are regarded
as
offspring
Of [the] promise
for
the
word
[is] this
At
the
time
this
I will come
and
there will be
-
to Sarah
a son
Not
only
then
but
also
Rebecca
by
one
conception
having
Isaac
the
father
of us
not yet
for
having been born
nor
having done
anything
good
or
evil
so that
the
according to
election
purpose
-
of God
might stand
not
of
works
but
of
the [One]
calling
it was said
to her
-
The
older
will serve
the
younger
As
it has been written
-
Jacob
I loved
-
but
Esau
I hated
What
then
shall we say
Not
injustice
with
-
God [is there]
Never
may it be
To
Moses
for
He says
I will show mercy to
whom
-
I may show mercy
and
I will have compassion on
whom
-
I may have compassion
So
then
[it is] not
of the
willing
nor
of the
running
but
-
showing mercy
of God
Says
for
the
Scripture
to
Pharaoh
-
For
this very
therefore
I have raised up
you
so that
I might show
in
you
the
power
of Me
and
that
should be declared
the
name
of Me
in
all
the
earth
So
then
to whom
He wants
He shows mercy
whom
now
He wants
He hardens
You will say
to me
then
Why
still
does He find fault
The
for
purpose
of Him
who
is resisting
O
man
but rather
you
who
are
-
answering against
-
God
Not
will say
the
thing formed
to the [One]
having formed [it]
Why
me
have you made
like this
Or
not
has
authority
the
potter
over the
clay
out of
the
same
lump
to make
one
indeed
unto
honor
vessel
one
however
unto
dishonor
What if
now
desiring
-
God
to show
the
wrath
and
to make known
the
power
of Him
bore
with
much
patience
[the] vessels
of wrath
having been fitted
for
destruction
also
that
He might make known
the
riches
of the
glory
of Him
upon
[the] vessels
of mercy
which
He prepared beforehand
for
glory
whom
even
He has called
us
not
only
out from
[the] Jews
but
also
out from
[the] Gentiles
As
also
in
-
Hosea
He says
I will call
that which [is]
not
people
of Me
people
of Me
and
her
not
having been loved
having been loved
and
It will happen that
in
the
place
where
it was said
to them
Not
people
My [are]
You
there
they will be called
sons
of God
[the] living
Isaiah
also
cries out
concerning
-
Israel
Though
shall be
the
number
of the
sons
of Israel
as
the
sand
of the
sea
[only] the
remnant
will be saved
[The] sentence
for
concluding
and
bringing swiftly
will perform [the]
Lord
upon
the
earth
And
as
foretold
Isaiah
If
not
[the] Lord
of Hosts
had left
us
descendants
like
Sodom
-
we would have become
and
like
Gomorrah
-
we would have been made
What
then
will we say
That
Gentiles
-
not
pursuing
righteousness
have attained
righteousness
righteousness
now
that [is]
by
faith
Israel
however
pursuing
a law
of righteousness
to
[that] law
not
did attain
Because of
why
Because [it was]
not
by
faith
but
as
by
works
They stumbled
over the
stone
-
of stumbling
as
it has been written
Behold
I lay
in
Zion
a stone
of stumbling
and
a rock
of offense
and
the [one]
believing
on
Him
never
will be put to shame
Brothers
the
indeed
desire
-
of my
heart
and
the
supplication
to
-
God
on behalf of
them
[is] for
salvation
I bear witness
for
about them
that
zeal
for God
they have
but
not
according to
knowledge
Being ignorant of
for
the
-
of God
righteousness
and
the
own
seeking
to establish
to the
righteousness
-
of God
not
they submitted
[The] end
for
of law
[is] Christ
unto
righteousness
to everyone
-
believing
Moses
for
writes
-
[of] the
righteousness
that [is]
of
law
The
having done
man
will live
by
them
The
however
of
faith
righteousness
thus
speaks
Not
you should say
in
the
heart
of you
Who
will ascend
into
-
heaven
that
is
Christ
to bring down
or
Who
will descend
into
the
abyss
that
is
Christ
out from
[the] dead
to bring up
But
what
says it
Near
you
the
word
is
in
the
mouth
of you
and
in
the
heart
of you
That
is
the
word
-
of faith
which
we proclaim
that
if
you confess
with
the
mouth
of you
[The] Lord [is]
Jesus
and
believe
in
the
heart
of you
that
-
God
Him
raised
out from
[the] dead
you will be saved
In the heart
for
is belief
unto
righteousness
in the mouth
now
is confession
unto
salvation
Says
for
the
Scripture
Everyone
-
believing
on
Him
not
will be put to shame
Not
for
there is
difference
Jew
between
and
Greek
-
for
the same
Lord
of all
is rich
toward
all
those
calling
Him
Whoever
for
that
-
shall call upon
the
name
of [the] Lord
will be saved
How
then
shall they call
on [Him]
whom
not
they believed
How
now
shall they believe on [Him]
of whom
not
they have heard
How
now
shall they hear
apart from
preaching
How
now
shall they preach
if
not
they are sent
As
it has been written
How
beautiful
the
feet
of those
proclaiming good news
good things
But
not
all
heeded
the
good news
Isaiah
for
says
Lord
who
has believed
the
report
of us
So
-
faith [is]
from
hearing
-
and
hearing
through
[the] word
of Christ
But
I ask
no
not
did they hear
Indeed
Into
all
the
earth
has gone out
the
voice
of them
and
to
the
ends
of the
world
the
words
of them
But
I ask
not
Israel
not
did know
First
Moses
says
I
will provoke to jealousy
you
by [those]
not
a nation
by
a nation
without understanding
I will anger
you
Isaiah
then
is very bold
and
says
I was found
those
Me
not
seeking
manifest
I became
to those
Me
not
inquiring after
As for
however
-
Israel
he says
All
the
day
I have stretched out
the
hands
of Me
to
a people
disobeying
and
contradicting
I ask
then
not
did reject
-
God
the
people
of Him
Never
may it be
Also
for
I
an Israelite
am
of [the]
seed
of Abraham
of [the] tribe
of Benjamin
Not
did reject
-
God
the
people
of Him
whom
He foreknew
Or
not
know you
in
Elijah
what
says
the
Scripture
how
he pleads
-
with God
against
-
Israel
Lord
the
prophets
of You
they have killed
the
altars
of You
they have torn down
and I
have been left
alone
and
they are seeking
the
life
of me
But
what [was]
spoken
to him
the
divine answer
I have left
to Myself
seven thousand
men
who
not
have bowed
[the] knee
-
to Baal
Thus
then
also
in
the
present
time
a remnant
according to
[the] election
of grace
there has been
If
now
by grace
no longer
from
works
otherwise
-
grace
no longer
would be
grace
What
then
What
is seeking
Israel
this
not
it has obtained
-
but
the elect
obtained [it]
The
now
rest
were hardened
as
it has been written
Gave
them
-
God
a spirit
of stupor
eyes
-
not
to see
and
ears
-
not
to hear
unto
the
today
day
And
David
says
Let be
the
table
of them
for
a snare
and
for
a trap
and
for
a stumbling block
and
for
a retribution
to them
let be darkened
the
eyes
of them
-
not
to see
and
the
backs
of them
for
ever
bent over
I ask
then
not
did they stumble
that
they might fall
Never
may it be
But
in the
of them
trespass
-
[is] salvation
to the
Gentiles
so as
-
to provoke to jealousy
them
If
however
the
trespass
of them
[is] riches
of [the] world
and
the
failure
of them
[is the] riches
of [the] Gentiles
how much
more
the
fullness
of them
To you
now
I am speaking
the
Gentiles
Upon
as much as
indeed
therefore
am
I
of [the] Gentiles
apostle
the
ministry
of me
I magnify
if
at all
I shall provoke to jealousy
of me
the
flesh
and
shall save
some
of
them
If
for
the
rejection
of them
[is the] reconciliation
of [the] world
what [will be]
the
acceptance
if
not
life
out from
[the] dead
If
now
the
firstfruit
[is] holy
also
the
lump
and
if
the
root
[is] holy
also
the
branches
If
however
some
of the
branches
were broken off
you
now
a wild olive tree
being
were grafted in
among
them
and
a fellow-partaker
of the
root
of the
fatness
of the
olive tree
have become
not
boast over
the
branches
If
now
you boast against [them]
not
you
the
root
support
but
the
root
you
You will say
then
Were broken off
branches
that
I
might be grafted in
Rightly so
by the
unbelief
they were broken off
you
however
-
by faith
stand
Not
high
be minded
but
be afraid
If
for
-
God
the
according to
nature
branches
not
spared
neither
you
will He spare
Behold
therefore
[the] kindness
and
severity
of God
upon
indeed
those
having fallen
severity
toward
however
you
kindness
of God
if
you continue in
the
kindness
otherwise
also
you
will be cut off
Even they
now
if
not
they continue
-
in unbelief
will be grafted in
able
for
is
-
God
again
to graft in
them
If
for
you
out of
the
according to
nature
were cut off
a wild olive tree
and
contrary to
nature
were grafted
into
a cultivated olive tree
how much
more
these
who
according to
nature [are]
will be grafted into
the
own
olive tree
Not
for
I want
you
to be ignorant
brothers
of the
mystery
this
that
not
you may be
in
yourselves
wise
that
a hardening
in
part
-
to Israel
has happened
until
that
the
fullness
of the
Gentiles
may come in
and
so
all
Israel
will be saved
as
it has been written
Will come
out of
Zion
the [One]
Delivering
He will remove
ungodliness
from
Jacob
And
this [is]
to them
the
from
Me
covenant
when
I shall take away
the
sins
of them
As regards
indeed
the
gospel
[they are] enemies
on account of
you
As regards
however
the
election
beloved
on account of
the
patriarchs
Irrevocable
for
[are] the
gifts
and
the
calling
-
of God
Just as
for
you
once
were disobedient
-
to God
now
however
have been shown mercy
the
of these
disobedience
so
also
these
now
have been disobedient
the
for your
mercy
so that
also
they
now
may have mercy shown [them]
Has bound up
for
-
God
-
all
in
disobedience
that
-
all
He may show mercy to
O
[the] depth
of riches
both
of wisdom
and
knowledge
of God
How
unsearchable
the
judgments
of Him
and
untraceable
the
ways
of Him
Who
for
has known
[the] mind
of [the] Lord
or
who
counselor
of Him
has been
Or
who
has first given
to Him
and
it will be recompensed
to him
For
from
Him
and
through
Him
and
unto
Him
-
[are] all things
To Him [be]
the
glory
to
the
ages
Amen
I exhort
therefore
you
brothers
through
the
compassions
-
of God
to present
the
bodies
of you
a sacrifice
living
holy
-
to God
well-pleasing
which is
[the] reasonable
service
of you
And
not
be conformed
to the
age
this
but
be transformed
by the
renewing
of the
mind
for
-
to prove
by you
what [is]
the
will
-
of God
-
good
and
well-pleasing
and
perfect
I say
for
through
the
grace
-
having been given
to me
to everyone
-
being
among
you
not
to be high-minded
above
what
it behooves [you]
to think
but
to think
so as
-
to be sober-minded
to each
as
-
God
has allotted
a measure
of faith
Just as
for
in
one
body
many
members
we have
-
now
the members
all
not
the
same
have
function
so
the
many
one
body
we are
in
Christ
-
and
individually
one
of another
members
We are having
however
gifts
according to
the
grace
-
having been given
to us
different
if
prophecy
according to
the
proportion
of the
faith
or
service
in
the
service
or

in
the

[Let]

in brotherly love
to

Bless
those

Bless
and
not

to rejoice
with the
rejoicing
to weep
with the
weeping
the
same thing
toward
one another
minding
not
the things
haughty
minding
but
with the
lowly
going along
Not
be
wise
in
yourselves
To no one

providing
right
before
all
men
if

of
you
with
all
men
living at peace
never
yourselves
avenging
beloved
instead
give
place
-
to wrath
it has been written
for
Mine [is]
vengeance
I
will repay
says [the]
Lord
On the contrary
If
should hunger
the
enemy
of you
feed
him
if
he should thirst
give drink
him
this
for
doing
coals
of fire
you will heap
upon
the
head
of him
Not
be overcome
by
-
evil
but
overcome
with
-
good
-
evil
Every
soul
to the authorities
being above [him]
let be subject
Not
for
there is
authority
if
not
by
God
those
however
existing
by
God
having been instituted
are
Therefore
the [one]
resisting
the
authority
the
-
of God
ordinance
has resisted
those
now
having resisted
upon themselves
judgment
will bring
The
for
rulers
not
are
a terror
-
to good
works
but
-
to evil
Do you desire
now
not
to fear
the
authority
The
good
do
and
you will have
praise
from
him
Of God
for
servant
he is
to you
for
-
good
If
however
-
evil
you do
be afraid
not
for
in vain
the
sword
he bears
of God
for
a servant
He is
an avenger
for
wrath
to the [one]
-
evil
doing
Therefore
necessary [it is]
to be subject
not
only
on account of
the
wrath
but
also
on account of
the
conscience
Because of
this
for
also
taxes
pay you

they are

for
loving
the

[the] Law
has fulfilled
-
For
Not
you shall commit adultery
Not
you shall murder
Not
you shall steal
Not
you shall covet
and
if
any
other
commandment
in
the
word
this
it is summed up
in
the [saying]
You shall love

-
Love
to the
neighbor
evil
not
does do
[the] fulfillment
therefore
of [the] law
-
love [is]
And
this
knowing
the
time
that [it is the]
hour
already
for you
out of
sleep
to awaken
now
for
nearer
[is] of us
the
salvation
than
when first
we believed
The
night
is nearly over
-
and
the day
has drawn near
We should cast off
therefore
the
works
-
of darkness
we should put on
now
the
armor
-
of light
As
in
daytime
properly
we should walk
not
in reveling
and
drinking
not
in sexual immorality
and
sensuality
not
in dissension
and
jealousy
But
put on
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
and
of the
flesh
provision
not
make
for
desires
The [one]
now
being weak
in the
faith
receive
not
for
passing judgment
on reasonings
One
indeed
believes
to eat
all things
the [one]
however
being weak
vegetables
eats
The [one]
eating
the [one]
not
eating
not
let him despise
the [one]
now
not
eating
him
eating
not
let him judge
-
God
for
him
has received
You
who
are
-
judging
anotherâs
servant
To the
own
master
he stands
or
falls
He will be upheld
however
able is
for
the
Lord
to uphold
him
One
truly
for
judges
a day
[to be] above
[another] day
one
however
judges
every
day [alike]
Each
in
the
own
mind
let be fully assured
The [one]
regarding
the
day
to [the] Lord
regards [it]
does observe
the [one]
eating
to [the] Lord
eats
he gives thanks
for
-
to God
and
the [one]
not
eating
to [the] Lord
not
he eats
and
he gives thanks
-
to God
No one
for
of us
to himself
lives
and
no one
to himself
dies
If
both
for
we should live
to the
Lord
we live
if
also
we should die
to the
Lord
we die
If
both
therefore
we should live
if
also
we should die
the
Lordâs
we are
Unto
this
for
Christ
died
and
lived again
that
both [the]
dead
and
living
He might rule over
You
however
why
judge you
the
brother
or you
or
also
you
why
do despise
the
brother
of you
All
for
we will stand before
the
judgment seat
of
God
It has been written
for
Live
I
says
[the] Lord
that
to Me
will bow
every
knee
and
every
tongue
will confess
-
to God
So
then
each
of us
concerning
himself
account
will give
-
to God
No longer
therefore
one another
should we judge
but
this
determine
rather
-
not
to put
[any] stumbling block
before [your]
brother
or
snare
I know
and
I am persuaded
in [the]
Lord
Jesus
that
nothing [is]
unclean
of
itself
if
not
to him
reckoning
anything
unclean
to be
to that one
unclean [it is]
If
for
on account of
food
the
brother
of you
is grieved
no longer
according to
love
are you walking
Not
with the
food
of you
that one
destroy
for
whom
Christ
died
Not
let be spoken of as evil
therefore
your
-
good
Not
for
is
the
kingdom
-
of God
eating
and
drinking
but
righteousness
and
peace
and
joy
in [the]
Spirit
Holy
The [one]
for
in
these things
serving
-
Christ
[is] well-pleasing
-
to God
and
approved
-
by men
So
then
the things
-
of peace
we should pursue
and
the things
-
for edification
-
among
each other
Not
for the sake of
food
destroy
the
work
-
of God
All things
indeed [are]
clean
but
[it is] wrong
to the
man
-
through
a stumbling block
eating
[It is] good
-
neither
to eat
meat
nor
to drink
wine
nor [anything]
in
which
the
brother
of you
stumbles
You
[the] faith
that
have
to
yourself
keep
before
-
God
Blessed [is]
the [one]
not
judging
himself
in
what
he approves
The [one]
however
doubting
if
he eats
has been condemned
because [it is]
not
of
faith
everything
now
that [is]
not
of
faith
sin
is
We ought
now
we
who [are]
strong
the
weaknesses
of the
weak
to bear
and
not
ourselves
to please
Each
of us
the
neighbor
let please
unto
the
good
for
edification
Even
for
-
Christ
not
Himself
pleased
but
as
it has been written
The
reproaches
of those
reproaching
You
have fallen
on
Me
Whatever
for
was written in the past
for
-
our
instruction
was written
so that
through
-
endurance
and
through
the
encouragement
of the
Scriptures
-
hope
we might have
The
now
God
-
of endurance
and
-
encouragement
may He give
you
the
same
to be of mind
with
one another
according to
Christ
Jesus
so that
with one accord
with
one
mouth
you may glorify
the
God
and
Father
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
Therefore
receive
one another
as
also
-
Christ
received
you
to
[the] glory
-
of God
I say
for
Christ
a servant
to have become
of [the] circumcision
for
[the] truth
of God
in order
-
to confirm
the
promises given
to the
fathers
-
and [for]
the Gentiles
for
mercy
to glorify
-
God
as
it has been written
Because of
this
I will praise
You
among
[the] Gentiles
and
to the
name
of You
will I sing
And
again
it says
Rejoice you
Gentiles
with
the
people
of Him
And
again
Praise
all
the
Gentiles
the
Lord
and
praise
Him
all
the
peoples
And
again
Isaiah
says
There will be
the
root
-
of Jesse
and
the [One]
arising
to rule over
Gentiles
in
Him
[the] Gentiles
will hope
-
And
the God
-
of hope
may fill
you
with all
joy
and
peace
in
-
believing
for
-
to abound
you
in
-
hope
in
[the] power
[of the] Spirit
Holy
I am persuaded
now
brothers
of me
also
myself
I
concerning
you
that
also
you yourselves
full
are
of goodness
being filled
with all
-
knowledge
being able
also
one another
to admonish
More boldly
however
I have written
to you
in
part
as
reminding
you
because of
the
grace
-
having been given
to me
by
-
God
for
-
to be
me
a minister
Christ
of Jesus
to
the
Gentiles
administering the sacred service
of the
gospel
-
of God
so that
might become
the
offering
of the
Gentiles
acceptable
having been sanctified
in [the]
Spirit
Holy
I have
therefore
the
boasting
in
Christ
Jesus
in the things
pertaining to
-
God
Not
for
will I dare
anything
to speak of
what
except
has accomplished
Christ
through
me
unto [the]
obedience
of [the] Gentiles
by word
and
deed
in [the]
power
of signs
and
wonders
in [the]
power
of [the] Spirit
of God
so as
for me
from
Jerusalem
and
around
unto
-
Illyricum
to have fully proclaimed
the
gospel
-
of Christ
thus
now
being ambitious
to preach the gospel
not
where
had been named
Christ
so that
not
upon
anotherâs
foundation
I might build
Rather
as
it has been written
They will see
to whom
not
it was proclaimed
concerning
Him
and
those that
not
have heard
will understand
Therefore
also
I have been hindered
-
many [times]
-
to come
to
you
Now
however
no longer
a place
having
in
the
regions
these
a great desire
now
having had
-
to come
to
you
for
many
years
whenever
-
I may go
to
-
Spain
I hope
for
going through
to see
you
and
by
you
to be equipped
there
if
of you
first
in
part
I should be filled
Now
however
I am going
to
Jerusalem
ministering
to the
saints
Were pleased
for
Macedonia
and
Achaia
a contribution
certain
to make
for
the
poor
among the
saints
-
in
Jerusalem
They were pleased
for
and
debtors
they are
of them
If
for
the things
spiritual
of them
have shared in
the
Gentiles
they ought
also
in
the
material things
to minister
to them
This
therefore
having finished
and
having sealed
to them
the
fruit
this
I will set off
through
you
into
Spain
I know
now
that
coming
to
you
in
[the] fullness
of the blessing
of Christ
I will come
I exhort
now
you
brothers
by
the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
and
by
the
love
of the
Spirit
to strive together with
me
in
the
prayers
for
me
to
-
God
so that
I may be delivered
from
those
refusing to be persuaded
in
-
Judea
and
the
service
of me
which [is]
in
Jerusalem
acceptable
to the
saints
may be
so that
in
joy
having come
to
you
by [the]
will
of God
I may be refreshed with
you
-
And
the God
-
of peace
[be] with
all
of you
Amen
I commend
now
to you

of us

Grace

I thank
the
God
always
concerning
you
for
the
grace
-
of God
-
having been given
you
in
Christ
Jesus
that
in
everything
you have been enriched
in
Him
in
all
speech
and
all
knowledge
as
the
testimony
about
Christ
was confirmed
in
you
so as for
you
not
to be lacking
in
not one
gift
eagerly awaiting
the
revelation
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
who
also
will sustain
you
to [the]
end
blameless
in
the
day
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
Faithful [is]
-
God
by
whom
you were called
into
fellowship
with the
Son
of Him
Jesus
Christ
the
Lord
of us
I exhort
now
you
brothers
by
the
name
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
that
the
same thing
you speak
all
and
not
there be
among
you
divisions
you may be
however
having been knit together
in
the
same
mind
and
in
the
same
judgment
It was shown
for
to me
concerning
you
brothers
of me
by
those
of Chloe
that
quarrels
among
you
there are
I mean
now
this
that
each
of you
says
I
indeed
am
of Paul
I
and
of Apollos
I
and
of Cephas
I
and
of Christ
Has been divided
-
Christ
Not
Paul
was crucified
for
you
Or
into
the
name
of Paul
were you baptized
I thank
that
no one
of you
I baptized
if
not
Crispus
and
Gaius
so that
not
anyone
should say
that
into
-
my
name
you were baptized
I baptized
now
also
the
of Stephanas
household
as to the rest
not
I know
whether
any
other
I baptized
Not
for
sent
me
Christ
to baptize
but
to preach the gospel
not
in
wisdom
of discourse
that
not
be emptied of power
the
cross
of the
Christ
The
message
for
-
of the
cross
to those
indeed
perishing
foolishness
is
those
however
being saved
to us
power
of God
it is
It has been written
for
I will destroy
the
wisdom
of the
wise
and
the
intelligence
of the
intelligent
I will frustrate
Where [is the]
wise
Where [the]
scribe
Where [the]
debater
the
age
of this
Not
has made foolish
-
God
the
wisdom
of the
world
Since
for
in
the
wisdom
-
of God
not
knew
the
world
through
the
wisdom
-
God
was pleased
-
God
through
the
foolishness
of the
proclamation
to save
those
believing
Seeing that
both
Jews
signs
ask for
and
Greeks
wisdom
seek
we
however
preach
Christ
having been crucified
to [the] Jewish
indeed
a stumbling block
to Gentiles
now
foolishness
to them
however
the
called
Jews
both
and
Greeks
Christ
of God
[the] power
and
of God
[the] wisdom
For
the
foolishness
-
of God
wiser
-
than men
is
and
the
weakness
-
of God
stronger
-
than men
Consider
for
the
calling
of you
brothers
that
not
many
wise
according to
flesh [were]
not
many
powerful
not
many
of noble birth
But
the
foolish things
of the
world
has chosen
-
God
that
He might shame
the
wise
and
the
weak things
of the
world
chose
-
God
that
He might shame
the
strong
and
the
low-born
of the
world
and
the things
being despised
chose
-
God
the things
not
being
that
the things
being
He might annul
so that
not
might boast
all
flesh
before
-
God
Out of
Him
however
you
are
in
Christ
Jesus
who
has been made
wisdom
unto us
from
God
righteousness
and
also
sanctification
and
redemption
in order that
as
it has been written
The [one]
boasting
in [the]
Lord
let him boast
And I
having come
to
you
brothers
came
not
according to
excellency
of speech
or
wisdom
proclaiming
to you
the
testimony
-
of God
Nothing
for
I decided
anything
to know
among
you
if
not
Jesus
Christ
and
Him
having been crucified
And I
in
weakness
and
in
fear
and
in
trembling
much
was
with
you
And
the
message
of me
and
the
preaching
of me
[were] not
in
persuasive
of wisdom
words
but
in
demonstration
of [the] Spirit
and
of power
so that
the
faith
of you
not
might be
in
wisdom
of men
but
in
power
of God
Wisdom
however
we speak
among
the
mature
wisdom
however
not
the
age
of this
nor
of the
rulers
the
age
of this
who
are coming to naught
But
we speak
of God
wisdom
in
a mystery
-
having been hidden
which
foreordained
-
God
before
the
ages
for
glory
of us
which
none
of the
rulers
the
age
of this
has understood
if
for
they had understood [it]
not
-
the
Lord
-
of glory
they would have crucified
but
as
it has been written
What
eye
not
has seen
and
ear
not
has heard
and
into
heart
of man
not
has entered
what
has prepared
-
God
for those
loving
Him
To us
for
has revealed [it]
-
God
through
the
Spirit
The
for
Spirit
all things
searches
even
the
depths
-
of God
Who
for
knows
among men
the things
of the
man
if
not
the
spirit
of the
man
that [is]
within
him
So
also
the things
-
of God
no one
knows
if
not
the
Spirit
-
of God
We
now
not
the
spirit
of the
world
have received
but
the
Spirit
who [is]
from
-
God
that
we may know
the things
by
-
God
having been granted
to us
which
also
we speak
not
in
taught
of human
wisdom
words
but
in [those]
taught
of [the] Spirit
by spiritual [means]
spiritual things
communicating
[The] natural
however
man
not
accepts
the things
of the
Spirit
-
of God
foolishness
for
to him
they are
and
not
he is able
to understand [them]
because
spiritually
they are discerned
He who [is]
however
spiritual
judges
-
all things
he himself
however
by
no one
is judged
Who
for
has known
[the] mind
of [the] Lord
Who
will instruct
Him
We
however
[the] mind
of Christ
have
And I
brothers
not
was able
to speak
to you
as
to spiritual
but
as
to fleshly
as
to infants
in
Christ
Milk
you
I gave to drink
not
solid food
not yet
for
were you able
In fact
not
still
now
are you able
still
for
fleshly
you are
Where
for
[are] among
you
jealousy
and
strife
not
fleshly
are you
and
according to
man
are walking
When
for
might say
one
I
indeed
am
of Paul
another
however
I
of Apollos
not
fleshly
are you
Who
then
is
Apollos
Who
now
is
Paul
Servants
through
whom
you believed
also
to each
as
the
Lord
has given
I
planted
Apollos
watered
but
-
God
kept [it] growing
So
neither
the [one]
planting
is
anything
nor
the [one]
watering
but [only]
the [One]
giving growth
God
The [one]
planting
now
and
the [one]
watering
one
are
each
now
the
own
reward
will receive
according to
the
own
labor
Of God
for
we are
fellow workers
Godâs
field
Godâs
building
you are
According to
the
grace
-
of God
-
having been given
to me
as
a wise
master builder
[the] foundation
I have laid
another
however
is building upon [it]
Each one
however
let take heed
how
he builds upon [it]
Foundation
for
another
no one
is able
to lay
besides
the [one]
being already laid
which
is
Jesus
Christ
If
now
anyone
builds
upon
the
foundation
gold
silver
stones
precious
wood
hay
straw
of each
the
work
manifest
will become
the
for
day
will disclose [it]
because
in
fire
it is revealed
and
of each
the
work
what sort
it is
the
fire
itself
will prove
If
of anyone
the
work
will remain
which
he built up
a reward
he will receive
If
of anyone
the
work
will be burned up
he will suffer loss
he himself
however
will be saved
so
however
as
through
fire
Not
know you
that
temple
of God
you yourselves are
and
the
Spirit
-
of God
in
you
dwells
If
anyone
the
temple
-
of God
destroys
will destroy
him
-
God
-
for
the temple
-
of God
holy
is
which
are
you
No one
himself
let deceive
if
anyone
thinks [himself]
wise
to be
among
you
in
the
age
this
foolish
let him become
so that
he may become
wise
The
for
wisdom
of the
world
this
foolishness
with
-
God
is
It has been written
for
[He is] the [One]
catching
the
wise
in
the
craftiness
of them
And
again
[The] Lord
knows
the
thoughts
of the
wise
that
they are
futile
Therefore
no one
let boast
in
men
All things
for
of you
are
whether
Paul
or
Apollos
or
Cephas
or [the]
world
or
life
or
death
or
things present
or
things to come
all
yours
you
now
of Christ
Christ
now
of God
So
us
let regard
a man
as
servants
of Christ
and
stewards
of the mysteries
of God
In this case
moreover
it is required
in
the
stewards
that
faithful
one
shall be found
Me
however
to
the smallest matter
it is
that
by
you
I be examined
or
by
a human
court
In fact
neither
myself
do I examine
Nothing
for
against myself
I am conscious of
yet
not
by
this
have I been justified
the [One]
however
judging
me
[the] Lord
is
So then
not
before [the]
time
anything
judge
until
-
shall have come
the
Lord
who
both
will bring to light
the
hidden things
-
of darkness
and
will make manifest
the
motives
of the
hearts
and
then
the
praise
will come
to each
from
-
God
These things
now
brothers
I have applied
to
myself
and
Apollos
on account of
you
so that
in
us
you may learn
-
not
beyond
what
has been written
that
not
one
for
-
one
you be puffed up
over
the
other
Who
for
you
makes different
What
now
have you
which
not
you did receive
If
now
also
you did receive [it]
why
boast you
as
not
having received [it]
Already
satiated
you are
already
you have been enriched
apart from
us
you reigned
and
I wish that
really
you did reign
so that
also
we
you
might reign with
I think
for
-
God
us
-
apostles
last
has exhibited
as
appointed to death
because
a spectacle
we have become
to the
world
both
to angels
and
to men
We
[are] fools
on account of
Christ
you
however
wise
in
Christ
we
weak
you
however
strong
You
honored
we
however
without honor
As far as
the
present
hour
both
we hunger
and
thirst
and
are poorly clad
and
are buffeted
and
wander homeless
and
we toil
working
with [our]
own
hands
Being reviled
we bless
being persecuted
we endure
being slandered
we entreat
As
[the] scum
of the
earth
we have become
of all [the]
refuse
until
now
Not
shaming
you
do I write
these things
but
as
children
my
beloved
admonishing [you]
If
for
ten thousand
guardians
you should have
in
Christ
yet
not
many
fathers
in
for
Christ
Jesus
through
the
gospel
I
you
have begotten
I exhort
therefore
you
imitators
of me
become
On account of
this
it [is]
I sent
to you
Timothy
who
is
my
child
beloved
and
faithful
in [the]
Lord
who
you
will remind of
the
ways
of me
that [are]
in
Christ
Jesus
as
everywhere
in
every
church
I teach
As to
not
coming
now
of me
to
you
have become puffed up
some
I will come
however
shortly
to
you
if
the
Lord
wills
and
I will find out
not
the
talk
of those
being puffed up
but
the
power
Not
for
in
word
the
kingdom
-
of God [is]
but
in
power
What
desire you
With
a rod
I should come
to
you
or
in
love
a spirit
then
of gentleness
Actually
is reported
among
you
sexual immorality
and
such
sexual immorality
as
not even
among
the
pagans
so as for
[the] wife
one
of the
father
to have
And
you
puffed up
are
and
not
rather
have mourned
so that
might be taken
out of
midst
of you
the [one]
the
deed
this
having done
I
indeed
though
being absent
-
in body
being present
now
-
in spirit
already
have judged
as
being present
the [one]
so
this
having produced
in
the
name
of the
Lord
Jesus
having been gathered together
you
and
-
of me
in spirit
with
the
power
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
to deliver
-
such a one
-
to Satan
for
destruction
of the
flesh
so that
the
spirit
may be saved
in
the
day
of the
Lord
Not
good [is]
the
boasting
of you
Not
know you
that
a little
leaven
all
the
lump
leavens
Cleanse out
the
old
leaven
that
you may be
a new
lump
as
you are
unleavened
Also
for
the
Passover lamb
of us
has been sacrificed
Christ
so that
we might celebrate the feast
not
with
leaven
old
not
with
leaven
of malice
and
wickedness
but
with
unleavened [bread]
of sincerity
and
of truth
I wrote
to you
in
the
letter
not
to associate with
the sexually immoral
not
altogether
with the
sexually immoral
the
world
of this
or
with the
covetous
and
swindlers
or
idolaters
since
you would need
then
from
the
world
to depart
Now
however
I wrote
to you
not
to associate with [him]
if
anyone
a brother
being designated
he is
sexually immoral
or
a coveter
or
an idolater
or
verbal abuser
or
a drunkard
or
swindler
with
such a one
not even
to eat
What
for
[is it] to me
those
outside
to judge
Not
those
within
you
do judge
Those
however
outside
-
God
will judge
Expel
the
evil
out from
yourselves
that
Dare
anyone
of you
a matter
having
against
the
other
go to law
before
the
unrighteous
and
not
before
the
saints
Or
not
know you
that
the
saints
the
world
will judge
And
if
by
you
is to be judged
the
world
unworthy
are you
of cases
of the smallest
Not
know you
that
angels
we will judge
How much more
the things of this life
The things of this life
indeed
so
judgment [as to]
if
you have
the [ones]
being despised
in
the
church
those
set you up
For
shame
to you
I say this
Thus
not
is there
among
you
no one
a wise [man]
who
will be able
to decide
in
between
the
brother
of him
Instead
brother
against
brother
goes to law
and
this
before
unbelievers
Already
indeed
therefore
altogether
a defeat
for you
it is
that
lawsuits
you have
among
one another
Because of
why
not
rather
suffer wrong
Because of
why
not
rather
be defrauded
But
you
do wrong
and
defraud
and
these things
to brothers
Or
not
know you
that
[the] unrighteous ones
of God
[the] kingdom
not
will inherit
Not
be deceived
neither
the sexually immoral
nor
idolaters
nor
adulterers
nor
effeminate
nor
homosexuals
nor
thieves
nor
coveters
not
drunkards
nor
verbal abusers
nor
swindlers
[the] kingdom
of God
will inherit
And
such
some [of]
you were
but
you were washed
but
you were sanctified
but
you were justified
in
the
name
of the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
and
by
the
Spirit
of the
God
of us
All things
to me
are lawful
but
not
all things
do profit
All things
to me
are lawful
but
not
I
will be mastered
by
anything
The
foods
for the
belly
and
the
belly
the
for foods
-
but
God
both
this
and
these
will destroy
-
and
the body [is]
not
-
for sexual immorality
but
for the
Lord
and
the
Lord
for the
body
-
And
God
both
the
Lord
has raised up
and
us
will raise out
by
the
power
of Him
Not
know you
that
the
bodies
of you
members
of Christ
are
Having taken
then
the
members
of the
Christ
shall I make
[them] of a prostitute
members
Never
may it be
Or
not
know you
that
the [one]
being joined
to the
prostitute
one
body
is
Will become
for
it says
the
two
into
flesh
one
The [one]
however
being joined
to the
Lord
one
spirit
is
Flee
-
sexual immorality
Every
sin
whatever
if
might do
a man
outside
the
body
is
the [one]
however
sinning sexually
against
the
own
body
sins
Or
not
know you
that
the
body
of you
a temple
of the
in
you
Holy
Spirit
is
whom
you have
from
God
And
not
you are
your own
you were bought
for
with a price
glorify
therefore
-
God
in
the
body
of you
Concerning
now
the things about which
you wrote
[It is] good
for a man
a woman
not
to touch
Because of
however
-
sexual immorality
each man
the [own]
of him
wife
let have
and
each [woman]
the
own
husband
let have
To the
wife
the
husband
the
duty
let fulfill
likewise
now
also
the
wife
to the
husband
The
wife
the
own
body
not
has authority over
but
the
husband
likewise
now
also
the
husband
of the
own
body
not
has authority over
but
the
wife
Not
deprive
one another
if
not
-
by
mutual agreement
for
a time
that
you might be at leisure
-
for prayer
and
again
together
the
same
be
so that
not
may tempt
you
-
Satan
through
the
lack of self-control
of you
This
now
I say
by way of
concession
not
by way of
command
I wish
now
all
men
to be
like
even
myself
But
each
his own
has
gift
from
God
one [has]
indeed
this
one
however
that
I say
now
to the
unmarried
and
to the
widows
[it is] good
for them
if
they should remain
as
even I
If
however
not
they have self-control
let them marry
better
for
it is
to marry
than
to burn with passion
To those
now
having married
I give this charge
not
I
but
the
Lord
A wife
from
a husband
not
is to be separated
if
however
indeed
she is separated
let her remain
unmarried
or
to the
husband
be reconciled
and
a husband
a wife
not
is to send away
To the
now
rest
I say
I
not
the
Lord
If
any
brother
a wife
has
unbelieving
and
she
consents
to dwell
with
him
not
let him divorce
her
And
a woman
any
has
a husband
unbelieving
and
he
consents
to dwell
with
her
not
let her divorce
the
husband
Is sanctified
for
the
husband
-
unbelieving
in
the
wife
and
is sanctified
the
wife
-
unbelieving
in
the
husband
else
then
the
children
of you
unclean
are
now
however
holy
they are
If
however
the
unbeliever
separates himself
let him separate himself
not
is under bondage
the
brother
or
the
sister
in
-
such [cases]
Into
however
peace
has called
you
-
God
How
for
know you
wife
if
the
husband
you will save
Or
how
know you
husband
if
the
wife
you will save
If
not
to each
as
has assigned
the
Lord
to each
as
has called
-
God
so
let him walk
And
thus
in
the
churches
all
I prescribe
Having been circumcised
anyone
was called
Not
let him be uncircumcised
In
uncircumcision
was called
anyone
Not
let Him be circumcised
-
Circumcision
nothing
is
and
-
uncircumcision
nothing
is
but
keeping
[the] commandments
of God
Each
in
the
calling
in which
he has been called
in
this
let him abide
Slave [being]
were you called
not
to you
let it be a care
but
if
also
you are able
free
to become
rather
take advantage
The [one]
for
in
[the] Lord
having been called
[being] a slave
a freedman
of [the] Lord
is
likewise
the [one]
free
having been called
a slave
is
of Christ
With a price
you were bought
not
become
slaves
of men
Each
wherein
that
he was called
brothers
in
that
let him abide
with
God
Concerning
now
the
virgins
a commandment
of [the] Lord
not
I have
judgment
however
I give
as
having received mercy
from
[the] Lord
trustworthy
to be
I think
therefore
this
good
is
because of
the
present
necessity
that
[it is] good
for a man
-
in the same manner
to remain
Have you been bound
to a wife
Not
seek
to be loosed
Have you been loosed
from
a wife
Not
seek
a wife
If
however
also
you shall have married
not
you did sin
and
if
shall have married
the
virgin
not
she did sin
tribulation
however
in the
flesh
will have
-
such
I
now
you
am sparing
This
now
I say
brothers
The
season
shortened
is
-
From now on
that
both
those
having
wives
as
none
having
should be
and
those
weeping
as
not
weeping
and
those
rejoicing
as
not
rejoicing
and
those
buying
as
not
possessing
and
those
using
the
world
as
not
using [it] as their own
Is passing away
for
the
present form
of the
world
this
I desire
now
you
without concern
to be
The
unmarried man
cares for
the things
of the
Lord
how
he should please
the
Lord
the [one]
however
having been married
cares for
the things
of the
world
how
he should please
the
wife
and
is divided
And
the
woman
-
unmarried
and
-
virgin
cares for
the things
of the
Lord
that
she should be
holy
both
in
body
and
in
spirit
the [one]
however
having been married
cares for
the things
of the
world
how
she should please
the
husband
This
now
for
the
of you
yourselves
benefit
I say
not
that
a restraint
you
I might place upon
but
for
what
[is] seemly
and
devoted
to the
Lord
without distraction
If
however
anyone
to be behaving improperly
to
the
virgin
of him
supposes
if
she is
beyond youth
and
so
it ought
to be
what
he wills
let him do
not
he does sin
let them marry
He who
however
stands
in
the
heart
of him
firm
not
having
necessity
authority
however
having
over
the
own
will
and
this
has judged
in
the
own
heart
to keep
-
the
virgin
well
he will do
So then
also
the [one]
marrying
the
own
virgin
well
does
and
the [one]
not
marrying
better
will do
A wife
is bound
for
as long as
time
may live
the
husband
of her
if
however
shall have died
the
husband
free
she is
to whom
she wills
to be married
only
in
[the] Lord
More blessed
however
she is
if
in the same manner
she should remain
according to
-
my
judgment
I think
now
myself also
[the] Spirit
of God
to have
Concerning
now
the things
sacrificed to idols
we know
indeed
all
knowledge
we have
-
Knowledge
puffs up
-
but
love
builds up
If
anyone
thinks
to have known
anything
not yet
does he know
as
it is necessary
to know
If
however
anyone
loves
-
God
he
is known
by
Him
Concerning
the
eating
therefore
of the
things sacrificed to idols
we know
that
nothing
an idol
[is] in
[the] world
and
that [there is]
no
God
if
not
one
Even
truly
if indeed
there are
[those] called
gods
whether
in
heaven
or
on
earth
as
there are
gods
many
and
lords
many
yet
to us
[there is] one
God
the
Father
of
whom [are]
the things
all
and
we
for
Him
and
one
Lord
Jesus
Christ
by
whom [are]
the things
all
and
we
through
Him
But
not
in
all [is]
this
knowledge
Some
now
-
by habit
until
now
of the
idol
as of
a thing sacrificed to an idol
eat
and
the
conscience
of them
weak
being
it is defiled
Food
however
us
not
will commend
to
God
neither
if
not
we should eat
do we come short
nor
if
we should eat
have we an advantage
Be careful
however
lest
somehow
the
right
of you
this
an occasion of stumbling
becomes
to those
being weak
If
for
anyone
sees
you
-
having
knowledge
in
an idolâs temple
eating
not
the
conscience
of him
weak
being
will be built up
so as
the
things
sacrificed to idols
to eat
Is destroyed
for
the [one]
being weak
through
-
your
knowledge
the
brother
for
whom
Christ
died
Thus
then
sinning
against
the
brothers
and
wounding
their
-
conscience
being weak
against
Christ
you sin
Therefore
if
food
snares
the
brother
of me
never
not
shall I eat
meat
to
the
age
so that
not
the
brother
of me
I might snare
Not
am I
free
Not
am I
an apostle
Not
Jesus
the
Lord
of us
have I seen
Not
the
work
of me
you
are
in
[the] Lord
If
to others
not
I am
an apostle
yet
at least
to you
I am
the
for
seal
of my
the
apostleship
you
are
in
[the] Lord
-
My
defense
to those
me
examining
is
this
No
not
have we
[the] right
to eat
and
to drink
No
not
have we
authority
a sister
a wife
to take about
as
also
the
other
apostles
and
the
brothers
of the
Lord
and
Cephas
Or
only
I
and
Barnabas
not
have we
authority
not
to work
Who
serves as a soldier
at his own
expense
at any time
Who
plants
a vineyard
and
the
fruit
of it
not
does eat
Or
who
shepherds
a flock
and
from
the
milk
of the
flock
not
does drink
Not
according to
man
these things
do I speak
Or
also
the
law
these things
not
says
In
for
the
of Moses
law
it has been written
Not
you shall muzzle
an ox
treading out grain
Not
for the
oxen
is there care
-
with God
Or
because of
us
entirely
is He speaking
For sake of
us
for
it was written
because
ought
in
hope
the [one]
plowing
to plow
and
the [one]
threshing
in
hope
-
to partake
If
we
among you
-
spiritual things
have sown
[is it] a great thing
if
we
from you
-
material things
will reap
If
others
of the
over you
authority
partake
[should] not
more
we
But
not
we did use
the
right
this
Instead
all things
we bear
so that
not
any
hindrance
we should place
to the
gospel
of
Christ
Not
know you
that
those
in the
temple
working
the things
of
the
temple
eat
those
at the
altar
attending
in the
altar
partake
So
also
the
Lord
has prescribed
to those
the
gospel
proclaiming
from
the
gospel
to live
I
however
not
have used
none
of these
Neither
have I written
now
these things
that
thus
it should be
with
me
[it were] good
for
me
rather
to die
than
the
boasting
of me
anyone
will make void
If
for
I preach the gospel
nothing
there is
to me
boasting
necessity
for
me
is laid upon
Woe
however
to me
be
if
not
I should preach the gospel
If
for
willingly
this
I do
a reward
I have
if
however
unwillingly
a stewardship
I am entrusted with
What
then
of me
is
the
reward
That
in preaching the gospel
free of charge
I should offer
the
gospel
so as
-
not
to use up
the
right
of me
in
the
gospel
Free
for
being
from
all
to all
myself
I became servant
so that
the
more
I might gain
And
I became
to the
Jews
like
a Jew
so that
Jews
I might win
To those
under
[the] Law
as
under
[the] law
not
being
myself
under
[the] law
so that
those
under
[the] law
I might win
To those
outside [the] Law
like
outside [the] Law
not
being
outside [the] law
of God
but
under [the] law
to Christ
so that
I might win
those
outside [the] Law
I became
to the
weak
weak
that
the
weak
I might win
These things
to all
I have become
all
so that
by all means
some
I might save
All [things]
now
I do
on account of
the
gospel
that
a fellow partaker
with it
I might become
Not
know you
that
those
in
a race course
running
all
indeed
run
one
however

Thus

Everyone

crown
they might receive

an imperishable
I
therefore
thus
run
as
not
uncertainly
so
I fight
as
not

beating
But
I batter
of me
the
body
and
bring [it] into servitude
not
hardly
to others
having preached
myself
disqualified
I might be
Not
I want
for
you
to be ignorant
brothers
that
the
fathers
of us
all
under
the
cloud
were
and
all
through
the
sea
passed
and
all
into
-
Moses
were baptized
in
the
cloud
and
in
the
sea
and
all
the
same
spiritual
food
ate
and
all
the
same
spiritual
drank
drink
they were drinking
for
from
[the] spiritual
accompanying [them]
rock
the
rock
then
was
-
Christ
Nevertheless
not
with
-
most
of them
was well pleased
-
God
they were strewn
for
in
the
wilderness
These things
now
types
to us
have become
for
-
not
to be
us
desirers
of evil things
as
they also
desired
Neither
idolaters
are you to be
as
some
of them
as
it has been written
Sat down
the
people
to eat
and
to drink
and
rose up
to play
Neither
should we commit sexual immorality
as
some
of them
committed sexual immorality
and
fell
in one
day
twenty
thousand
Neither
should we test
the
Christ
as
some
of them
tested
and
by
-
serpents
were destroyed
Neither
are you to grumble
as
some
of them
grumbled
and
perished
by
the
Destroyer
These things
now
[as] types
happened
to them
were written
then
for
admonition
of us
to
whom
the
ends
of the
ages
are arrived
Therefore
the [one]
thinking
to stand
let him take heed
lest
he fall
Temptation
you
not
has seized
if
not
what is common to man
faithful
now
-
[is] God
who
not
will allow
you
to be tempted
beyond
what
you are able
but
will provide
with
the
temptation
also
the
escape
-
to be able
to endure [it]
Therefore
beloved
of me
flee
from
-
idolatry
As
to sensible [ones]
I speak
judge
for yourselves
what
I say
The
cup
-
of blessing
that
we bless
not
a participation
is it
in the
blood
-
of Christ
The
bread
that
we break
not
a participation
in the
body
-
of Christ
is it
Because [there is]
one
loaf
one
body
the
many
we are
-
for
all
of
the
one
loaf
we partake
Consider
-
Israel
according to
flesh
Not
those
eating
the
sacrifices
fellow partakers
in the
altar
are
What
then
do I mean
That
what is sacrificed to an idol
anything
is
or
that
an idol
anything
is
Rather
that
what
sacrifice
to demons
and
not
to God
they sacrifice
Not
I do wish
now
you
fellow partakers
-
with demons
to be
Not
you are able
[the] cup
of [the] Lord
to drink
and
[the] cup
of demons
Not
you are able
of [the] table
of [the] Lord
to partake
and
of [the] table
of demons
Or
do we provoke to jealousy
the
Lord
Not
stronger
than He
are we
All things
are lawful
but
not
all things
are profitable
All things
are lawful
but
not
all
edify
No one
the [good]
of himself
let seek
but
that
of the
other
Everything
-
in
the meat market
being sold
eat
nothing
inquiring
on account of
-
conscience
The
Lordâs
for
[is] the
earth
and
the
fullness
of it
If
anyone
invites
you
of the
unbelieving
and
you wish
to go
everything
-
being set before
you
eat
nothing
inquiring
on account of
-
conscience
If
however
anyone
to you
should say
This
offered to an idol
is
not
do eat
on account of
him
-
having shown [it]
and
-
conscience
[the] conscience
now
I am saying
not
-
your own
but
that
of the
other
that
what
for
the
freedom
of me
is judged
by
anotherâs
conscience
If
I
with thankfulness
partake
why
am I denounced
for
that which
I
give thanks
Whether
therefore
you eat
or
drink
or
whatever
you do
all things
to the
glory
of God
do
Without offense
both
to Jews
be you
and
Greeks
and
to the
church
-
of God
as
I also
all
in all things
please
not
seeking
the
of myself
profit
but
that
of the
many
that
they may be saved
Imitators
of me
be
as
I also [am]
of Christ
I commend
now
you
that
in all things
me
you have remembered
and
as
I delivered
to you
the
teachings
you are keeping
I want
however
you
to know
that
of every
man
the
head
-
Christ
is
[the] head
now
of [the] woman [is]
the
man
[the] head
now
-
of Christ
-
God
Every
man
praying
or
prophesying
[anything] on
[his] head
having
dishonors
the
head
of him
Every
now
woman
praying
or
prophesying
uncovered
with the
head
dishonors
the
head
of her
one
for
it is
and
the
same
-
with having been shaven
If
for
not
covers her head
a woman
also
let her be shorn
If [it is]
now
disgraceful
to a woman
-
to be shorn
or
to be shaven
let her cover her head
A man
truly
for
not
ought
to cover
the
head
image
and
glory
of God
being
the
woman
however
[the] glory
of man
is
Not
for
is
man
of
woman
but
woman
of
man
Truly
for
not
was created
man
on account of
the
woman
but
woman
on account of
the
man
Because of
this
ought
the
woman
authority
to have
on
the
head
on account of
the
angels
However
neither [is]
woman
separate from
man
nor
man
separate from
woman
in
[the] Lord
Just as
for
the
woman
of
the
man [is]
so
also
the
man
by
the
woman [is]
the
however
all things
of
-
God
In
you
yourselves
judge
Becoming
is it
for a woman
revealed
-
to God
to pray
Not even
-
nature
itself
does teach
you
that
a man
indeed
if
he has long hair
a dishonor
to him
it is
a woman
however
if
she has long hair
glory
to her
it is
For
the
long hair
instead
of a covering
is given
to her
If
now
anyone
is inclined
contentious
to be
we
such
custom
no [other]
have
nor
the
churches
-
of God
In this
now
instructing
not
I do praise
because
not
for
the
better
but
for
the
worse
you come together
First
indeed
for
coming together
you
in
an assembly
I hear
divisions
among
you
there to be
and
in part
it
I believe
It behooves
for
also
factions
among
you
there to be
so that
also
the
approved
evident
should become
among
you
Coming
therefore
of you
together
in one
place
not
it is
[the] Lordâs
supper
to eat
One
for
the
own
supper
takes first
in
-
eating
and
this [one]
indeed
is hungry
that [one]
however
is drunken
No
indeed
houses
not
have you
in
which
to eat
and
to drink
Or
the
church
-
of God
do you despise
and
put to shame
those
nothing
having
What
shall I say
to you
Shall I praise
you
in
this
Not
I praise [you]
I
for
received
from
the
Lord
that which
also
I delivered
to you
that
the
Lord
Jesus
in
the
night
in which
He was betrayed
took
bread
and
having given thanks
He broke [it]
and
said
This
of Me
is
the
body
which [is]
for
you
this
do
in
-
of Me
remembrance
Likewise
also
the
cup
after
-
having supped
saying
This
-
cup
the
new
covenant
is
in
-
My
blood
this
do
as often as
if
you might drink [it]
in
-
of Me
remembrance
As often as
for
if
you may eat
the
bread
this
and
the
cup
may drink
the
death
of the
Lord
you proclaim
until
that
He should come
Therefore
whoever
-
should eat
the
bread
or
should drink
the
cup
of the
Lord
unworthily
guilty
will be
of the
body
and
of the
blood
of the
Lord
Let examine
however
a man
himself
and
in this manner
of
the
bread
let him eat
and
of
the
cup
let him drink
The [one]
for
eating
and
drinking
judgment
on himself
eats
and
drinks
not
discerning
the
body
Because of
this
among
you
many
[are] weak
and
sick
and
are fallen asleep
many
If
for
ourselves
we were judging
not
-
we would come under judgment
Being judged
however
by
the
Lord
we are disciplined
so that
not
with
the
world
we should be condemned
So then
brothers
of me
coming together
in order
-
to eat
one another
wait for
If
anyone
is hungry
at
home
let him eat
so that
not
for
judgment
you might come together
-
And
the other things
as soon as
-
I might come
I will set in order
Concerning
now
-
spiritual [gifts]
brothers
not
I do want
you
to be ignorant
You know
that
when
pagans
you were
to
-
idols
-
mute
even as
-
you were led
being carried away
Therefore
I make known
to you
that
no one
in
[the] Spirit
of God
speaking
says
Accursed [is]
Jesus
and
no one
is able
to say
Lord [is]
Jesus
if
not
in
[the] Spirit
Holy
Varieties
now
of gifts
there are
-
but
the same
Spirit
and
varieties
of services
there are
but
the
same
Lord
and
varieties
of workings
there are
the
but
same
God
-
is working
the
all things
in
everyone
To each
now
is given
the
manifestation
of the
Spirit
for
the
common profiting
To one
truly
for
through
the
Spirit
is given
a word
of wisdom
to another
now
a word
of knowledge
according to
the
same
Spirit
and to a different one
faith
by
the
same
Spirit
to another
now
gifts
of healing
in
that
one
Spirit
to another
now
working
of miracles
to another
now
prophecy
to another
now
distinguishing
of spirits
and to a different one
various kinds
of tongues
to another
now
interpretation
of tongues
All
now
these things
works
the
one
and
the
same
Spirit
apportioning
individually
to each
as
He wills
Just as
for
the
body
one
is
and
members
many
has
all
now
the
members
of the
body
many
being
one
are
body
so
also [is]
-
Christ
Also
for
in
one
Spirit
we
all
into
one
body
were baptized
whether
Jews
or
Greeks
whether
slaves
or
free
and
all
one
Spirit
we were made to drink
Also
for
the
body
not
is
one
member
but
many
If
should say
the
foot
Because
not
I am
a hand
not
I am
of
the
body
not
on account of
this
not
is it
of
the
body
And
if
should say
the
ear
Because
not
I am
an eye
not
I am
of
the
body
not
on account of
this
not
is it
of
the
body
If
all
the
body [were]
an eye
where
[would be] the
hearing
If
all
[were] hearing
where
[would be] the
sense of smell
Now
however
-
God
has arranged
the
members
one
each
of them
in
the
body
as
He desired
If
now
were
-
all
one
member
where
[would be] the
body
Now
however
many
even
[are the] members
one
however
body
Not
is able
now
the
eye
to say
to the
hand
Need
of you
not
I have
Or
again
the
head
to the
feet
Need
of you
not
I have
But
much
rather
those
seeming
members
of the
body
weaker
to be
indispensable
are
and
those which
we think
less honorable
to be
of the
body
these
honor
more abundant
we bestow
and
the
unpresentable [parts]
of us
decorum
more abundant
have
-
and
the presentable [parts]
of us
no
need
have
But
-
God
has composed
the
body
to the [parts]
being deficient
more abundant
having given
honor
that
not
there should be
division
in
the
body
but
the
same
for
one another
should have concern
the
members
And
if
suffers
one
member
suffer with [it]
all
the
members
if
is honored
member
rejoice with [it]
all
the
members
You
now
are
[the] body
of Christ
and
members
in
particular
And
some
indeed
has appointed
-
God
in
the
church
first
apostles
secondly
prophets
third
teachers
then
miracles
then
gifts
of healing
helping
administrating
various kinds
of tongues
Not [are]
all
apostles
Not
all
prophets
Not
all
teachers
Not [have]
all
miracles
Not
all
gifts
have
of healings
Not
all
in tongues
do speak
Not
all
do interpret
Be desirous of
however
the
gifts
-
greater
And
now
according to
a more surpassing
way
to you
I show
If
in the
tongues
-
of men
I speak
and
-
of angels
love
however
not
have
I have become
a brass
sounding
or
a cymbal
clanging
And
if
I should have
prophecy
and
understand
the
mysteries
all
and
all
the
knowledge
and
if
I should have
all
the
faith
so as
mountains
to remove
love
however
not
have
nothing
I am
And
if
I may give away
all
the
possessions
of me
and
if
I may deliver up
the
body
of me
that
I may boast
love
however
not
have
nothing
I am profited
-
Love
is patient
is kind
-
love
not
is envious
-
love
not
is boastful
not
is puffed up
not
acts unbecomingly
not
seeks
the things
of its own
not
is easily provoked
not
it keeps account
-
of wrongs
not
delights
at
-
unrighteousness
rejoices
however
in the
truth
All things
it bears
all things
believes
all things
hopes
all things
endures
-
Love
never
fails
if
however
[there are] prophesies
they will be done away
if
tongues
they will be ceased
if
knowledge
it will pass away
In
part
for
we know
and
in
part
we prophesy
when
however
should come
the
perfect
the
in
part
will be done away
When
I was
a child
I was speaking
like
a child
I was thinking
like
a child
I was reasoning
like
a child
when
I became
a man
I did away with
the things
of the
child
We see
for
presently
through
a glass
in
obscurity
then
however
face
to
face
presently
I know
in
part
then
however
I will know fully
as
also
I have been fully known
Now
however
abide
faith
hope
love
the things
three
these
[the] greatest
however
of these [is]
-
love
Earnestly pursue
-
love
earnestly desire
now
-
spiritual gifts
especially
now
that
you might prophesy
The [one]
for
speaking
in a tongue
not
to men
speaks
but
to God
no one
for
hears
in the Spirit
however
he utters
mysteries
The [one]
however
prophesying
to men
speaks [for]
edification
and
encouragement
and
consolation
The [one]
speaking
in a tongue
himself
edifies
the [one]
however
prophesying
[the] church
edifies
I desire
now
all
you
to speak
in tongues
rather
however
that
you should prophesy
greater [is]
now
the [one]
prophesying
than
the [one]
speaking
in tongues
except
if
not
he should interpret
so that
the
church
edification
might receive
Now
however
brothers
if
I should come
to
you
in tongues
speaking
what
you
will I profit
if
not
to you
I should speak
either
in
revelation
or
in
knowledge
or
in
prophecy
or
teaching
Even
-
lifeless things
a sound
giving
whether
flute
or
harp
if
distinction
to the
sounds
not
they give
how
will it be known
what [is]
being piped
or
-
being harped
Also
for
if
indistinct
[the] trumpet
sound
gives
who
will prepare himself
for
battle
So
also
you
with
the
tongue
if
not
intelligible
speech
you give
how
will it be known
what [is]
being spoken
You will be
for
into
[the] air
speaking
So many
if
it may be
kinds
of languages
there are
in
[the] world
and
none
without meaning
If
therefore
not
I know
the
power
of the
sound
I will be
to the [one]
speaking
a foreigner
and
the [one]
speaking
to
me
a foreigner
So
also
you
since
zealous
you are
of spiritual gifts
for
the
edification
of the
church
search
that
you should cause [it] to abound
Therefore
the [one]
speaking
in a tongue
let him pray
that
he might interpret
If
for
I pray
in a tongue
the
spirit
of me
prays
-
but
the mind
of me
unfruitful
is
What
then
is it
I will pray
with the
spirit
I will pray
however
also
with the
mind
I will sing praise
with the
spirit
I will sing praise
however
also
with the
mind
Otherwise
if
you bless
spirit
the [one]
filling
the
place
of the
uninstructed
how
will he say
the
Amen
at
-
your
thanksgiving
since
what
you say
not
he knows
You
truly
for
well
are giving thanks
but
the
other
not
is edified
I thank
-
God
than all
of you
more
in tongues
speaking
but
in
[the] church
I desire
five
words
with
[the] mind
of me
to speak
that
also
others
I might instruct
rather than
ten thousand
words
in
a tongue
Brothers
not
children
be
in the
minds
Yet
in the
evil
be little children
in the
however
thinking
full grown
be
In
the
law
it has been written
-
By
other tongues
and
by
lips
other
I will speak
to the
people
this
and
not even
thus
will they hear
Me
says
[the] Lord
So then
-
tongues
for
a sign
are
not
to those
believing
but
to the
unbelieving
-
but
prophecy
[is] not
to the
unbelieving
but
to the
believing
If
therefore
gathers
the
church
whole
together
the
place
and
all
should speak
in tongues
come in
however
uninstructed ones
or
unbelievers
not
will they say
that
you are mad
If
however
all
prophesy
should come in
then
some
unbeliever
or
uninstructed
he is convicted
by
all
he is examined
by
all
the
secrets
of the
heart
of him
manifest
become
And
thus
having fallen
upon
[his] face
he will worship
-
God
declaring
that
certainly
-
God
among
you
is
What
then
is it
brothers
When
you may come together
each
a psalm
has
a teaching
has
a revelation
has
a tongue
has
an interpretation
has
All things
for
edification
let be done
If
with a tongue
anyone
speaks
[let it be] by
two
or
the
most
three
and
in
turn
and
one
let interpret
If
however
not
there is
an interpreter
let him be silent
in
[the] church
to himself
then
let him speak
and
-
to God
Prophets
then
two
or
three
let speak
and
the
others
let discern
If
however
to another
a revelation should be made
sitting by
the
first
let be silent
You are able
for
[one] by
one
all
to prophesy
so that
all
may learn
and
all
may be exhorted
And
spirits
of prophets
to prophets
are subject
Not
for
He is
of disorder
the
God
but
of peace
As
in
all
the
churches
of the
saints
the
women
in
the
churches
let them be silent
Not
for
it is allowed
to them
to speak
but
to be in submission
as
also
the
law
says
If
however
anything
to learn
they desire
at
home
the
own
husbands
let them ask
shameful
for
it is
for a woman
to speak
in
[the] church
Or
from
you
the
word
-
of God
has gone out
Or
to
you
only
has it come
If
anyone
considers
a prophet
himself to be
or
spiritual
let him recognize
the things
I write
to you
that
of [the] Lord
are
[the] commands
If
however
anyone
is ignorant
let him be ignored
So
brothers
of me
earnestly desire
-
to prophesy
and
-
to speak
not
do forbid
in tongues
All things
however
properly
and
with
order
let be done
I make known
now
to you
brothers
the
gospel
that
I proclaimed
to you
which
also
you received
in
which
also
you stand
by
which
also
you are being saved
to the
word
I proclaimed
to you
if
you hold fast
unless
if
not
in vain
you have believed
I delivered
for
to you
in
the foremost
what
also
I received
that
Christ
died
for
the
sins
of us
according to
the
Scriptures
and
that
He was buried
and
that
He was raised
the
day
the
third
according to
the
Scriptures
and
that
He appeared
to Cephas
then
to the
Twelve
Thereafter
He appeared
to more than
five hundred
brothers
at once
of
whom
the
greater part
remain
until
now
some
however
have fallen asleep
Then
He appeared
to James
then
to the
apostles
all
Last
then
of all
as
the
untimely birth
He appeared
also to me
I
for
am
the
least
of the
apostles
who
not
am
fit
to be called
an apostle
because
I persecuted
the
church
-
of God
[By the] grace
however
of God
I am
what
I am
and
the
grace
of Him
-
toward
me
not
void
has been
Rather
more abundantly
than them
all
I toiled
not
I
however
but
the
grace
-
of God
with
me
Whether
therefore
I
or
they
thus
we preach
and
thus
you believed
If
now
Christ
is preached
that
out from
[the] dead
He has been raised
how
say
among
you
some
that
a resurrection
of [the] dead
not
there is
If
however
a resurrection
of [the] dead
not
there is
neither
Christ
has been raised
if
then
Christ
not
has been raised
[is] void
then
the
preaching
of us
void
also
the
faith
of you
We are found
then
also
false witnesses
-
of God
because
we have witnessed
concerning
-
God
that
He raised up
-
Christ
whom
not
He has raised
if
then
[the] dead
not
are raised
If
for
[the] dead
not
are raised
neither
Christ
has been raised
if
then
Christ
not
has been raised
futile
the
faith
of you
still
you are
in
the
sins
of you
Then
also
those
having fallen asleep
in
Christ
have perished
If
in
the
life
this
in
Christ
having hope
we are
only
more to be pitied
than all
men
we are
Now
however
Christ
has been raised
out from
[the] dead
firstfruit
of those
having fallen asleep
Since
for
by
a man [came]
death
also
by
a man
resurrection
of [the] dead
For as
indeed
in
-
Adam
all
die
so
also
in
-
Christ
all
will be made alive
Each
however
in
the
own
order
[the] firstfruit
Christ
then
those
of
Christ
at
the
coming
of Him
then
the
end
when
He shall hand over
the
kingdom
to the
God
and
Father
when
He shall have annulled
all
dominion
and
all
authority
and
power
It behooves
for
Him
to reign
until
that
He shall have put
all
the
enemies
under
the
feet
of Him
[The] last
enemy
to be abolished [is]
-
death
All things
for
He has put in subjection
under
the
feet
of Him
When
however
it may be said
that
all things
have been put in subjection
[it is] evident
that
[is] excepted
the [One]
having put in subjection
to Him
-
all things
When
now
shall have been put in subjection
to Him
-
all things
then
also
Himself
the
Son
will be put in subjection
to the [One]
having put in subjection
to Him
-
all things
so that
may be
-
God
all
in
all
Otherwise
what
will they do
who
are baptized
for
the
dead
If
at all
[the] dead
not
are raised
why
also
are they baptized
for
them
Why
also
we
are in danger
every
hour
Every
day
I die
as surely as
the
in you
boasting
brothers
which
I have
in
Christ
Jesus
the
Lord
of us
If
according to
man
I fought wild beasts
in
Ephesus
what
to me
the
profit
If
[the] dead
not
are raised
Let us eat
and
let us drink
tomorrow
for
we die
Not
be misled
Do corrupt
morals
good
companionships
bad
Sober up
righteously
and
not
sin
ignorance
for
of God
some
have
to
[the] shame
of you
I speak
But
will say
someone
How
are raised
the
dead
With what
then
body
do they come
Fool
you
What
you sow
not
does come to life
if
not
it dies
And
what
you sow
not
the
body
that
will be
you sow
but
a bare
grain
if
it may be
of wheat
or
of some
of the
rest
-
But
God
gives
it
a body
as
He has willed
and
to each
of the
seeds
its own
body
Not
all
flesh [is]
the
same
flesh
but
one
indeed
of men
another
now
flesh
of beasts
another
now
flesh
of birds
another
now
of fish
And
bodies [there are]
heavenly
and
bodies
earthly
But
one
truly
[is] the
of the
heavenly
glory
another
now
that
of the
earthly
One [is]
[the] glory
of [the] sun
and
another
[the] glory
of [the] moon
and
another
[the] glory
of [the] stars
star
for
from star
differs
in
glory
So
also [is]
the
resurrection
of the
dead
It is sown
in
decay
it is raised
in
immortality
It is sown
in
dishonor
it is raised
in
glory
It is sown
in
weakness
it is raised
in
power
It is sown
a body
natural
it is raised
a body
spiritual
If
there is
a body
natural
there is
also
spiritual
So
also
it has been written
Became
the
first
man
Adam
into
a soul
living
the
last
Adam
into
a spirit
life-giving
However
not
first [was]
the
spiritual
but
the
natural
then
the
spiritual
The
first
man
[was] from
[the] earth
made of dust
the
second
man
from
heaven
As
the [one]
made of dust
so
also [are]
those
of the earth
and
as
the
heavenly [one]
so
also
those
of heaven
And
as
we have born
the
image
of the
earthly
we shall bear
also
the
image
of the
heavenly
This
now
I say
brothers
that
flesh
and
blood
[the] kingdom
of God
to inherit
not
is able
nor
the
decay
the
immortality
does inherit
Behold
a mystery
to you
I tell
All
not
we will sleep
all
however
we will be changed
in
an instant
in
[the] twinkling
of an eye
at
the
last
trumpet
The trumpet will sound
for
and
the
dead
will be raised
imperishable
and
we
will be changed
It behooves
for
the
perishable
this
to put on
imperishable
and
the
mortal
this
to put on
immortality
When
now
the
perishable
this
shall have put on
imperishable
and
the
mortal
this
shall have put on
immortality
then
will come to pass
the
word
-
having been written
Has been swallowed up
-
death
in
victory
Where
of you
O death
the
victory
Where
of you
O death
the
sting
-
And
the sting
-
of death [is]
-
sin
-
and
the power
-
of sin
the
law
to
however
God
[be] thanks
the [One]
giving
us
the
victory
through
the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
Therefore
brothers
of me
beloved
steadfast
be
immovable
abounding
in
the
work
of the
Lord
always
knowing
that
the
toil
of you
not
is
in vain
in
[the] Lord
Concerning
now
the
collection
which [is]
for
the
saints
as
I have directed
the
churches
-
of Galatia
so
also
you
are to do
Every
first
of the week
each
of you
aside
him
let put
treasuring up
-
what
if
he may be prospered in
so that
not
when
I might come
then
collections
there should be
When
then
I shall have arrived
whomever
if
you might approve
with
letters
these
I will send
to carry
the
bounty
of you
to
Jerusalem
If
then
suitable
it is
for
me also
to go
with
me
they will go
I will come
however
to
you
when
Macedonia
I shall have gone through
Macedonia
for
I am going through
With
you
then
possibly
I will stay
or
even
I will winter
so that
you
me
may equip
wherever
if
I may go
Not
I want
for
you
now
in
passing
to see
I hope
indeed
a time
certain
to remain
with
you
if
the
Lord
permits
I will remain
however
in
Ephesus
until
-
Pentecost
A door
for
to me
has opened
great
and
productive
and
are opposing
many
If
now
comes
Timothy
see
that
without fear
he might be
with
you
the
for
work
of [the] Lord
he is doing
as
also I
Not
anyone
therefore
him
should despise
Equip
however
him
in
peace
so that
he might come
to
me
I am expecting
for
him
with
the
brothers
Concerning
now
Apollos
the
brother
greatly
I exhorted
him
that
he should go
to
you
with
the
brothers
and
at all
not
was
[his] will
that
now
he should come
he will come
however
when
he shall have opportunity
Watch you
stand firm
in
the
faith
act like men
be strong
All things
of you
in
love
let be done
I exhort
now
you
brothers
you know
the
house
of Stephanas
that
it is
firstfruit
-
of Achaia
and
to
service
to the
saints
they have devoted
themselves
that
also
you
be subject
-
to such as these
and
to everyone
-
joining in the work
and
laboring
I rejoice
however
at
the
coming
of Stephanas
and
Fortunatus

Achaicus

your
deficiency
these
have filled up
They refreshed

sufferings
that
also
we
suffer
And
the
hope
of us
[is] steadfast
for
you
knowing
that
as
partners
you are
of the
sufferings
so
also
of the
comfort
Not
for
do we want
you
to be ignorant
brothers
as to
the
affliction
of us
-
having happened
in
-
Asia
that
against
excessively
beyond [our]
power
we were weighed
so as
to despair
for us
even
-
to live
But
we
in
ourselves
the
sentence
-
of death
had
in order that
not
trusting
we should be
in
ourselves
but
in
-
God
the [One]
raising
the
dead
who
from
such a great
a death
has delivered
us
and
will deliver [us]
in
whom
we have hope
that
also
still
He will deliver [us]
joining together
also
of you
for
us
by
supplication
so that
by
many
persons
for the
toward
us
grace bestowed
through
many
thanks may be given
for
us
-
For
the boasting
of us
this
is
the
testimony
of the
conscience
of us
that
in
[the] holiness
and
sincerity
-
of God
not
in
wisdom
fleshly
but
in
[the] grace
of God
we have conducted ourselves
in
the
world
more abundantly
now
toward
you
No
for
other things
we write
to you
other
than
what
you read
or
even
understand
I hope
now
that
to [the]
end
you will understand
as
also
you have understood
us
in
part
so that
boasting
of you
we are
even as
also
you [are]
ours
in
the
day
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
And
with this
-
confidence
I was planning
previously
to
you
to come
so that
a second
blessing of grace
you might have
and
through
you
to pass through
into
Macedonia
and
again
from
Macedonia
to come
to
you
and
by
you
to be set forward
to
-
Judea
Thus
therefore
purposing
not
then
-
lightness
did I use
Or
what
I purpose
according to
flesh
do I purpose
so that
there should be
with
me
-
Yes
yes
and
-
No
no
Faithful
however
-
God [is]
that
the
word
of us
-
to
you
not
was
Yes
and
No
The
-
of God
for
Son
Christ
Jesus
the [One]
among
you
by
us
having been proclaimed
by
me
and
Silvanus
and
Timothy
not
was
Yes
and
No
but
Yes
in
Him
it has always been
As many as
for
promises
of God [there are]
in
Him
[is] the
Yes
Therefore
also
in
Him
the
Amen
-
to God
[is] for
glory
by
us
The [One]
now
establishing
us
with
you
unto
Christ
and
having anointed
us
[is] God
the [One]
also
having sealed
us
and
having given
the
pledge
of the
Spirit
in
the
hearts
of us
I
however
as witness
-
God
call
upon
-
my
soul
that
sparing
you
not yet
have I come
to
Corinth
Not
that
we lord it over
your
-
faith
but
fellow workers
are
of the
joy
with you
in the
for
faith
you stand firm
I judged
for
within myself
this
-
not
again
in
grief
to
you
to come
If
for
I
grieve
you
again
who
-
is gladdening
me
if
not
the [one]
being grieved
by
me
And
I wrote
this
same thing
so that
not
having come
grief
I might have
from [those]
of whom
it behooves
me
to rejoice
trusting
in
all
you
that
-
my
joy
of all
of you
is
Out of
for
much
affliction
and
anguish
of heart
I wrote
to you
through
many
tears
not
that
you might be grieved
but
the
love
that
you might know
that
I have
more abundantly
toward
you
If
however
anyone
has caused grief
not
me
has he grieved
but
in
part
that
not
I might put it too severely
all
you
Sufficient
to
such a one
[is] the
punishment
this
which [is]
by
the
majority
so that
on the contrary
rather
for you
to forgive
and
to comfort [him]
lest
perhaps
-
by more abundant
sorrow
should be overwhelmed
-
such a one
Therefore
I exhort
you
to confirm
toward
him
love
For
this
indeed
also
did I write
so that
I might know
the
proof
of you
whether
to
everything
obedient
you are
To whomever
now
anything
you forgive
I also
and
for
I
to whom
I have forgiven
if
anything
I have forgiven
[it is] for the sake of
you
in
[the] person
of Christ
so that
not
we should be outwitted
by
-
Satan
not
for
of his
-
schemes
we are ignorant
Having come
now
to
-
Troas
for
the
gospel
-
of Christ
also
a door
to me
having been opened
in
[the] Lord
not
I had
rest
in the
spirit
of me
in the
not
finding
my
Titus
the
brother
of me
instead
having taken leave of
them
I went out
to
Macedonia
To
however
God
[be] thanks
the [One]
always
leading in triumph
us
in
-
Christ
and
the
fragrance
of the
knowledge
of Him
making manifest
through
us
in
every
place
For
of Christ
a sweet perfume
we are
-
to God
in
those
being saved
and
in
those
perishing
to one
indeed
an odor
from
death
to
death
to one
now
a fragrance
from
life
to
life
And
for
these things
who [is]
sufficient
Not
for
we are
like
the
many
peddling
the
word
-
of God
but
as
of
sincerity
but
as
of
God
before
God
in
Christ
we speak
Are we beginning
again
ourselves
to commend
Or
not
we need
like
some
commendatory
letters
to
you
or
from
you
The
letter
of us
you
are
having been inscribed
in
the
hearts
of us
being known
and
being read
by
all
men
being revealed
that
you are
a letter
of Christ
having been ministered to
by
us
having been inscribed
not
in ink
but
with [the] Spirit
of God
[the] living
not
on
tablets
of stone
but
on
tablets
of hearts
human
Confidence
now
such
we have
through
-
Christ
toward
-
God
Not
that
from
ourselves
sufficient
we are
to reckon
anything
as
of
ourselves
but
the
sufficiency
of us
[is] of
-
God
who
also
has made competent
us [as]
ministers
of a new
covenant
not
of [the] letter
but
of [the] Spirit
the
for
letter
kills
-
but
the Spirit
gives life
If
now
the
ministry
-
of death
in
letters
having been engraved
on stones
was produced
in
glory
so as for
not
to be able
to look intently
the
sons
of Israel
into
the
face
of Moses
on account of
the
glory
of the
face
of him
which
is fading
how
not
more
the
ministry
of the
Spirit
will be
in
glory
If
for
in the
ministry
-
of condemnation [was]
glory
much
more
abounds
the
ministry
-
of righteousness
[in] glory
Even
for
not
has been glorified
that
having been made glorious
in
this
-
respect
on account of
the
surpassing [it]
glory
If
for
that which
is fading away
[was] through
glory
much
more [is]
that
remaining
in
glory
Having
therefore
such
hope
great
boldness
we use
and
not
as
Moses
would put
a veil
over
the
face
of himself
for
-
not
to look intently
the
sons
of Israel
into
the
end
of that
fading away
But
were hardened
the
minds
of them
Until
for
the
present
day
the
same
veil
at
the
reading
of the
old
covenant
remains
not
being lifted
which
in
Christ
is being removed
But
unto
this day
when
-
shall be read
Moses
a veil
over
the
heart
of them
lies
Whenever
however
if
[one] shall have turned
to
[the] Lord
is taken away
the
veil
The
now
Lord
the
Spirit
is
where
now
the
Spirit
of [the] Lord [is]
[there is] freedom
We
now
all
having been unveiled
in face
the
glory
of [the] Lord
beholding as in a mirror
the
same
image
are being transformed into
from
glory
to
glory
even as
from
[the] Lord
[the] Spirit
Because of
this
having
the
ministry
this
as
we received mercy
not
we lose heart
But
we have renounced
the
hidden things
-
of shame
not
walking
in
craftiness
nor
falsifying
the
word
-
of God
but
-
by manifestation
of the
truth
commending
ourselves
to
every
conscience
of men
before
-
God
If
however
indeed
is
concealed
the
gospel
of us
to
those who
are perishing
it is
concealed
in
whom
the
god
of the
age
this
has blinded
the
minds
of the
unbelieving
so as for
-
not
to beam forth
the
illumination
of the
gospel
of the
glory
-
of Christ
who
is
[the] image
-
of God
Not
for
ourselves
do we proclaim
but
Christ
Jesus
Lord
ourselves
now
servants
of you
for the sake of
Jesus
For [it is]
-
God
-
having said
Out of
darkness
light
shall shine
who
shone
in
the
hearts
of us
for [the]
radiance
of the
knowledge
of the
glory
-
of God
in
[the] face
Christ
We have
now
the
treasure
this
in
earthen
vessels
that
the
surpassingness
of the
power
may be
-
from God
and
not
from
us
in
every [way]
being hard pressed
but
not
being crushed
being perplexed
but
not
despairing
being persecuted
but
not
being forsaken
being struck down
but
not
being destroyed
always
the
death
-
[of] Jesus
in
[our]
body
carrying around
so that
also
the
life
-
of Jesus
in
the
body
of us
should be manifested
always
for
we
the
living
to
death
are being delivered
on account of
Jesus
so that
also
the
life
-
of Jesus
may be manifested
in
the
mortal
flesh
of us
So then
-
death
in
us
works
-
but
life
in
you
Having
however
the
same
spirit
-
of faith
according to
that
having been written
I believed
therefore
I have spoken
also
we
believe
therefore
also
speak
knowing
that
the [One]
having raised up
the
Lord
Jesus
also
us
through
Jesus
will raise up
and
will present [us]
with
you
-
For
all things [are]
for the sake of
you
so that
the
grace
having abounded
through
-
more and more
the
thanksgiving
may increase
to
the
glory
-
of God
Therefore
not
we lose heart
but
if
indeed
the
outward
of us
man
is being brought to decay
yet
the
inner
of us
is being renewed
day
and
day
The
for
momentary
lightness
-
affliction
far
surpassing
to
excessiveness
an eternal
weight
of glory
is producing
for us
not
are looking at
we
the things
being seen
but
the things
not
being seen
The things
for
being seen [are]
temporary
the things
however
not
being seen
[are] eternal
We know
for
that
if
-
earthly
of us
house
the
tent
should be destroyed
a building
from
God
we have
a house
not made with hands
eternal
in
the
heavens
And
indeed
in
this
we groan
the
dwelling
of us
which [is]
from
heaven
to be clothed with
longing
If
indeed
also
having been clothed
not
naked
we will be found
And
for
-
being
in
the
tent
we groan
being burdened
because
that
not
we do wish
to be unclothed
but
to be clothed
that
may be swallowed up
the
mortal
by
-
life
The [One]
now
having prepared
us
for
very
this
[is] God
-
having given
to us
the
pledge
of the
Spirit
being confident
therefore
always
and
knowing
that
being at home
in
the
body
we are absent
from
the
Lord
by
faith
for
we walk
not
by
sight
We are confident
now
and
are pleased
rather
to be absent
out of
the
body
and
to be at home
with
the
Lord
Therefore
also
we are ambitious
whether
being at home
or
being away
well-pleasing
to Him
to be
-
For
all
of us
to be revealed
it behooves
before
the
judgment seat
-
of Christ
that
may receive back
each
the things [done]
in
the
body
according to
what
he did
whether
good
or
evil
Knowing
therefore
the
fear
of the
Lord
men
we persuade
to God
and
we have been made manifest
I hope
now
also
in
the
consciences
of you
to have been made manifest
Not
again
ourselves
are we commending
to you
but
occasion
are giving
to you
of boasting
on behalf of
us
so that
you may have [an answer]
toward
those
in
appearance
boasting
and
not
in
[the] heart
If
for
we are beside ourselves
[it is] to God
or if
we are sober-minded
[it is] for you
The
for
love
-
of Christ
compels
us
having concluded
this
that
One
for
all
has died
therefore
-
all
have died
And
for
all
He died
that
those
living
no longer
to themselves
should live
but
to the [One]
for
them
having died
and
having been raised again
Therefore
we
from
-
now
no one
regard
according to
[the] flesh
Though
even
we have regarded
according to
flesh
Christ
yet
now
no longer
we regard [Him thus]
Therefore
if
anyone
[is] in
Christ
[he is] a new
creation
The
old things
have passed away
behold
has come into being
[the] new
-
And
all things
[are] of
-
God
the [One]
having reconciled
us
to Himself
through
Christ
and
having given
to us
the
ministry
-
of reconciliation
how
that
God
was
in
Christ
[the] world
reconciling
to Himself
not
reckoning
to them
the
trespasses
of them
and
having put
into
us
the
word
-
of reconciliation
For
Christ
therefore
we are ambassadors
as though
-
God
is beseeching
through
us
We implore
on behalf
of Christ
Be reconciled
-
to God
The [One]
not
having known
sin
for
us
sin
He made
so that
we
might become
[the] righteousness
of God
in
Him
Working together
now
also
we exhort
not
in
vain
the
grace
-
of God
to receive
you
He says
for
In a time
acceptable
I listened to
you
and
in
a day
of salvation
I helped
you
Behold
now
[is the] time
of favor
behold
now
[is the] day
of salvation
Nothing
before
no one
placing
an obstacle
so that
not
should be blemished
the
ministry
rather
in
everything
we are commending
ourselves
as
Godâs
servants
in
endurance
great
in
tribulations
in
hardships
in
distresses
in
beatings
in
imprisonments
in
riots
in
labors
in
watchings
in
fastings
in
purity
in
knowledge
in
patience
in
kindness
in [the]
Spirit
Holy
in
love
genuine
in [the]
word
of truth
in [the]
power
of God
with
the
weapons
-
of righteousness
for the
right hand
and
for [the] left
through
glory
and
dishonor
through
bad report
and
good report
as
imposters
and yet
true
as
being unknown
and yet
being well-known
as
dying
and yet
behold
we live
as
being disciplined
and yet
not
being killed
as
being sorrowful
always
yet
rejoicing
as
poor
many
yet
enriching
as
nothing
having
and yet
all things
possessing
The
mouth
of us
has been opened
to
you
Corinthians
the
heart
of us
has been expanded
Not
you are restrained
by
us
you are restrained
however
in
the
affections
of you
-
Now
[as] the same
recompense
as
to children
I speak
be expanded
also
you
Not
become
unequally yoked together
with unbelievers
what
for
partnership [have]
righteousness
and
lawlessness
Or
what
fellowship
light
with
darkness
What
now
harmony
Christ
with
Belial
Or
what
part
to a believer
with
an unbeliever
What
now
agreement
[the] temple
of God
with
idols
We
for
[the] temple
of God
are
[the] living
as
has said
-
God
-
I will dwell
in
them
and
will walk among [them]
and
I will be
their
God
and
they
will be
to Me
a people
Therefore
come out
from
the midst
of them
and
be separate
says
[the] Lord
and
unclean
nothing
touch
and I
will receive
you
and
I will be
to you
for
a father
and
you
will be
to Me
for
sons
and
daughters
says
[the] Lord
Almighty
These
therefore
having
-
promises
beloved
we should cleanse
ourselves
from
every
defilement
of flesh
and
spirit
perfecting
holiness
in
[the] fear
of God
Make room for
us
no one
we have wronged
no one
we have corrupted
no one
we have exploited
For
condemnation
not
I speak
I have before said
for
that
in
the
hearts
of us
you are
for [us]
-
to die together
and
to live together
Great [is]
my
boldness
toward
you
great
my
boasting
on behalf of
you
I have been filled
-
with encouragement
I overabound
-
with joy
upon
all
the
affliction
of us
And
for
having come
of us
into
Macedonia
no
had
rest
the
flesh
of us
but
in
every [way]
we are being pressed
on the outside
conflicts
within
fears
But
the [One]
comforting
the
downcast
comforted
us
-
God
by
the
coming
of Titus
not
only
now
by
the
coming
of him
but
also
by
the
comfort
with which
he was comforted
as to
you
relating
to us
-
your
earnest desire
-
your
mourning
-
your
zeal
for
me
so as
for me
the more
to rejoice
For
if
also
I have grieved
you
in
the
letter
not
I do regret [it]
Though
even
I did regret [it]
I see
that
the
letter
that
if
even
for
an hour
grieved
you
Now
I rejoice
not
that
you were grieved
but
that
you were grieved
unto
repentance
you were grieved
for
according to
God
so that
in
nothing
you might suffer loss
through
us
The
for
according to
God
grief
repentance
to
salvation
without regret
produces
-
and
the of the
world
grief
death
produces
Behold
for
this very
same
thing
according to
God
to have been grieved
how much
has produced
in you
earnestness
but instead
reasoned defense
but
indignation
but
fear
but
longing
but
zeal
but
vindication
In
everything
you have proved
yourselves
innocent
to be
in this
matter
So
if
even
I wrote
to you
[it was] not
for the sake of
the [one]
having done wrong
nor
for the sake of
the [one]
having suffered wrong
but rather
for the sake of
-
being revealed
the
earnestness
of you
which [is]
for
us
to
you
before
-
God
On account of
this
we have been comforted
Besides
now
the
comfort
of us
the more abundantly
rather
we have rejoiced
at
the
joy
of Titus
because
has been refreshed
the
spirit
of him
by
all
of you
For
if
anything
to him
about
you
I have boasted
not
I was put to shame
but
as
all things
in
truth
we have spoken
to you
so
also
the
boasting
of us
to
Titus
truth
became
And
the
affections
of him
more abundantly
toward
you
are
remembering
the
of all
of you
obedience
how
with
fear
and
trembling
you received
him
I rejoice
that
in
everything
I am confident
in
you
We make known
now
to you
brothers
the
grace
-
of God
-
having been bestowed
among
the
churches
-
of Macedonia
that
in
much
proof
of tribulation
the
abundance
of the
joy
of them
and
-
of
deep
poverty
of them
abounded
into
the
riches
the
generosity
of them
For
according to
[their] ability
I testify [that]
and
beyond
[their] ability
[they were] willing of themselves
with
much
entreaty
imploring
of us
for the
grace
and
the
fellowship
of the
service
-
among
the
saints
And
not [only]
as
we had hoped
but
themselves
they gave
first
to the
Lord
and then
to us
by [the]
will
of God
Accordingly
-
exhorted
we
Titus
that
as
he had begun
so
also
he might complete
with
you
as well
the
grace
this
But
even as
in
every [way]
you abound
in faith
and
speech
and
knowledge
and
all
earnestness
and
in the
from
us
to
you
love
that
also
in
this
-
grace
you should abound
Not
as
a command
do I speak
but
through
the
of others
earnestness
also
the
-
of your
love
genuineness
proving
You know
for
the
grace
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
that
for the sake of
you
He became poor
rich
being
so that
you
-
through that
poverty
might be enriched
And
a judgment
in
this [matter]
I give
this
indeed
for you
is profitable
who
not
only
-
to act
but
also
-
to will
have begun
from
a year ago
Now
then
also
the
doing
complete
so that
just as
[there was] the
readiness
of the
to will
so
also
the
to complete
out of
that which
you have
If
for
the
readiness
is present
as
if
he might have
acceptable
not
as
not
he does have
Not
for
that
to others [there may be]
ease
but for you
affliction
but
of
equality
At
the
present
time
-
your
abundance
[will be] for
the
of those
need
so that
also
-
their
abundance
may be
for
the
of you
need
so that
there may be
equality
As
it has been written
He
the
much
not
did abound
and
he
the
little
not
had lack
Thanks
however
-
to God
the [One]
putting
the
same
earnestness
for
you
into
the
heart
of Titus
For
[our]
indeed
appeal
he accepted
very earnest
however
being
of his own accord
he has gone out
to
you
We have sent
now
with
him
the
brother
whose
-
praise
[is] in
the
gospel
through
all
of the
churches
not
only
now
but
also
having been chosen
by
the
churches
fellow traveler
of us
with
-
grace
this
that [is]
being administered
by
us
toward
the
himself
of the
Lord
glory
and
readiness
of us
avoiding
this
lest
anyone
us
should blame
in
the
abundance
this
-
being administered
by
us
We are taking great care to do
for
what is right
not
only
before
[the] Lord
but
also
before
men
We sent with
now
them
the
brother
of us
whom
we have proven
in
many things
often
earnest
to be
now
however
much
earnest
by [his] confidence
more
which [is]
in
you
Whether
as regards
Titus
[he is] partner
my
and
for
you
a fellow worker
or
brothers
our
[they are] apostles
of [the] churches
[the] glory
of Christ
-
Therefore
the proof
of the
love
of you
and
of our
boasting
about
you
to
them
show
in
face
of the
churches
Concerning
now
for
the
service
-
for
the
saints
superfluous
for me
it is
-
to write
to you
I know
for
the
readiness
of you
which
concerning
you
I boast of
to Macedonians
that
Achaia
has been prepared
from
a year ago
and
-
your
zeal
has been provoking
the
greater number
I have sent
however
the
brothers
that
not
the
boasting
of us
which [is]
about
you
should be made void
in
the
matter
this
that
as
I have been saying
prepared
you may be
Not
perhaps
if
should come
with
me
Macedonians
and
find
you
unprepared
would be put to shame
we
that
not
we might say
you
in
the
confidence
this
Necessary
therefore
I esteemed [it]
to exhort
the
brothers
that
they should go before
unto
you
and
should complete beforehand
the
foreannounced
blessing
of you
this
ready
to be
thus
as
a blessing
and
not
as
covetousness
This
now
The [one]
sowing
sparingly
sparingly
also
will reap
and
the [one]
sowing
upon
blessings
upon
blessings
also
will reap
each
as
he purposes
in the
heart
not
out of
regret
or
of
necessity
a cheerful
for
giver
loves
-
God
Able [is]
now
-
God
all
grace
to make abound
to
you
so that
in
every [way]
always
all
sufficiency
having
you may abound
in
every
work
good
As
it has been written
He has scattered abroad
He has given
to the
poor
the
righteousness
of Him
abides
to
the
age
The [One]
now
supplying
seed
to him
sowing
and
bread
for
food
will supply
and
will multiply
the
seed for sowing
of you
and
will increase
the
fruits
of the
righteousness
of you
in
every [way]
enriching you
to
all
generosity
which
produces
through
us
thanksgiving
-
to God
For
the
ministry
of the
service
this
not
only
is
completely filling up
the
needs
of the
saints
but
also
is overflowing
through
many
thanksgivings
-
to God
through
the
proof
of the
service
this
[they] glorifying
-
God
at
the
submission
of the
of confession
of you
to
the
gospel
-
of Christ
and
[the] generosity
of the
participation
toward
them
and
toward
all
and
their
supplication
[is] for
you
a longing
for you
on account of
the
surpassing
grace
-
of God
upon
you
Thanks [be]
-
to God
for
the
indescribable
of Him
gift
Myself
now
I
Paul
exhort
you
by
the
meekness
and
gentleness
-
of Christ
who
as to
appearance
indeed
[am] humble
among
you
being absent
however
am bold
toward
you
I implore [you]
now
that
not
being present
to be bold
with the
confidence
with which
I reckon
to be daring
toward
some
-
reckoning
us
as
according to
flesh
walking
In
flesh
for
walking
not
according to
flesh
do we wage war
The
for
weapons
of the
warfare
of us
[are] not
fleshly
but
powerful
-
divinely
to
[the] demolition
of strongholds
arguments
overthrowing
and
every
high thing
lifting itself up
against
the
knowledge
-
of God
and
taking captive
every
thought
into
the
obedience
-
of Christ
and
in
readiness
having
to avenge
all
disobedience
when
might have been fulfilled
your
-
obedience
The things
according to
appearance
are you looking
If
anyone
is persuaded
in himself
of Christ
to be
this
let him reckon
again
within
himself
that
as
he
[is] of Christ
so
also [are]
we
If
even
for
more abundantly
somewhat
I should boast
concerning
the
authority
of us
which
has given [us]
the
Lord
for
building [you] up
and
not
for
tearing down
you
not
I will be ashamed
that
not
[I] might seem
as if
-
to frighten
you
by means of
the
letters
For
the
letters
indeed
they say
[are] weighty
and
strong
-
but
the presence
of the
body
weak
and
the
speech
having been ignored
This
let reckon
-
such a one
that
such as
we are
-
in word
by
letters
being absent
such [we are]
also
being present
-
in action
Not
for
dare we
to classify
or
to compare
ourselves [with]
some
-
themselves
commending
but
these
by
themselves
themselves
measuring
and
comparing
themselves
with themselves
not
understand
We
however
not
into
the things
beyond measure
will boast
but
according to
the
measure
of the
area
that
has assigned
to us
-
God
a measure
to reach
as far as
also
you
Not
for
as
not
reaching
to
you
we are overextending
ourselves
as far as
for
also
you
we came
in
the
gospel
-
of Christ
not
to
the things
beyond measure
boasting
in
othersâ
labors
hope
however
having
increasing
the
faith
of you
among
you
to be enlarged
according to
the
area
of us
to
abundance
so as
that
beyond
you
to preach the gospel
not
in
anotherâs
area
in
things
ready
to boast
The [one]
however
boasting
in
[the] Lord
let him boast
Not
for
the [one]
himself
commending
this [one]
is
approved
but
the one whom
the
Lord
commends
I wish
you were bearing with
me
little
a
in foolishness
but
indeed
you do bear with
me
I am jealous as to
for
you
of God
with [the] jealousy
I have betrothed
for
you
to one
husband
a virgin
pure
to present
-
to Christ
I am afraid
however
lest
by any means
as
the
serpent
deceived
Eve
in
the
craftiness
of him
might be corrupted
the
minds
of you
from
the
simplicity
and
the
purity
-
in
Christ
If
indeed
for
the [one]
coming
another
Jesus
proclaims
whom
not
we did proclaim
or
a spirit
different
you receive
which
not
you did receive
or
glad tidings
different
which
not
you did accept
well
are you bearing with [it]
I reckon
for
in nothing
to have been inferior
to those
most eminent
apostles
If
however
even
unpolished
-
in speech [I am]
yet
not
-
in knowledge
but
in
every [way]
we have been made manifest
in
all things
to
you
Or
a sin
did I commit
myself
humbling
so that
you
might be exalted
because
freely
the
-
of God
gospel
I preached
to you
Other
churches
I robbed
having received
support
for
the
toward you
service
And
being present
with
you
and
having been in need
not
I did burden
no one
-
for
the need
of me
completely filled up
the
brothers
having come
from
Macedonia
and
in
everything
unburdensome
myself
to you
I kept
and
will keep
Is
[the] truth
of Christ
in
me
that
the
boasting
this
not
will be sealed up
of
mine
in
the
regions
-
of Achaia
Because of
why
Because
not
I do love
you
-
God
knows [I do]
What
however
I do
also
I will do
so that
I might cut off
the
opportunity
of those
desiring
an opportunity
that
in
what
they are boasting
they might be found
as
also
we
-
For
such [are]
false apostles
workers
deceitful
disguising themselves
as
apostles
of Christ
And
no
wonder
himself
for
-
Satan
masquerades
as
an angel
of light
[It is] not
surprising
therefore
if
also
the
servants
of him
masquerade
as
servants
of righteousness
whose
-
end
will be
according to
the
deeds
of them
Again
I say
no
one
me
should think
a fool
to be
if
however
otherwise
even
as
a fool
receive
me
that
I also
little
a
may boast
What
I am saying
not
according to
[the] Lord
am I saying
but
as
in
foolishness
in
this
the
confidence
-
of boasting
Since
many
boast
according to
the
flesh
I also
will boast
Gladly
for
you bear with
-
fools
wise
being
You bear [it]
for
if
anyone
you
enslaves
if
anyone
devours [you]
if
anyone
takes [from you]
if
anyone
exalts himself
if
anyone
in
[the] face
of you
strikes [you]
As to
dishonor
I speak
as
that
we
have been weak
In
whatever
however
-
anyone
might be daring
in
foolishness
I speak
am daring
I also
Hebrews
are they
I also
Israelites
are they
I also
Descendants
of Abraham
are they
I also
Servants
of Christ
are they
As being beside myself
I speak
above [measure]
I [too]
in
labors
more abundantly
in
imprisonments
more abundantly
in
beatings
above measure
in
deaths
often
From
[the] Jews
five times
forty [lashes]
minus
one
I received
Three times
I was beaten with rods
once
I was stoned
three times
I was shipwrecked
a night and a day
in
the
deep [sea]
I have passed
in journeyings
often
in perils
of rivers
in perils
of robbers
in perils
from [my own]
race
in perils
from
[the] Gentiles
in perils
in
[the] city
in perils
in
[the] wilderness
in perils
on
[the] sea
in perils
among
false brothers
in labor
and
toil
in
watchings
often
in
hunger
and
thirst
in
fastings
often
in
cold
and
nakedness
Besides
the things
external
the
pressure
on me
-
on every
day
[is my]
care
for all
the
churches
Who
is weak
and
not
I am weak
Who
is led into sin
and
not
I
do burn inwardly
If
to boast
it behooves [me]
[in] the things
of the
weakness
of me
I will boast
The
God
and
Father
of the
Lord
Jesus
knows
the [One]
being
blessed
to
the
ages
that
not
I am lying
In
Damascus
the
governor
under Aretas
the
king
was guarding
the
city
of the Damascenes
to seize
me
But
through
a window
in
a basket
I was let down
through
the
wall
and
I escaped
the
hands
of him
To boast
it behooves [me]
not
is it profitable
indeed
I will go on
however
to
visions
and
revelations
of [the] Lord
I know
a man
in
Christ
ago
years
fourteen
whether
in
[the] body
not
I know
or
out of
the
body
not
I know
-
God
knows
having been caught up
-
such a man
to
[the] third
heaven
And
I know
-
such
a man
whether
in
[the] body
or
out of
the
body
not
I know
-
God
knows
that
he was caught up
into
-
Paradise
and
he heard
inexpressible
words
-
not
being permitted
to man
to speak
Concerning
-
such a man
I will boast
concerning
however
myself
not
I will boast
if
not
in
the
weaknesses
If
for
I should desire
to boast
not
I will be
a fool
[the] truth
for
I will be speaking
I refrain
however
lest
anyone
to
me
should credit
more than
what
he sees
in me
or
hears
of
me
and
the
surpassingness
of the
revelations
Therefore
that
not
I should become conceited
was given
to me
a thorn
in [my]
flesh
a messenger
of Satan
that
me
he might buffet
so that
not
I should become conceited
For
this
three times
the
Lord
I begged
that
it might depart
from
me
And
He said
to me
Suffices
you
the
grace
of Me
the
for
power
in
weakness
is perfected
Most gladly
therefore
rather
will I boast
in
the
weaknesses
so that
may rest
upon
me
the
power
-
of Christ
Therefore
I take pleasure
in
weaknesses
in
insults
in
hardships
in
persecutions
and
difficulties
for
Christ
when
for
I might be weak
then
strong
I am
I have become
a fool
you
me
compelled
I
for
ought
by
you
to have been commended
In no way
for
was I inferior
to those
most eminent
apostles
though
even
nothing
I am
The
indeed
signs
of the
apostle
were performed
among
you
in
all
perseverance
in signs
both
and
wonders
and
miracles
In what
for
is it
that
you were inferior
beyond
the
rest
[of the] churches
if
not
that
myself
I
not
did burden
you
Forgive
me
the
wrong
this
Behold
third time
this
ready
I am
to come
to
you
and
not
I will burden [you]
not
for
I seek
what [is]
yours
but
you
Not
for
ought
the
children
for the
parents
to treasure up
but
the
parents
for the
children
I
now
most gladly
will spend
and
will be utterly spent
for
the
souls
of you
If
more abundantly
you
loving
less
I am loved
Be it so
however
I
not
did burden
you
but
being
crafty
by trickery
you
I caught
Not
any
of whom
I have sent
to
you
by
him
did I exploit
you
I urged
Titus [to go]
and
sent with [him]
the
brother
Not
did exploit
you
Titus
Not
in the
same
spirit
did we walk
Not
in the
same
steps
All along
have you been thinking
that
to you
we have been making a defense
Before
God
in
Christ
we speak
-
but
all things
beloved
for
-
your
edification
I fear
for
lest
perhaps
having come
not
such as
I wish
I may find
you
and I
might be found
by you
such as
not
you do wish
lest
perhaps
quarreling
jealousy
anger
contentions
slander
gossip
conceit
disorder
lest
again
having come
of me
should humble
me
the
God
of me
as to
you
and
I should mourn over
many
of those
having before sinned
and
not
having repented
of
the
impurity
and
sexual immorality
and
sensuality
that
they have practiced
Third
this [time]
I am coming
to
you
In [the]
mouth
of two
witnesses
or
three
will be established
every
matter
I have warned
and
I warn
as
being present
the
second time
and
being absent
now
those
having sinned before
and
the
rest
all
that
if
I come
to
the [same]
again
not
I will spare [anyone]
since
a proof
you seek
-
in
me
speaking
of Christ
who
toward
you
not
is weak
but
is powerful
among
you
And
for
He was crucified
in
weakness
yet
He lives
by
power
Godâs
Also
for
we
are weak
in
Him
but
we will live
with
Him
by
power
Godâs
toward
you
Yourselves
examine
whether
you are
in
the
faith
yourselves
test
Or
not
do you recognize
yourselves
that
Jesus
Christ [is]
in
you
if
not
unapproved
you are
I hope
now
that
you will know
that
we
not
are
unapproved
We pray
now
to
-
God
not
to do
you
wrong
nothing
not
that
we
approved
might appear
but
that
you
what [is]
right
may do
we
though
as
unapproved
might appear
Nothing
for
have we power
any
against
the
truth
but
for
the
truth
We rejoice
for
when
we
might be weak
you
however
strong
might be
But this
also
We pray for
the
of you
perfection
Because of
therefore
these things
being absent
I write
so that
being present
not
with severity
I should treat [you]
according to
the
authority
that
the
Lord
has given
me
for
building up
and
not
for
tearing down
Finally
brothers
rejoice
Be perfected
be exhorted
[be of] the
same
mind
be at peace
And
the
God
-
of love
and
peace
will be
with
you
Greet
one another
with
a holy
kiss
Greet
you
the
saints
all
The
grace
of the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
and
the
love
of
God
and
the
fellowship
of the
Holy

[be] with
all
of you
Paul
an apostle
not
from
men
nor
through
man
but
through
Jesus
Christ
and
God
[the] Father
the [One]
having raised
Him
out from
[the] dead
and
the
with
me
all
brothers
To the
churches
-
of Galatia
Grace
to you
and
peace
from
God
Father
of us
and
the Lord
Jesus
Christ
the [One]
having given
Himself
for
the
sins
of us
so that
He might deliver
us
out of
the
age
of
having come presently
evil
according to
the
will
of the
God
and
Father
of us
to whom [be]
the
glory
to
the
ages
of the
ages
Amen
I am astonished
that
so
quickly
you are deserting
from
the [One]
having called
you
in
[the] grace
of Christ
to
a different
gospel
which
not
is
another
if
not
some
there are
who
are troubling
you
and
are desiring
to pervert
the
gospel
-
of Christ
But
even
if
we
or
an angel
out of
heaven
should preach a gospel
to you
contrary to
what
we proclaimed
to you
accursed
let him be
As
we have said before
even
now
again
I say
if
anyone
[to] you
is preaching a gospel
contrary to
what
you received
accursed
let him be
Presently
for
of men
do I seek approval
or
-
God
Or
do I seek
men
to please
For if
yet
men
I were pleasing
of Christ
a servant
not
-
I would be
I make known
for
to you
brothers
the
gospel
-
having been preached
by
me
that
not
it is
according to
man
Neither
for
I
from
man
received
it
nor
was I taught [it]
but
by
a revelation
of Jesus
Christ
You have heard of
for
-
my
way of life
former
in
-
Judaism
that
beyond
exceeding measure
I was persecuting
the
church
-
of God
and
was destroying
it
And
I was advancing
in
-
Judaism
beyond
many
contemporaries
in
the
countrymen
of me
more abundantly
zealous
being
of the
fathers
of me
traditions
When
however
was pleased
-
having selected
me
from
[the] womb
of mother
of me
and
having called [me]
by
the
grace
of Him
to reveal
the
Son
of Him
in
me
that
I might preach
Him
among
the
Gentiles
immediately
not
I consulted
with flesh
and
blood
nor
did I go up
to
Jerusalem
to
the
before
me
apostles
but
I went away
into
Arabia
and
again
returned
to
Damascus
Then
after
three
years
I went up
to
Jerusalem
to make acquaintance with
Cephas
and
I remained
with
him
days
fifteen
Other
however
of the
apostles
none
I saw
if
not
James
the
brother
of the
Lord
In what
now
I write
to you
behold
before
-
God
-
not
I lie
Then
I went
into
the
regions
-
of Syria
and
-
Cilicia
I was
then
unknown
-
by face
to the
churches
-
of Judea
that [are]
in
Christ
Only
however
hearing
they were
that
the [one]
persecuting
us
formerly
now
is preaching
the
faith
which
once
he was destroying
And
they were glorifying
in
me
-
God
Then
after
fourteen
years
again
I went up
to
Jerusalem
with
Barnabas
having taken with [me]
also
Titus
I went up
now
according to
a revelation
and
set before
them
the
gospel
that
I proclaim
among
the
Gentiles
apart
individually
however
to those
esteemed
lest
hardly
in
vain
I should be running
or
have run
But
not even
Titus
who [was]
with
me
a Greek
being
was compelled
to be circumcised
because of
even
the
brought in secretly
false brothers
who
came in by stealth
to spy out
the
freedom
of us
which
we have
in
Christ
Jesus
that
us
they will enslave
to whom
not even
for
an hour
did we yield
-
in subjection
so that
the
truth
of the
gospel
might continue
with
you
Of
now
those
esteemed
to be
something
whatsoever
formerly
they were
not
to me
makes a difference
[the] person
-
God
of a man
not
does accept
to me
for
the
esteemed
nothing
added
But
on the contrary
having seen
that
I have been entrusted with
the
gospel
of the
uncircumcision
just as
Peter [with that]
of the
circumcision
the [One]
for
having worked
in Peter
for
apostleship
of the
circumcision
did
also
in me
toward
the
Gentiles
and
having known
the
grace
-
having been given
to me
James
and
Cephas
and
John
those
esteemed
pillars
to be
[the] right hands
gave
to me
and
Barnabas
of fellowship
that
we [should go]
to
the
Gentiles
they
however
to
the
circumcision
Only [they asked]
the
poor
that
we should remember
that
also
I was eager
the same
thing
to do
When
however
came
Peter
to
Antioch
to
face
his
I opposed [him]
because
condemned
he stood
Before
-
for
came
certain ones
from
James
with
the
Gentiles
he was eating
when
however
they came
he was drawing back
and
was separating
himself
being afraid of
those
of
[the] circumcision
And
acted hypocritically
with him
also
the
rest
of [the] Jews
so that
even
Barnabas
was carried away
of them
by the
hypocrisy
But
when
I saw
that
not
they are walking uprightly
according to
the
truth
of the
gospel
I said
-
to Peter
before
all
If
you
a Jew
being
like a Gentile
and
not
like a Jew
live
why
the
Gentiles
do you compel
to Judaize
We
by birth
Jews
and
not
of
[the] Gentiles
sinners
knowing
nevertheless
that
not
is justified
a man
by
works
of law
if
not
through
faith
Christ
from Jesus
even
we
in
Christ
Jesus
have believed
that
we may be justified
by
faith
from Christ
and
not
by
works
of the Law
because
by
works
of the Law
not
will be justified
any
flesh
If
however
seeking
to be justified
in
Christ
have been found
also
we ourselves
sinners
[is] then
Christ
of sin
a minister
Never
may it be
If
for
that
I had torn down
these things
again
I build
a transgressor
myself
I prove
I
for
through
[the] Law
to [the] Law
died
that
to God
I might live


I live
now
no longer
I
lives
however
in
me
Christ
Christ that which
I have been crucified with then
now
I live
in
[the] flesh
through
faith
I live
that
from the
Son
-
of God
the [One]
having loved
me
and
having given up
Himself
for
me
Not
I do set aside
the
grace
-
of God
if
for
through
[the] Law
righteousness [is]
then
Christ
for naught
died
O
foolish
Galatians
Who
you
has bewitched
whose
before
eyes
Jesus
Christ
was publicly portrayed
[as] having been crucified
This
only
I wish
to learn
from
you
by
works
of [the] Law
the
Spirit
did you receive
or
by
hearing
of faith
So
foolish
are you
Having begun
in [the] Spirit
now
in [the] flesh
are you being perfected
So many things
did you suffer
in vain
if
indeed
also
in vain
The [One]
therefore
supplying
to you
the
Spirit
and
working
miracles
among
you
[is it] out of
works
of the Law
or
out of
hearing
of faith
So also
Abraham
believed
-
God
and
it was reckoned
to him
as
righteousness
Know
then
that
those
of
faith
these
sons
are
of Abraham
Having foreseen
then
the
Scripture
that
by
faith
justifies
the
Gentiles
-
God
foretold the gospel
-
to Abraham
-
Will be blessed
in
you
all
the
nations
So then
those
of
faith
are blessed
along with
the
believing
Abraham
As many as
for
of
works
of [the] Law
are
under
a curse
are
it has been written
for
-
Cursed [is]
everyone
who
not
does continue
all things
-
having been written
in
the
book
of the
Law
-
to do
them
That
now
by
[the] law
no one
is justified
before
-
God
[is] evident
because
The
righteous
by
faith
will live
-
And
the Law
not
is
of
faith
rather
The [one]
having done
these things
will live
by
them
Christ
us
redeemed
from
the
curse
of the
Law
having become
for
us
a curse
for
it has been written
Cursed [is]
everyone
-
hanging
on
a tree
so that
to
the
Gentiles
the
blessing
-
of Abraham
might come
in
Jesus
Christ
so that
the
promise
of the
Spirit
we might receive
through
-
faith
Brothers
according to
man
I am speaking
Even
of man
having been ratified
a covenant
no one
sets aside
or
adds thereto
-
And
to Abraham
were spoken
the
promises
and
to the
seed
of him
Not
it does say
and
-
to seeds
as
of
many
but
as
of
One
and
to the
seed
of you
who
is
Christ
This
now
I say
[The] covenant
having been confirmed beforehand
by
-
God
-
afterward
four hundred
and
thirty
years
having come
[the] law
not
does annul
so as
-
to nullify
the
promise
If
for
by
[the] Law [is]
the
inheritance
[it is] no longer
by
a promise
-
but
to Abraham
through
a promise
has granted [it]
-
God
Why
then
the
Law
-
Transgressions
on account of
it was added
until
that
should have come
the
seed
to whom
promise has been made
having been ordained
through
angels
in
[the] hand
of a mediator
-
However
a mediator
of one [person]
not
is
-
but
God
one
is
The
therefore
Law
[is] contrary to
the
promises
-
of God
Never
may it be
If
for
had been given
a law
-
being able
to impart life
indeed
from out of
[the] Law
-
would have emerged
-
righteousness
but
imprisoned
the
Scripture
things
all
under
sin
so that
the
promise
by
faith
from Jesus
Christ
might be given
to those
believing
Before
-
now
came
-
faith
under
the Law
we were held in custody
having been locked up
until
the
being about
faith
to be revealed
so that
the
Law
trainer
of us
has become
unto
Christ
so that
by
faith
we might be justified
Having come
now
-
faith
no longer
under
a trainer
we are
All
for
sons
of God
you are
through
-
faith
in
Christ
Jesus
As many as
for
into
Christ
you were baptized
Christ
you have put on
Neither
there is
Jew
nor
Greek
neither
there is
slave
nor
free
neither
there is
male
and
female
all
for
you
one
are
in
Christ
Jesus
If
now
you [are]
Christâs
then
-
Abrahamâs
seed
you are
according to
[the] promise
heirs
I say
now
for
as long as
time
the
heir
a child
is
not
he differs
from a slave
[though] owner
of everything
being
Instead
under
guardians
he is
and
trustees
until
the
time appointed
by [his]
father
So
also
we
when
we were
children
under
the
basic principles
of the
world
were
held in bondage
When
however
had come
the
fullness
of the
time
sent forth
-
God
the
Son
of him
having been born
of
a woman
having been born
under
[the] Law
that
those
under
[the] Law
He might redeem
so that
the
divine adoption as sons
we might receive
Because
now
you are
sons
sent forth
-
God
the
Spirit
of the
Son
of Him
into
the
hearts
of us
crying out
Abba
-
Father
So
no longer
you are
a slave
but
a son
if
now
a son
also
an heir
through
God
But
at that time
indeed
not
knowing
God
you were enslaved
to those
by nature
not
being
gods
now
however
having known
God
rather
however
having been known
by
God
how
do you turn
again
to
the
weak
and
destitute
principles
to which
again
anew
to be enslaved
you desire
Days
you observe
and
months
and
seasons
and
years
I fear
for you
lest
perhaps
in vain
I have toiled
for
you
Become
as
I [am]
because
I also [have become]
as
you
brothers
I implore
you
In nothing
me
have You wronged
You know
now
that
in
weakness
of the
flesh
I proclaimed the gospel
to you
at the
first
and
the
test
of you
in
the
flesh
of me
not
you did despise [me]
nor
reject [me] with contempt
but
as
an angel
of God
you received
me
even as
Christ
Jesus
What
then
the
blessedness
of you
I bear witness
for
to you
that
if
possible
the
eyes
of you
having gouged out
you would have given [them]
to me
So
enemy
of you
have I become
speaking truth
to you
They are zealous after
you
not
rightly
but
to exclude
you [from us]
They desire
so that
them
you might be zealous after
Good [it is]
now
to be zealous
in
a right [thing]
at all times
and
not
only
in
-
being present
my
with
you
Children
of me
of whom
again
I travail
until
that
shall have been formed
Christ
in
you
I was wishing
indeed
to be present
with
you
presently
and
to change
the
tone
of me
because
I am perplexed
as to
you
Tell
me
those
under
[the] Law
wishing
to be
the
Law
not
you do listen to
It has been written
for
that
Abraham
two
sons
had
one
of
the
slave woman
and
one
of
the
free
But
the [one]
indeed
of
the
slave woman
according to
flesh
has been born
the [one]
but
of
the
free
through
the
promise
which things
are
allegorized
these
for
are
two
covenants
one
indeed
from
Mount
Sinai
unto
slavery
begetting
which
is
Hagar
-
And
Hagar
Sinai
Mount
is
in
-
Arabia
she corresponds
now
to the
present
Jerusalem
she is in slavery
for
with
the
children
of her
-
But
the above
Jerusalem
free
is
who
is
mother
of us
It has been written
for
Rejoice
O barren woman
the [one]
not
bearing
break forth
and
call aloud
the [one]
not
travailing
because
many
[are] the
children
of the
desolate woman
more
than
of her
having
the
husband
You
now
brothers
like
Isaac
of promise
children
are
But
just as
at that time
the [one]
according to
flesh
having been born
was persecuting
the [one born]
according to
Spirit
so
also
[it is] now
But
what
says
the
Scripture
Cast out
the
slave woman
and
the
son
of her
no
for
not
will inherit
the
son
of the
slave woman
along with
the
son
of the
free
So then
brothers
not
we are
of [the] slave woman
children
but
of the
free
In
freedom
us
Christ
has set free
stand firm
therefore
and
not
again
in a yoke
of slavery
entangle yourselves
Behold
I
Paul
say
to you
that
if
you shall become circumcised
Christ
you
nothing
will profit
I testify
now
again
to every
man
being circumcised
that
a debtor
he is
all
the
Law
to keep
You are severed
from
Christ
whoever
in
[the] Law
are being justified
from
grace
you have fallen away
We
for
through [the] Spirit
by
faith
[the] hope
of righteousness
eagerly await
In
for
Christ
Jesus
neither
circumcision
any
has power
nor
uncircumcision
but only
faith
through
love
working
You were running
well
Who
you
cut into
truth
not
to obey
[This]
persuasion [is]
not
of
the [One]
calling
you
A little
leaven
whole
the
lump
leavens
I
am confident
as to
you
in
[the] Lord
that
no
other
mind will you have
The [one]
however
troubling
you
will bear
the
judgment
whoever
if
he might be
I
now
brothers
if
circumcision
still
proclaim
why
still
am I persecuted
In that case
has been abolished
the
offense
of the
cross
I wish
also
will emasculate themselves
those
upsetting
you
You
for
to
freedom
were called
brothers
but
not
the
freedom
for
an opportunity
to the
flesh
Rather
through
-
love
serve
one another
-
For
the entire
Law
in
one
word
is fulfilled
in
this
You shall love
the
neighbor
of you
as
yourself
If
however
one another
you bite
and
devour
take heed
lest
by
one another
you might be consumed
I say
now
by [the] Spirit
walk
and
[the] desire
[of the] flesh
no
not
you should gratify
The
for
flesh
desires
against
the
Spirit
-
and
the Spirit
against
the
flesh
these
for
to one another
are opposed
in order
not
that
if
you might wish
those things
you should do
If
however
[the] Spirit
you are led by
not
you are
under
[the] Law
Evident
now
are
the
works
of the
flesh
which
are
sexual immorality
impurity
sensuality
idolatry
sorcery
enmities
strife
jealousy
outbursts of anger
contentions
dissensions
factions
envyings
drunkennesses
carousing
and
things
like
these
as to which
I forewarn
you
even as
I warned before
that
those
such
things
doing
kingdom
Godâs
not
will inherit
-
But
the fruit
of the
Spirit
is
love
joy
peace
patience
kindness
goodness
faithfulness
gentleness
self-control
against
things
such
no
there is
law
Those
now
-
of Christ
Jesus
the
flesh
have crucified
with
[its]
passions
and
-
desires
If
we live
by [the] Spirit
by [the] Spirit
also
we should walk
Not
we should become
boastful
one another
provoking
one another
envying
Brothers
if
even
should be overcome
a man
in
some
trespass
you
the
spiritual [ones]
restore
-
such a one
in
a spirit
of gentleness
considering
yourself
lest
also
you
be tempted
One anotherâs
-
burdens
bear you
and
thus
you shall fulfill
the
law
-
of Christ
If
for
thinks [himself]
anyone
to be
something
nothing
being
he deceives
himself
-
But
the work
of himself
test
each
and
then
as to
himself
alone
the
ground of boasting
he will have
and
not
as to
-
another
Each
for
-
his own
load
shall bear
Let share
now
the [one]
being taught
in the
word
with the [one]
teaching
in
all
good things
Not
be misled
God
not
is mocked
Whatever
for
if
might sow
a man
that
also
he will reap
For
the [one]
sowing
to
the
flesh
of himself
from
the
flesh
will reap
decay
The [one]
however
sowing
to
the
Spirit
from
the
Spirit
will reap
life
eternal
-
And
[in] well
doing
not
we should grow weary
in time
for
due
we will reap a harvest
not
giving up
So
then
as
occasion
we have
we should work
-
good
toward
all
especially
now
toward
those
of the household
of the
of faith
See
in how large
to you
letters
I have written
with
my own
hand
As many as
wish
to have a fair appearance
in
[the] flesh
these
compel
you
to be circumcised
only
that
for the
cross
-
of Christ
not
they might be persecuted
Not even
for
those
being circumcised
themselves
[the] Law
keep
but
they desire
you
to be circumcised
so that
in
-
your
flesh
they may boast
For me
however
never
may it be
to boast
if
never
in
the
cross
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
through
which
to me
[the] world
has been crucified
and I
[to the] world
Neither
for
circumcision
anything
is
nor
uncircumcision
instead
a new
creation
And
as many as
those who
rule
by this
will walk
peace [be]
upon
them
and
mercy
and
upon
the
Israel
-
of God
The
henceforth
troubles
to me
no one
let give
I
for
the
marks
-
of Jesus
on
of the
body
of me
bear
The
grace
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
[be] with
the
spirit
of you
brothers
Amen

Ephesus

in

Grace
to you
and
peace

God
[the] Father
of us
and
[the] Lord
Jesus
Christ
Blessed [be]
the
God
and
Father
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
the [One]
having blessed
us
with
every
blessing
spiritual
in
the
heavenly realms
in
Christ
just as
He chose
us
in
Him
before
[the] foundation
of [the] world
to be
for us
holy
and
blameless
before
Him
in
love
having predestined
us
for
divine adoption as sons
through
Jesus
Christ
to
Himself
according to
the
good pleasure
of the
will
of Him
to
[the] praise
of [the] glory
of the
of grace
of Him
which
He has freely given
us
in
the
Beloved [One]
in
whom
we have
-
redemption
through
the
blood
of Him
the
forgiveness
-
of trespasses
according to
the
riches
of the
grace
of Him
which
He lavished
upon
us
in
all
wisdom
and
understanding
having made known
to us
the
mystery
of the
will
of Him
according to
the
pleasure
of Him
which
He purposed
in
Him
for
[the] administration
of the
fullness
of the
times
to bring together
the
all things
in
-
Christ
the things
in
the
heavens
and
the things
upon
the
earth
in
Him
in
whom
also
we have obtained an inheritance
having been predestined
according to
[the] purpose
of the [One]
-
all things
working
according to
the
counsel
of the
will
of Him
for
-
to be
us
to
[the] praise
of [the] glory
of Him
the [ones]
having first trusted
in
-
Christ
in
whom
also
you
having heard
the
word
-
of truth
the
gospel
of the
salvation
of you
in
whom
also
having believed
you were sealed
with the
Spirit
-
of promise

Holy
who
is
[the] guarantee
of the
inheritance
of us
to
[the] redemption
of the
acquired possession
to
[the] praise
of the
glory
of Him
Because of
this
I also
having heard of
the
among
you
faith
in
the
Lord
Jesus
and
the
love
-
toward
all
the
saints
not
do cease
giving thanks
for
you
mention
making
in
the
prayers
of me
that
the
God
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
the
Father
-
of glory
may give
to you
[a] spirit
of wisdom
and
revelation
in
[the] knowledge
of Him
being enlightened
the
eyes
of the
heart
of you
in order for
-
to know
you
what
is
the
hope
of the
calling
of Him
what
[are] the
riches
of the
glory
of the
inheritance
of Him
in
the
saints
and
what
[is] the
surpassing
greatness
of the
power
of Him
toward
us
those
believing
according to
the
working
of the
might
of the
strength
of Him
which
He worked
in
-
Christ
having raised
Him
out from
[the] dead
and
having set [Him]
at
[the] right hand
of Him
in
the
heavenly realms
above
every
principality
and
authority
and
power
and
dominion
and
every
name
being named
not
only
in
the
age
this
but
also
in
the [one]
coming
And
all things
He put
under
the
feet
of Him
and
Him
gave
[to be] head
over
all things
to the
church
which
is
the
body
of Him
the
fullness
of the [One]
-
all
in
all
filling
And
you
being
dead
in the
trespasses
and
the
sins
of you
in
which
once
you walked
according to
the
age
the
world
of this
according to
the
ruler
of the
authority
of the
air
the
spirit
-
now
working
in
the
sons
-
of disobedience
among
whom
also
we
all
lived
once
in
the
desires
of the
flesh
of us
doing
the
things willed
of the
flesh
and
of [its]
thoughts
and
we were
children
by nature
of wrath
as
even
the
rest
-
But
God
rich
being
in
mercy
because of
the
great
love
of Him
with which
He loved
us
even
being
we
dead
-
in trespasses
made [us] alive with
-
Christ
by grace
you are
saved
and
He raised [us] up together
and
seated [us] together
in
the
heavenly realms
in
Christ
Jesus
in order that
He might show
in
the
ages
that
[are] coming
the
surpassing
riches
of the
grace
of Him
in
kindness
toward
us
in
Christ
Jesus
-
For
by grace
you are
saved
through
faith
and
this
not
of
yourselves
[it is] of God
the
gift
not
as a result of
works
so that
not
anyone
may boast
Of Him
for
we are
workmanship
having been created
in
Christ
Jesus
for
works
good
which
prepared beforehand
-
God
that
in
them
we should walk
Therefore
remember
that
formerly
you
the
Gentiles
in
[the] flesh
the ones
being called
[the] uncircumcision
by
that
being called
[the] circumcision
in
[the] flesh
made by hands
that
you were
at the
time
that
separate from
Christ
alienated from
the
commonwealth
-
of Israel
and
strangers
to the
covenants
of the
promise
hope
not
having
and
without God
in
the
world
Now
however
in
Christ
Jesus
you
the [ones]
once
being
far off
have become
near
by
the
blood
-
of Christ
He Himself
for
is
the
peace
of us
-
having made
-
both
one
and
the
barrier
of the
fence
having broken down
the
hostility
in
the
flesh
of Him
the
law
-
of commandments
in
ordinances
having annulled
so that
the
two
He might create
in
Himself
into
one
new
man
making
peace
and
He might reconcile
-
both
in
one
body
-
to God
through
the
cross
having slain
the
hostility
by
it
And
having come
He proclaimed the gospel
peace
to you
the [ones]
far off
and
peace
to those
near
For
through
Him
we have
the
access
-
both
by
one
Spirit
to
the
Father
So
then
no longer
are you
strangers
and
aliens
but
are
fellow citizens
of the
saints
and
of the household
-
of God
having been built
upon
the
foundation
of the
apostles
and
prophets
being
[the] cornerstone
Himself
Christ
Jesus
in
whom
the whole
building
being fitted together
is increasing
into
a temple
holy
in
[the] Lord
in
whom
also
you
are being built together
for
a habitation
-
of God
in
[the] Spirit
Of this
for reason
I
Paul
the
prisoner
-
of Christ
Jesus
for
you
-
Gentiles
If
indeed
you have heard of
the
administration
of the
grace
-
of God
-
having been given
to me
toward
you
that
by
revelation
He made known
to me
the
mystery
just as
I have written before
in
brief
by
which
you are able
reading [it]
to understand
the
insight
of me
into
the
mystery
-
of Christ
which
in other
generations
not
was made known
to the
sons
-
of men
as
now
it has been revealed
to
holy
apostles
His
and
prophets
in
[the] Spirit
are
the
Gentiles
joint-heirs
and
a joint-body
and
joint-partakers
of the
promise
in
Christ
Jesus
through
the
gospel
of which
I became
servant
according to
the
gift
of the
grace
-
of God
-
having been given
to me
according to
the
working
of the
power
of Him
To me
the
very least
of all
saints
was given
the
grace
this
to the
Gentiles
to preach
the
unsearchable
riches
-
of Christ
and
to enlighten
what [is]
the
administration
of the
mystery
-
having been hidden
from
the
ages
in
-
God
the [One]
-
all things
having created
so that
should be made known
now
to the
rulers
and
the
authorities
in
the
heavenly realms
through
the
church
the
manifold
wisdom
-
of God
according to
[the] purpose
of the
ages
which
He accomplished
in
-
Christ
Jesus
the
Lord
of us
in
whom
we have
-
boldness
and
access
in
confidence
by
the
faith
from Him
Therefore
I implore [you]
not
to lose heart
at
the
tribulations
of me
for
you
which
is
glory
of you
... of this
for reason
I bow
the
knees
of me
to
the
Father
from
whom
every
family
in
[the] heavens
and
on
earth
is named
that
He might give
you
according to
the
riches
of the
glory
of Him
with power
to be strengthened
by
the
Spirit
of Him
in
the
inner
man
[for] to dwell
-
Christ
through
-
faith
in
the
hearts
of you
in
love
being rooted
and
being founded
so that
you may be fully able
to comprehend
with
all
the
saints
what [is]
the
breadth
and
length
and
height
and
depth
to know
then
the
surpassing
-
knowledge
love
-
of Christ
so that
you may be filled
unto
all
the
fullness
-
of God
To the [One]
now
being able
above
all things
to do
exceedingly
that
we ask
or
think
according to
the
power
-
working
in
us
to Him [be]
the
glory
in
the
church
and
in
Christ
Jesus
to
all
the
generations
of the
age
of the
ages
Amen
Exhort
therefore
you
I
the
prisoner
in
[the] Lord
worthily
to walk
of the
calling
to which
you were called
with
all
humility
and
gentleness
with
patience
bearing with
one another
in
love
being diligent
to keep
the
unity
of the
Spirit
in
the
bond
-
of peace
one
body
and
one
Spirit
just as
also
you were called
into
one
hope
of the
calling
of you
one
Lord
one
faith
one
baptism
one
God
and
Father
of all
who [is]
over
all
and
through
all
and
in
all
One
now
to each
of us
has been given
-
grace
according to
the
measure
of the
gift
-
of Christ
Therefore
it says
Having ascended
on
high
He led captive
captivity
gave
gifts
-
to men
-
And
He ascended
what
is
if
not
that
also
He descended
into
the
lower
regions
of the
earth
The [One]
having descended
the same
is
also
[one]
having ascended
above
all
the
heavens
so that
He might fill
-
all things
And
He
gave
some
indeed
[to be] apostles
some
now
prophets
some
now
evangelists
some
now
shepherds
and
teachers
toward
the
perfecting
of the
saints
for
[the] work
of ministry
for
[the] building up
of the
body
-
of Christ
until
we may attain
-
all
to
the
unity
of the
faith
and
of the
knowledge
of the
Son
-
of God
unto
a man
a complete
to
[the] measure
of [the] stature
of the
fullness
-
of Christ
so that
no longer
we might be
infants
being tossed by waves
and
being carried about
by every
wind
-
of teaching
in
the
cunning
-
of men
in
craftiness
with a view to
the
scheming
-
of deceit
Speaking the truth
however
in
love
we should grow up
into
Him
in
all things
who
is
the
head
Christ
from
whom
all
the
body
being joined together
and
being held together
by
every
ligament
of [its]
supply
according to
[the] working
in
[the] measure
individual
of each
part
the
increase
of the
body
makes for itself
to
[the] building up
of itself
in
love
This
therefore
I say
and
testify
in
[the] Lord
No longer
[are] you
to walk
as
also
the
Gentiles
are walking
in
[the] futility
of the
mind
of them
being darkened
in the
understanding
being
alienated from
the
life
-
of God
because of
the
ignorance
-
being
in
them
on account of
the
hardness
of the
heart
of them
who
having cast off all feeling
themselves
have given up
to
sensuality
for
[the] working
of impurity
all
with
greediness
You
however
not
this way
learned
-
Christ
if
indeed
Him
you have heard
and
in
Him
have been taught
just as
is
[the] truth
in
-
Jesus
Are to have put off
you
concerning
the
former
way of life
the
old
man
which
is being corrupted
according to
[its]
desires
-
of deceit
to be renewed
then
in the
spirit
of the
mind
of you
and
to have put on
the
new
man
-
according to
God
having been created
in
righteousness
and
holiness
-
of truth
Therefore
having put off
-
falsehood
let speak
truth
each one
with
the
neighbor
of him
because
we are
of one another
members
Be angry
and yet
not
sin
The
sun
not
let set
upon
anger
of you
neither
give
opportunity
to the
devil
The [one]
stealing
no longer
let him steal
rather
however
let him toil
working
with the
own
hands
what
[is] good
so that
he may have [something]
to impart
to the [one]
need
having
Any
word
unwholesome
out of
the
mouth
of you
not
let go forth
but
if
any
good
for
edification
of the
need
so that
it may give
grace
to those
hearing
And
not
grieve
the
Spirit
-
Holy
-
of God
in
whom
you were sealed
for
[the] day
of redemption
All
bitterness
and
rage
and
anger
and
clamor
and
slander
let be removed
from
you
along with
all
malice
Be
now
to
one another
kind
tender-hearted
forgiving
each other
as
also
-
God
in
Christ
forgave
you
Be
therefore
imitators
-
of God
as
children
beloved
and
walk
in
love
just as
also
-
Christ
loved
us
and
gave up
himself
for
us
[as] an offering
and
a sacrifice
-
to God
into
an aroma
of a sweet smell
Sexual immorality
however
and
impurity
all
or
covetousness
not even
let be named
among
you
as also
is proper
to saints
and
filthiness
and
foolish talking
or
crude joking
which
not
are fitting
but
rather
thanksgiving
This
for
you know
realizing
that
any
fornicator
or
unclean person
or
covetous man
who
is
an idolater
not
has
inheritance
in
the
kingdom
-
of Christ
and
of God
No one
you
let deceive
with empty
words
because of
these things
for
comes
the
wrath
-
of God
upon
the
sons
-
of disobedience
Not
therefore
be
partakers
with them
You were
for
once
darkness
now
however
light
in
[the] Lord
as
children
of light
walk
-
for
the fruit
of the
light [is]
in
all
goodness
and
righteousness
and
truth
discerning
what
is
well-pleasing
to the
Lord
And
not
have fellowship with
the
works
-
unfruitful
-
of darkness
rather
however
even
expose [them]
the things
for
in secret
being done
by
them
shameful
it is
even
to mention
-
But
everything
being exposed
by
the
light
is made visible
everything
for
-
becoming visible
light
is
Therefore
it says
Awake you
the [one]
sleeping
and
rise up
out from
the
dead
and
will shine upon
you
-
Christ
Take heed
therefore
carefully
how
you walk
not
as
unwise
but
as
wise
redeeming
the
time
because
the
days
evil
are
Because of
this
not
be
foolish
but
understand
what
the
will
of the
Lord [is]
And
not
to be drunk
with wine
in
which
is
debauchery
Instead
be filled
with
[the] Spirit
speaking
to each other
psalms
and
hymns
and
songs
spiritual
singing
and
making melody
in the
heart
of you
to the
Lord
giving thanks
at all times
for
all things
in
[the] name
the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
to the
God
and
Father
Be submitting yourselves
to one another
in
reverence
of Christ
-
wives
to the
own
husbands
as
to the
Lord
for
[the] husband
is
head
of the
wife
as
also
-
Christ
[is the] head
of the
church
He Himself
Savior
of the
body
But
even as
the
church
is subjected
-
to Christ
so
also
-
wives
to the own
husbands
in
everything
-
Husbands
love
the
wives
just as
also
-
Christ
loved
the
church
and
Himself
gave up
for
her
so that
her
He might sanctify
having cleansed [her]
by the
washing
-
of water
by
[the] word
so that
might present
He
to Himself
in glory
the
church
not
having
spot
or
wrinkle
or
any
of the
such things
but
that
it would be
holy
and
blameless
So
ought
also
-
husbands
to love
the
of themselves
wives
as
the
of themselves
bodies
The [one]
loving
the
of himself
wife
himself
loves
No one
for
at any time
the
of himself
flesh
hated
but
he nourishes
and
cherishes
it
just as
also [does]
-
Christ
the
church
for
members
we are
of the
body
of Him
Because of
this
will leave
a man
his
father
and
-
mother
and
be joined
to
the
wife
of him
and
will be
the
two
into
flesh
one
The
mystery
this
great
is
I
however
speak
as to
Christ
and
as to
the
church
However
also
you
-
according to
individual
each
the
of himself
wife
so
let love
as
himself
-
and
the wife
that
she may respect
the
husband
-
Children
obey
the
parents
of you
in
[the] Lord
this
for
is
right
Honor
the
Father
of you
and
-
mother
which
is
[the] commandment
first
with
a promise
that
well
with you
it may be
and
you will be
long-lived
upon
the
earth
And
-
fathers
not
provoke
the
children
of you
but
bring up
them
in
[the] discipline
and
admonition
of [the] Lord
-
Slaves
obey
the
according to
flesh
masters
with
fear
and
trembling
in
sincerity
of the
heart
of you
as
to
Christ
not
with
eye-service
as
men-pleasers
but
as
servants of
Christ
doing
the
will
-
of God
from
[the] heart
with
good will
rendering service
as
to the
Lord
and
not
to men
knowing
that
each one
if
whatever
he might have done
good
this
he will receive [back]
from
[the] Lord
whether
slave
or
free
And
-
masters
the same things
them
do
toward
them
giving up
the
threatening
knowing
that
also
of them
and
of you
the
master
is
in
[the] heavens
and
partiality
not
there is
with
Him
-
Henceforth
be empowered
in
[the] Lord
and
in
the
strength
of the
might
of Him
Put on
the
complete armor
-
of God
for
-
to be able
you
to stand
against
the
schemes
of the
devil
because
not
is
to us
the
wrestling
against
blood
and
flesh
but
against
the
rulers
against
the
authorities
against
the
cosmic powers
of the
darkness
this
against
the
spiritual [forces]
-
of evil
in
the
heavenly realms
Because of
this
take up
the
complete armor
-
of God
so that
you may be able
to withstand
in
the
day
-
evil
and
all things
having done
to stand
Stand
therefore
having girded
the
loins
of you
with
truth
and
having put on
the
breastplate
-
of righteousness
and
having shod
the
feet
with
[the] readiness
of the
gospel
-
of peace
besides
all
having taken up
the
shield
-
of faith
with
which
you will be able
all
the
arrows
of the
evil one
-
flaming
to quench
And
the
helmet
-
of salvation
take
and
the
sword
of the
Spirit
which
is
[the] word
of God
through
all
prayer
and
supplication
praying
in
every
season
in
[the] Spirit
and
unto
this very thing
watching
with
all
perseverance
and
supplication
for
all
-
saints
and also
for
me
that
to me
may be given
divine utterance
in
[the] opening
of the
mouth
of me
with
boldness
to make known
the
mystery
of the
gospel
for
which
I am an ambassador
in
a chain
that
in
it
I may be bold
as
it behooves
me
to speak
That
now
may know
also
you
the things
concerning
me
what
I am doing
all things
will make known
to you
Tychicus
the
beloved
brother
and
faithful
servant
in
[the] Lord
whom
I have sent
to
you
for
this very
purpose
that
you may know
the things
concerning
us
and
he may encourage
the
hearts
of you
Peace
to the
brothers
and
love
with
faith
from
God
[the] Father
and
[the] Lord
Jesus
Christ
-
Grace
[be] with
all
those
loving
the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
in
incorruptibility
Paul

Timothy

To all
the

being
in
Philippi
with
[the] overseers

Grace
to you

the
God
of me
upon
every
-
remembrance
of you
always
in
every
supplication
of me
for
all
of you
with
joy
the
supplication
making
for
the
partnership
of you
in
the
gospel
from
the
first
day
until
-
now
being persuaded of
[the] very thing
this
that
the [One]
having begun
in
you
a work
good
will complete [it]
until
[the] day
of Christ
Jesus
Accordingly
it is
right
for me
this
to feel
about
all
of you
since
-
have
I
in
the
heart
you
in
both
the
chains
of me
and
in
the
defense
and
confirmation
of the
gospel
fellow partakers
with me
of
grace
all
you
are
Witness
for
my
-
God [is]
how
I long after
all
you
in
[the] affection
of Christ
Jesus
And
this
I pray
that
the
love
of you
yet
more
and
more
may abound
in
knowledge
and
all
discernment
for
-
to approve
you
the things
being excellent
so that
you may be
pure
and
blameless
unto
[the] day
of Christ
being filled
with [the] fruit
of righteousness
that [is]
through
Jesus
Christ
to
[the] glory
and
praise
of God
To know
now
you
I want
brothers
that
the things
concerning
me
really
to
[the] advancement
of the
gospel
have turned out
so as for
the
chains
of me
clearly known
in
Christ
to have become
in
all
the
palace guard
and
to the
rest
all
and
-
most
of the
brothers
in
[the] Lord
trusting
by the
chains
of me
more abundantly
to dare
fearlessly
the
word
of
God
to speak
Some
indeed
even
from
envy
and
strife
some
however
also
from
goodwill
-
Christ
are proclaiming
the [ones]
indeed
out of
love
knowing
that
for
defense
of the
gospel
I am appointed
the [ones]
however
out of
selfish ambition
-
Christ
are proclaiming
not
purely
supposing
tribulation
to add
to the
chains
of me
What
then
Only
that
in every
way
whether
in pretext
or
in truth
Christ
is proclaimed
And
in
this
I rejoice
Yes
and
I will rejoice
I know
for
that
this
for me
will turn out
to
deliverance
through
-
your
prayer
and
[the] provision
of the
Spirit
of Jesus
Christ
according to
the
earnest expectation
and
hope
of me
that
in
nothing
I will be ashamed
but
in
all
boldness
as
always
also
now
will be magnified
Christ
in
the
body
of me
whether
by
life
or
by
death
To me
for
-
to live
[is] Christ
and
-
to die
[is] gain
If [I am]
however
-
to live
in
flesh
this
for me
[is the] fruit
of labor
And
what
shall I choose
Not
I know
I am pressed
however
between
the
two
the
desire
having
for [myself]
-
to depart
and
with
Christ
to be
very much
for
more
better
-
but
to remain
the
flesh
[is] more necessary
for the sake of
you
And
this
having been persuaded of
I know
that
I will remain
and
will continue with
all
of you
for
-
your
progress
and
joy
of the
faith
so that
the
boasting
of you
may abound
to
Christ
Jesus
in
me
through
-
my
coming
again
to
you
Only
worthily
of the
gospel
-
of Christ
conduct yourselves
so that
whether
having come
and
having seen
you
or
being absent
I might hear
the things
concerning
you
that
you are standing firm
in
one
spirit
with one
mind
striving together
for the
faith
of the
gospel
and
not
being frightened
in
nothing
by
those
opposing [you]
which
is
to them
a demonstration
of destruction
to you
however
of salvation
and
this
from
God
For
to you
it has been granted
-
concerning
Christ
not
only
-
in
Him
to believe
but
also
-
concerning
Him
to suffer
the
same
conflict
having
such as
you saw
in
me
and
now
hear of
in
me
If [there is]
any
therefore
encouragement
in
Christ
if
any
comfort
of love
if
any
fellowship
of [the] Spirit
if
any
affections
and
compassions
fulfill
my
-
joy
so that
the
same
you may be minded
the
same
love
having
united in soul
the
same thing
minding
nothing
according to
self-interest
or
according to
vain conceit
but
-
in humility
one another
be esteeming
surpassing
themselves
not
the things
of themselves
each
considering
but
also
the things
of others
each
This
let mind be
in
you
which
also
in
Christ
Jesus [was]
Who
in
[the] form
of God
existing
not
something to be grasped
considered
-
to be
equal
with God
but
Himself
emptied
[the] form
of a servant
having taken
in
[the] likeness
of men
having been made
And
in appearance
having been found
as
a man
He humbled
Himself
having become
obedient
unto
death
[the] death
even
of [the] cross
Therefore
also
-
God
Him
highly exalted
and
granted
to Him
the
name
-
above
every
name
that
at
the
name
of Jesus
every
knee
should bow
in the heavens
and
on earth
and
under the earth
and
every
tongue
should confess
that
[is] Lord
Jesus
Christ
to
[the] glory
of God
[the] Father
Therefore
beloved
of me
just as
always
you have obeyed
not
as
in
the
presence
of me
only
but
now
much
more
in
the
absence
of me
with
fear
and
trembling
-
your own
salvation
work out
God
for
is
the [One]
working
in
you
both
-
to will
and
-
to work
according to
[His]
good pleasure
All things
do
without
murmurings
and
disputings
so that
you may be
blameless
and
innocent
children
of God
unblemished
in [the] midst
of a generation
crooked
and
perverted
among
whom
you shine
as
lights
in
[the] world
[the] word
of life
holding forth
unto
a boast
to me
in
[the] day
of Christ
that
not
in
vain
I did run
nor
in
vain
toil
But
if
even
I am being poured out as a drink offering
on
the
sacrifice
and
service
of the
faith
of you
I am glad
and
rejoice with
all
you
-
And
likewise
also
you
be glad
and
rejoice with
me
I hope
however
in
[the] Lord
Jesus
Timothy
soon
to send
to you
that
I also
may be encouraged
having known
the things
concerning
you
No one
for
I have
like-minded
who
genuinely
the things
relative to
you
will care for
Those
all
for
the things
of themselves
are seeking
not
the things
of Christ
Jesus
-
But
the proven worth
of him
you know
that
as
a father [with]
a child
with
me
he has served
in
the
gospel
Him
indeed
therefore
I hope
to send
when
-
I shall have seen
the things
concerning
me
immediately
I am persuaded
now
in
[the] Lord
that
also
I myself
soon
I will come
Necessary
now
I esteemed [it]
Epaphroditus
the
brother
and
fellow worker
and
fellow soldier
of me
of you
now
messenger
and
minster
of the
need
of me
to send
to
you
since
longing after
he was
all
you
and
being deeply distressed
because
you heard
that
he was ill
And
indeed
he was sick
nearly
unto death
but
-
God
had mercy on
him
not
on him
now
alone
but
also
on me
that
not
sorrow
upon
sorrow
I should have
All the more speedily
therefore
I have sent
him
that
having seen
him
again
you may rejoice
and I
less anxious
might be
Receive
therefore
him
in
[the] Lord
with
all
joy
and
-
such
in honor
hold
because
for the sake of
the
work
of Christ
unto
death
he came near
having disregarded
[his]
life
so that
he might fill up
the
of you
deficit
of
toward
me
service
-
Finally
brothers
of me
rejoice
in
[the] Lord
The
same things
to write
to you
to me
indeed
[is] not
troublesome
for you
now
[is] safe
Beware of
the
dogs
beware of
the
evil
workers
beware of
the
false circumcision
We
for
are
the
circumcision
those
in [the] Spirit
of God
worshiping
and
glorying
in
Christ
Jesus
and
not
in
[the] flesh
having put confidence
though
I
have
confidence
even
in
[the] flesh
If
any
thinks
other
to have confidence
in
[the] flesh
I
more
circumcision
on [the] eighth day
of
[the] nation
of Israel
of [the] tribe
of Benjamin
a Hebrew
of
Hebrews
according to
[the] Law
a Pharisee
according to
zeal
persecuting
the
church
according to
righteousness
which [is]
in
[the] Law
having become
faultless
But
whatever things
were
to me
gain
these
I have esteemed
because of
-
Christ
loss
But
-
therefore
indeed
also
I count
all things
loss
to be
because of
the
excelling
-
knowledge
of Christ
Jesus
the
Lord
of me
because of
whom
-
all things
I have lost
and
esteem [them]
rubbish
that
Christ
I may gain
and
be found
in
Him
not
having
my own
righteousness
which [is]
of
[the] Law
but
that
through
faith
from Christ
the
of
God
righteousness
on the basis of
-
faith
-
to know
Him
and
the
power
of the
resurrection
of Him
and
fellowship
sufferings
of Him
being conformed
to the
death
of Him
if
by any means
I may attain
to
the
resurrection
-
out from
dead
Not
that
already
I have obtained [it]
or
already
have been perfected
I am pursuing
however
if
also
I may lay hold
of
that for which
also
I was laid hold of
by
Christ
Jesus
Brothers
I
myself
not
do consider
to have taken hold [of it]
One thing
however
The things
indeed
behind
forgetting
to the things
now
ahead
reaching forward
toward
[the] goal
I press on
for
the
prize
of the
upward
calling
-
of God
in
Christ
Jesus
As many as
therefore
[are] mature
this
should be of mind
and
if [in]
anything
differently
you are minded
even
this
-
God
to you
will reveal
Nevertheless
to
that which
we have attained
by the
same
to walk
Imitators together
of me
be
brothers
and
observe
those
thus
walking
as
you have
[for] a pattern
us
Many
for
are walking
[of] whom
often
I told
you
now
indeed
even
weeping
I say
-
[as] enemies
of the
cross
-
of Christ
whose
-
end [is]
destruction
whose
-
God [is]
the
belly
and
-
glory
[is] in
the
shame
of them
those
things
earthly
minding
Of us
for
the
citizenship
in
[the] heavens
exists
from
whence
also
a Savior
we are awaiting
[the] Lord
Jesus
Christ
who
will transform
the
body
-
of humiliation
of us
conformed
to the
body
of the
glory
of Himself
according to
the
working
-
enabling
Him
even
to subdue
to Himself
-
all things
Therefore
brothers
of me
beloved
and
longed for
[the] joy
and
crown
of me
in this way
stand firm
in
[the] Lord
beloved
Euodia
I exhort
and
Syntyche
I exhort
the
same
to be of mind
in
[the] Lord
Yes
I ask
also
you
true
yokefellow
help
these [women]
who
in
the
gospel
labored together
with me
with
also
Clement
and
the
rest
of [the] fellow workers
of me
whose
-
names [are]
in
[the] book
of life
Rejoice
in
[the] Lord
always
again
I will say
rejoice
The
gentleness
of you
let be known
to all
men
The
Lord
[is] near
Nothing
be anxious about
but
in
everything
by
prayer
and
-
supplication
with
thanksgiving
the
requests
of you
let be made known
to
-
God
And
the
peace
-
of God
-
surpassing
all
understanding
will guard
the
hearts
of you
and
the
minds
of you
in
Christ
Jesus
-
Finally
brothers
whatever
is
true
whatever
venerable
whatever
right
whatever
pure
whatever
lovely
whatever
admirable
if
any
excellence
and
if
any
praise
these things
think on
What
also
you have learned
and
have received
and
have heard
and
have seen
in
me
these things
practice
and
the
God
-
of peace
will be
with
you
I rejoiced
however
in
[the] Lord
greatly
that
now
at last
you revived
the
for
me
caring
wherein
which
also
you were concerned
you were lacking opportunity
however
Not
that
as to
destitution
I speak
I
for
have learned
in
that which
I am
content
to be
I know
also
[how] to be brought low
I know
also
[how] to abound
In
everything
and
in
all things
I have learned the secret
also
to be full
and
to hunger
also
to abound
and
to be deficient
[For] all things
I have strength
in
the [One]
strengthening
me
But
well
you did
having fellowship in
my
-
affliction
Know
now
also
you
Philippians
that
in
[the] beginning
of the
gospel
when
I went out
from
Macedonia
not one
with me
church
had partnership
with regard to
the matter
of giving
and
receiving
if
not
you
alone
For
even
in
Thessalonica
both
once
and
twice
for
the
needs
of me
you sent
Not
that
I seek after
the
gift
but
I seek after
the
fruit
-
abounding
to
[the] account
of you
I have
however
all things
and
abound
I am full
having received
from
Epaphroditus
the things
from
you
an odor
of a sweet smell
a sacrifice
acceptable
well-pleasing
-
to God
-
And
[the] God
of me
will fill up
all
[the] needs
of you
according to
the
riches
of Him
in
glory
in
Christ
Jesus
To
now
[the] God
and
Father
of us [is]
[be] the
glory
to
the
ages
of the

of the
saints
in
the
light
who
has delivered
us
from
the
dominion
-
of darkness
and
transferred [us]
into
the
kingdom
of the
Son
-
beloved
of Him
in
whom
we have
-
redemption
the
forgiveness
-
of sins
[He]
is
[the] image
of the
God
-
invisible
[the] firstborn
over all
creation
because
in
Him
were created
-
all things
in
the
heavens
and
upon
the
earth
the
visible
and
the
invisible
whether
thrones
or
dominions
or
rulers
or
authorities
-
all things
through
Him
and
unto
Him
have been created
And
He
is
before
all things
and
-
all things
in
Him
hold together
And
He
is
the
head
of the
body
the
church
who
is
beginning
firstborn
out from
the
dead
so that
might be
in
all things
He
holding preeminence
because
in
Him
was pleased
all
the
fullness
to dwell
and
by
Him
to reconcile
-
all things
to
Himself
having made peace
by
the
blood
of the
cross
of Him
through
Him
whether
the things
on
the
earth
or
the things
in
the
heavens
And
you
once
being
alienated
and
hostile
-
in mind
in
the
deeds
-
evil
now
however
He has reconciled [You]
in
the
body
of the
flesh
of Him
through
-
death
to present
you
holy
and
unblemished
and
blameless
before
Him
if
indeed
you continue
-
in the faith
established
and
firm
and
not
being moved away
from
the
hope
of the
gospel
that
you have heard
-
having been proclaimed
in
all
creation
-
under
-
heaven
of which
have become
I
Paul
a minister
Now
I rejoice
in
the
sufferings
for
you
and
I am filling up
that which
is lacking
of the
tribulations
-
of Christ
in
the
flesh
of me
for
the
body
of Him
which
is
the
church
of which
became
I
a minister
according to
the
administration
-
of God
-
having been given
me
toward
you
to complete
the
word
-
of God
the
mystery
-
having been hidden
from
the
ages
and
from
the
generations
now
however
having been manifested
to the
saints
of Him
to whom
has willed
-
God
to make known
what [is]
the
riches
of the
glory
of the
mystery
this
among
the
Gentiles
which
is
Christ
in
you
the
hope
-
of glory
whom
we
preach
admonishing
every
man
and
teaching
every
man
in
all
wisdom
so that
we may present
every
man
perfect
in
Christ
Unto
this
also
I toil
striving
according to
the
energy
of Him
-
working
in
me
in
power
I want
for
you
to know
how great
a struggle
I am having
for
you
and
those
in
Laodicea
and
as many as
not
have seen
the
face
of me
in
[the] flesh
that
may be encouraged
the
hearts
of them
having been knit together
in
love
and
to
all
[the] riches
of the
full assurance
-
of understanding
to
[the] knowledge
of the
mystery
-
of God
[which is] Christ
in
whom
are
all
the
treasures
-
of wisdom
and
of knowledge
hidden
This
I say
so that
no one
you
might delude
by
persuasive speech
If
truly
indeed
in the
flesh
I am absent
yet
-
in spirit
with
you
I am
rejoicing
and
seeing
your
-
good order
and
the
firmness
of the
in
Christ
faith
of you
Just as
therefore
you have received
-
Christ
Jesus
the
Lord
in
Him
walk
having been rooted
and
being built up
in
Him
and
being strengthened in
the
faith
just as
you were taught
abounding
with
thanksgiving
Take heed
lest
anyone
you
there will be
-
taking captive
through
-
philosophy
and
empty
deceit
according to
the
tradition
-
of men
according to
the
principles
of the
world
and
not
according to
Christ
For
in
Him
dwells
all
the
fullness
of the
Deity
bodily
and
you are
in
Him
complete
who
is
the
head
of all
rule
and
authority
in
whom
also
you were circumcised
with [the] circumcision
made without hands
in
the
removal
of the
body
of the
flesh
in
the
circumcision
-
of Christ
having been buried with
Him
in
-
baptism
in
which
also
you were raised with [Him]
through
the
faith
of the
working
-
of God
the [One]
having raised
Him
out from
the dead
And
you
dead
being
the
trespasses
and
in the
uncircumcision
of the
flesh
of you
He made alive together
you
with
Him
having forgiven
us
all
the
transgressions
having blotted out
the
against
us
handwriting
in the
decrees
which
was
adverse
to us
and
it
He has taken
out of
the
way
having nailed
it
to the
cross
Having disarmed
the
rulers
and
the
authorities
He made a show [of them]
in
public
having triumphed
over them
in
it
Not
therefore
anyone
you
let judge
in regard to
food
or
in regard to
drink
or
in
regard
to a feast
or
a New Moon
or
Sabbaths
which
are
a shadow
the things
coming
the
however
body [is]
-
of Christ
No one
you
let disqualify
delighting
in
humility
and
[the] worship
of the
angels
which
he has seen
detailing
vainly
being puffed up
by
the
mind
of the
flesh
of him
and
not
holding fast
to the
head
from
whom
all
the
body
by
the
joints
and
ligaments
being supplied
and
being knit together
increases
with the
increase
-
of God
If
you have died
with
Christ
away from
the
principles
of the
world
why
as if
living
in
[the] world
do you submit to decrees
Not
you should handle
Not
you should taste
Not
you should touch
which
are
all
unto
decay
with the
use
according to
the
commandments
and
teachings
-
of men
which
are
an appearance
indeed
having
of wisdom
in
self-imposed worship
and
humility
and
harsh treatment
of [the] body
not
of
honor
a certain
against
[the] indulgence
of the
flesh
If
then
you have been raised with
-
Christ
the things
above
seek
where
-
Christ
is
at [the]
right hand
-
of God
sitting
The things
above
set [your] minds on
not
the things
on
the
earth
You have died
for
and
the
life
of you
has been hidden
with
-
Christ
in
-
God
When
-
Christ
may be revealed
the
life
of you
then
also
you
with
Him
will appear
in
glory
Put to death
therefore
the
members
which [are]
upon
the
earth
sexual immorality
impurity
passion
desire
evil
and
-
covetousness
which
is
idolatry
because of
which things
is coming
the
wrath
-
of God
in
which
also
you
walked
once
when
you were living
in
them
Now
however
put off
also
you
-
all [these] things
anger
rage
malice
slander
foul language
out of
the
mouth
of you
Not
do lie
to
one another
having put off
the
old
man
with
the
practices
of him
and
having put on
the
new
the [one]
being renewed
in
knowledge
according to
[the] image
of the [one]
having created
him
where
not
there is
Greek
and
Jew
circumcision
and
uncircumcision
Barbarian
Scythian
slave
free
but
all
and
in
all
Christ [is]
Put on
therefore
as
[the] elect
-
of God
holy
and
beloved
hearts
of compassion
kindness
humility
gentleness
[and] patience
bearing with
each other
and
forgiving
each other
If
anyone
against
another
should have
a complaint
even as
also
the
Lord
has forgiven
you
so
also
you
Beyond
all
now
these
[put on] the
love
which
is
[the] bond
-
of perfect unity
And
the
peace
-
from Christ
let rule
in
the
hearts
of you
to
which
also
you were called
in
one
body
And
thankful
be
The
word
-
of Christ
let dwell
in
you
richly
in
all
wisdom
teaching
and
admonishing
each other
in psalms
hymns
[and] songs
spiritual
with
-
grace
singing
in
the
hearts
of you
to
God
And
everything
which
what
if
you might do
in
word
or
in
deed
all
in
[the] name
of [the] Lord
Jesus
giving thanks
-
to God
[the] Father
through
Him
-
Wives
submit yourselves
to the
husbands
as
is fitting
in
[the] Lord
-
Husbands
love
the
wives
and
not
be harsh
toward
them
-
Children
obey
the
parents
in
all things
this
for
pleasing
is
in
[the] Lord
-
Fathers
not
do provoke
the
children
of you
that
not
they might become discouraged
-
Slaves
obey
in
all things
the
according to
flesh
masters
not
with
eye-services
as
men-pleasers
but
in
sincerity
of heart
fearing
the
Lord
Whatever
if
you might do
from
[the] soul
work
as
to the
Lord
and
not
to men
knowing
that
from
[the] Lord
you will receive
the
reward
of the
inheritance
The
Lord
Christ
you serve
The [one]
for
doing wrong
will be repaid [for]
what
he has done wrong
and
not
there is
partiality
-
Masters
that which
[is] righteous
and
that which
[is] equal
to the
slaves
give
knowing
that
also
you
have
a Master
in
heaven
-
In prayer
continue steadfastly
watching
in
it
with
thanksgiving
praying
at the same time
also
for
us
that
-
God
may open
to us
a door
for the
word
to declare
the
mystery
-
of Christ
on account of
which
also
I have been bound
so that
I should make clear
it
as
it behooves
me
to speak
In
wisdom
walk
toward
those
outside

before
the

and
Father
of us
knowing
brothers
beloved
by
-
God
the
election
of you
because
the
gospel
of us
not
came
to
you
in
word
only
but
also
in
power
and
in
[the] Spirit
Holy
and
full assurance
much
just as
you know
what
we were
among
you
on account of
you
And
you
imitators
of us
became
and
of the
Lord
having received
the
word
in
tribulation
much
with
[the] joy
of [the] Spirit
Holy
so as for
to became
you
an example
to all
the
believing [ones]
in
-
Macedonia
and
in
-
Achaia
From
you
for
has sounded forth
the
word
of the
Lord
not
only
in
-
Macedonia
and
Achaia
but
in
every
place
the
faith
of you
-
toward
-
God
has gone abroad
so as for
no
need
to have
us
to say
anything
They themselves
for
concerning
us
report
what
reception
we had
from
you
and
how
you turned
to
-
God
from
-
idols
to serve
[the] God
living
and
true
and
to await
the
Son
of Him
from
the
heavens
whom
He raised
out from
the
dead
Jesus
the [one]
delivering
us
from
the
wrath
-
coming
You yourselves
for
know
brothers
the
coming
of us
-
to
you
that
not
in vain
has been
but
having previously suffered
and
having been mistreated
just as
you know
in
Philippi
we had boldness
in
the
God
of us
to speak
to
you
the
gospel
-
of God
amid
much
conflict
-
For
the exhortation
of us
[is] not
of
error
nor
of
impurity
nor
in
trickery
but
just as
we have been approved
by
-
God
to be entrusted with
the
gospel
so
we speak
not
as
men
pleasing
but
God
the [One]
examining
the
hearts
of us
Never
for
at any time
with
word
of flattery
were we
just as
you know
nor
with
a pretext
for greed
God [is]
witness
nor
seeking
from
men
glory
nor
from
you
nor
from
others
[though] having authority
with
weight
to be
as
Christâs
apostles
But
we were
gentle
in
[the] midst
of you
as
if
a nursing mother
would cherish
-
her own
children
So
yearning over
you
we were pleased
to have imparted
to you
not
only
the
gospel
-
of God
but
also
our
own
lives
because
beloved
to us
you have become
You remember
for
brothers
the
labor
of us
and
-
hardship
Night
and
day
working
in order
-
not
to burden
anyone
of you
we proclaimed
to
you
the
gospel
-
of God
You [are]
witnesses
and
-
God
how
holily
and
righteously
and
blamelessly
toward you
those
believing
we were
just as
you know
how
one
each
of you
as
a father
children
his own
exhorting
you
and
comforting
and
charging
unto
-
to walk
you
worthily
-
of God
who
calls
you
into
the
of Himself
kingdom
and
glory
And
because of
this
also
we
give thanks
-
to God
unceasingly
that
having received
[the] word
[by your] hearing
from
us
-
of God
you accepted
not
[the] word
of men
but
even as
truly
it is
[the] word
of God
which
also
works
in
you
who
believe
You
for
imitators
became
brothers
of the
churches
-
of God
-
being
in
-
Judea
in
Christ
Jesus
For
the same
as them
suffered
also
you
from
the
own
countrymen
as
also [did]
they
from
the
Jews
who
both
the
Lord
having killed
Jesus
and
their own
prophets
and
us
having driven out
and
God
not
pleasing
and
all
men
[who are] set against
hindering
us
to the
Gentiles
to speak
that
they might be saved
so as
-
to fill up
their
-
sins
always
Has come
now
upon
them
the
wrath
to the
utmost
We
however
brothers
having been bereaved
of
you
for
[the] time
of an hour
in face
not
in heart
more abundantly
were eager
the
face
of you
to see
with
great
desire
Therefore
we wanted
to come
to
you
I
indeed
Paul
both
once
and
twice
and
hindered
us
-
Satan
Who [is]
for
our
hope
or
joy
or
crown
of boasting
Or
[are] not
even
you
before
the
Lord
of us
Jesus
at
-
His
coming
You
for
are
the
glory
of us
and
-
joy
Therefore
no longer
enduring
we thought it best
to be left behind
in
Athens
alone
and
we sent
Timothy
the
brother
of us
and
fellow worker
-
of God
in
the
gospel
-
of Christ
in order
-
to strengthen
you
and
to encourage
concerning
the
faith
of you
that
no one
be moved
in
the
tribulations
these
Yourselves
for
you know
that
for
this
we are destined
And
indeed
when
with
you
we were
we were telling beforehand
you
that
we are about
to suffer affliction
just as
also
it came to pass
and
you know
Because of
this
I also
no longer
enduring
sent
in order
-
to know
the
faith
of you
lest
somehow
had tempted
you
the [one]
tempting
and
in
vain
would be
the
labor
of us
Presently
however
having come
Timothy
to
us
from
you
and
having brought good news
to us
of the
faith
and
the
love
of you
and
that
you have
a remembrance
of us
good
always
longing
us
to see
just as
also
we
you
because of
this
we were encouraged
brothers
as to
you
in
all
the
distress
and
tribulation
of us
through
-
your
faith
For
now
we live
if
you
are standing firm
in
[the] Lord
What
for
thanksgiving
are we able
-
to God
to give
concerning
you
in return for
all
the
joy
that
we rejoice
because of
you
before
the
God
of us
night
and
day
exceedingly
imploring
for [us]
-
to see
your
-
face
and
to supply
the things
lacking
in the
faith
of you
Himself
now
the
God
and
Father
of us
and
the
Lord
of us
Jesus
may direct
the
way
of us
to
you
You
now
the
Lord
may make to increase
and
to abound
-
in love
toward
one another
and
toward
all
just as
also
we
toward
you
in order
-
to strengthen
your
-
hearts
blameless
in
holiness
before
the
God
and
Father
of us
at
the
coming
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
with
all
the
saints
of Him
Finally
then
brothers
we implore
you
and
exhort
in
[the] Lord
Jesus
that
just as
you have received
from
us
-
in what manner
it behooves
you
to walk
and
to please
God
just as
even
you walk [now]
so
you should abound
more
You know
for
what
instructions
we gave
you
through
the
Lord
Jesus
This
for
is
[the] will
-
of God
the
sanctification
of you
To abstain
you [are]
from
-
sexual immorality
to know
each
of you [how]
the
of himself
vessel
to control
in
holiness
and
honor
not
in
[the] passion
of lust
as
also
the
Gentiles
-
not
knowing
-
God
-
not
to go beyond
and
to overreach
in
the
matter
the
brother
of him
because
avenging [is]
[the] Lord
concerning
all
these things
just as
also
we told before
you
and
thoroughly warned
Not
for
has called
us
-
God
to
impurity
but
into
holiness
So then
the [one]
rejecting [this]
not
man
disregards
but
-
God
the [One]
also
giving
the
Spirit
of Him
-
Holy
to
you
Concerning
now
-
brotherly love
no
need
you have [for me]
to write
to you
yourselves
for
you
taught by God
are
in order
-
to love
one another
And
for
you are doing
this
toward
all
the
brothers
in
all
-
Macedonia
We exhort
however
you
brothers
to abound
more and more
and
to strive earnestly
to live quietly
and
to attend to
the
own
and
to work with
the
hands
of you
just as
you
we commanded
so that
you may walk
properly
toward
those
outside
and
of no one
need
may have
Not
we do want
but
you
to be ignorant
brothers
concerning
those
having fallen asleep
so that
not
you should be grieved
just as
also
the
rest
those
not
having
hope
If
for
we believe
that
Jesus
died
and
rose again
so
also
-
God
those
having fallen asleep
through
-
Jesus
will bring
with
Him
This
for
to you
we declare
in
[the] word
of [the] Lord
that
we
the
living
-
remaining
unto
the
coming
of the
Lord
no
not
shall precede
those
having fallen asleep
because
Himself
the
Lord
with
a loud command
with
the voice
of an archangel
and
with
[the] trumpet
of God
will descend
from
heaven
and
the
dead
in
Christ
will rise
first
Then
we
the
living
-
remaining
together
with
them
will be caught away
in
[the] clouds
for
[the] meeting
of the
Lord
in
[the] air
and
so
always
with
[the] Lord
we will be
Therefore
encourage
one another
with
the
words
these
Concerning
now
the
times
and
the
seasons
brothers
no
need
you have
to you
to be written
Yourselves
for
fully
you know
that
[the] day
of [the] Lord
as
a thief
by
night
in this manner
comes
For when
they might say
Peace
and
security
then
suddenly
upon them
comes
destruction
as
the
labor pains
to her
in
womb
having
and
no
not
shall they escape
You
however
brothers
not
are
in
darkness
that
the
day
you
like
a thief
should overtake
All
for
you
sons
of light
are
and
sons
of day
Not
we are
of night
nor
of darkness
So
then
not
we should sleep
as
the
others
but
we should watch
and
we should be sober
Those
for
sleeping
by night
sleep
and
those
becoming drunk
by night
get drunk
We
however
of [the] day
being
should be sober
having put on
[the] breastplate
of faith
and
love
and
[the] helmet
[the] hope
of salvation
because
not
has destined
us
-
God
for
wrath
but
for
obtaining
salvation
through
the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
the [One]
having died
for
us
so that
whether
we might watch
or
we might sleep
together
with
Him
we may live
Therefore
encourage
one another
and
build up
one
-
another
just as
also
you are doing
We implore
however
you
brothers
to appreciate
those
toiling
among
you
and
taking the lead
over you
in
[the] Lord
and
admonishing
you
and
to esteem
them
exceedingly
in
love
because of
the
work
of them
Be at peace
among
yourselves
We exhort
now
you
brothers
to admonish
the
unruly
encourage
the
fainthearted
help
the
weak
be patient
toward
all
See that
no
one
evil
for
evil
to anyone
has repaid
but
always
the
good
pursue
toward
one another
and
toward
all
Always
rejoice
Unceasingly
pray
In
everything
give thanks
this
for
[is the] will
of God
in
Christ
Jesus
toward
you
The
Spirit
not
do quench
Prophecies
not
do despise
All things
however
test
To the
good
hold fast
From
every
form
of evil
abstain
Himself
now
the
God
-
of peace
may sanctify
you
completely
and
entirely
your
-
spirit
and
-
soul
and
-
body
blameless
at
the
coming
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
may be preserved
[Is] faithful
the [One]
calling
you
who
also
will do [it]
Brothers
pray
for
us
Greet
the
brothers
all
with
a kiss
holy
I adjure
you
[by] the
Lord
to be read
[this]
letter
to all
the
brothers
The
grace
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
[be] with
you
Paul
and
Silvanus
and
Timothy
To the
church
of [the] Thessalonians
in
God
[the] Father
of us
and
the Lord
Jesus
Christ
Grace
to you
and
peace
from
God
[the] Father
and
the Lord
Jesus
Christ
To thank
we ought
-
God
always
concerning
you
brothers
just as
fitting
it is
because
is increasing exceedingly
the
faith
of you
and
is abounding
the
love
of one
each
of all
you
to
one another
so as for
ourselves
us
in
you
to boast
in
the
churches
-
of God
about
the
perseverance
of you
and
faith
in
all
the
persecutions
of you
and
in the
tribulations
that
you are bearing
[This is] a plain token
of the
righteous
judgment
-
of God
unto
-
to be accounted worthy
you
of the
kingdom
-
of God
for
which
also
you suffer
For indeed
righteous [it is]
with
God
to repay
those
oppressing
you
with affliction
and
to you
-
being oppressed
repose
with
us
at
the
revelation
of the
Lord
Jesus
from
heaven
with
[the] angels
mighty
of Him
in
a fire
of flame
inflicting
vengeance
on those
not
knowing
God
and
on those
not
obeying
the
gospel
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
who
[the] penalty
will suffer
of destruction
eternal
away from
[the] presence
of the
Lord
and
from
the
glory
of the
power
of Him
when
He shall come
to be glorified
in
the
saints
of Him
and
to be marveled at
among
all
those
having believed
because
was believed
the
testimony
of us
to
you
in
the
day
that
for
which
also
we pray
always
for
you
that
you
He may count worthy
of the
calling
of the
God
of us
and
He may fulfill
every
good pleasure
of goodness
and
work
of faith
with
power
so that
may be glorified
the
name
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
in
you
and
you
in
Him
according to
the
grace
of the
God
of us
and
[the] Lord
Jesus
Christ
We implore
now
you
brothers
by
the
coming
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
and
our
gathering together
unto
Him
for
-
not
quickly
to be shaken
you
in
-
mind
nor
to be troubled
neither
by
spirit
nor
by
word
nor
by
letter
as if
by
us
as
that
is present
the
day
of the
Lord
No
one
you
should deceive
in
not one
way
because [it is]
if
not [until]
shall have come
the
apostasy
first
and
shall have been revealed
the
man
-
of lawlessness
the
son
-
of destruction
the [one]
opposing
and
exalting himself
above
every
so-called
god
or
object of worship
so as for
him
in
the
temple
-
of God
to sit down
setting forth
he himself
that
is
God
Not
do you remember
that
yet
being
with
you
these things
I was saying
to you
And
now
that which
is restraining
you know
for
-
to be revealed
him
in
-
his
time
The
for
mystery
already
is working
-
of lawlessness
only [there is]
the [one]
restraining [it]
at present
until
out of
[the] midst
he might be [gone]
And
then
will be revealed
the
lawless [one]
whom
the
Lord
Jesus
will slay
with the
breath
of the
mouth
of Him
and
will annul
by the
appearing
of the
coming
of Him
whose
is
-
coming
according to
[the] working
-
of Satan
in
every
power
and
in signs
and
in wonders
of falsehood
and
in
every
deceit
of wickedness
unto those
perishing
in return for
which
the
love
of the
truth
not
they received
in order for
-
to be saved
them
And
because of
this
will send
to them
-
God
a working
of delusion
for
-
to believe
them
what
[is] false
in order that
should be judged
all
those
not
having believed
the
truth
but
having delighted
-
in unrighteousness
We
however
ought
to give thanks
-
to God
always
concerning
you
brothers
beloved
by
[the] Lord
that
has chosen
you
-
God
from
[the] beginning
unto
salvation
in
[the] sanctification
of [the] Spirit
and
[by] faith
of [the] truth
to
this
also
He called
you
through
the
gospel
of us
to
[the] obtaining
of [the] glory
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
So
then
brothers
stand firm
and
hold fast
to the
traditions
that
you were taught
whether
by
word
or
by
letter
from us
Himself
now
the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
and
-
God
the
Father
of us
the [One]
having loved
us
and
having given [us]
comfort
eternal
and
hope
good
by
grace
may He encourage
your
-
hearts
and
may He strengthen [them]
in
every
work
and
word
good
-
Finally
pray
brothers
for
us
that
the
word
of the
Lord
may spread quickly
and
may be glorified
just as
also
with
you
and
that
we may be delivered
from
-
perverse
and
evil
men
not
for
all [are]
of the
faith
Faithful
however
is
the
Lord
who
will strengthen
you
and
will keep [you]
from
-
evil
We are persuaded
now
in
[the] Lord
as to
you
that
the things that
we command
both
you are doing
and
you will do
-
And
the Lord
may direct
your
-
hearts
into
the
love
-
of God
and
into
the
steadfastness
-
of Christ
We command
now
you
brothers
in
[the] name
of the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
are to withdraw
you
from
every
brother
idly
walking
and
not
according to
the
tradition
that
you received
from
us
Yourselves
for
you know
how
it behooves [you]
to imitate
us
because
not
we were idle
among
you
nor
without payment
bread
did we eat
from
anyone
but
in
labor
and
hardship
night
and
day
working
in order
-
not
to be burdensome to
any
of you
not
that
not
we have
[the] right
but
that
ourselves
[as] an example
we may offer
to you
for
-
you to imitate
us
Even
for
when
we were
with
you
this
we were commanding
you
that
if
anyone
not
is willing
to work
neither
let him eat
We hear
for
some
are walking
among
you
idly
not at all
working
but
being busybodies
To
now
such
we warn
and
exhort
by
our Lord
Jesus
Christ
so that
with
quietness
working
-
their own
bread
they may eat
You
now
brothers
not
shall grow weary
[in] well-doing
If
then
anyone
not
obey
this
instruction
of us
through
the
letter
of this [man]
take note
not
to mix with
him
so that
he may be ashamed
And yet
not
as
an enemy
esteem [him]
but
admonish [him]
as
a brother
Himself
now
the
Lord
-
of peace
may give
you
-
peace
through
all
in
every
way
The
Lord [be]
with
all
of you
The
greeting
-
in my own
hand
Paul
which
is
[my] sign
in
every
letter
In this manner
I write
The
grace
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
[be] with
all
of you
Paul
an apostle
of Christ
Jesus
according to
[the] command
of God
[the] Savior
of us
and
of Christ
Jesus
the
hope
of us
To Timothy
[my] true
child
in
[the] faith
Grace
mercy
[and] peace
from
God
[the] Father
and
Christ
Jesus
the
Lord
of us
Just as
I urged
you
to remain
in
Ephesus
[when] I was going
to
Macedonia
so that
you might warn
certain men
not
to teach other doctrines
nor
to give heed
to myths
and
genealogies
endless
which
speculations
bring
rather
than
stewardship
of God
which [is]
in
faith
-
And
the goal
of [our]
instruction
is
love
out of
a pure
heart
and
a conscience
good
and
a faith
sincere
from which
some
having missed the mark
have turned aside
to
meaningless discourse
desiring
to be
teachers of the Law
not
understanding
neither
what
they are saying
nor
[that] about
which
they confidently assert
We know
now
that
good [is]
the
law
if
one
it
lawfully
uses
knowing
this
that
for a righteous [one]
law
not
is enacted
for [the] lawless
however
and
insubordinate
for [the] ungodly
and
sinful
for [the] unholy
and
profane
for murderers of fathers
and
murderers of mothers
for slayers of man
for the sexually immoral
homosexuals
enslavers
liars
perjurers
and
if
anything
other
in the
being sound
teaching
is opposed to
according to
the
gospel
of the
glory
of the
blessed
God
with which
have been entrusted
I
Thankfulness
I have
for the [One]
having strengthened
me
Christ
Jesus
the
Lord
of us
that
faithful
me
He esteemed
having appointed [me]
to
service
-
formerly
being
a blasphemer
and
a persecutor
and
insolent
but
I was shown mercy
because
being ignorant
I did [it]
in
unbelief
Surpassingly increased
then
the
grace
of the
Lord
of us
with
[the] faith
and
love
that [are]
in
Christ
Jesus
Trustworthy [is]
the
saying
and
of full
acceptance
worthy
that
Christ
Jesus
came
into
the
world
sinners
to save
of whom
[the] foremost
am
I
But
because of
this
I was shown mercy
that
in
me
[the] foremost
might display
Jesus
Christ
-
perfect
patience
as
a pattern
for those
being about
to believe
on
Him
to
life
eternal
To
now
[the] King
of the
ages
[the] immortal
invisible
only
God
[be] honor
and
glory
to
the
ages
of the
ages
Amen
This
-
charge
I commit
to you
[my] child
Timothy
according to
the
going before
as to
you
prophecies
that
you might war
by
them
the
good
warfare
holding
faith
and
a good
conscience
which
some
having cast away
concerning
the
faith
have caused a shipwreck
among whom
are
Hymenaeus
and
Alexander
whom
I have handed over
-
to Satan
that
they may be disciplined
not
to blaspheme
I exhort
therefore
first
of all
to be made
entreaties
prayers
intercessions
[and] thanksgivings
on behalf of
all
men
for
kings
and
all
those
in
authority
being
so that
a tranquil
and
quiet
life
we may lead
in
all
godliness
and
dignity
This
[is] good
and
acceptable
before
the
Savior
of us
God
who
all
men
desires
to be saved
and
to
[the] knowledge
of [the] truth
to come
One
for
God [there is]
one
then
mediator
between God
and
men
[the] man
Christ
Jesus
the [One]
having given
Himself
[as] a ransom
for
all
the
testimony
in proper times
their own
in regard to
which
was appointed
I
a herald
and
an apostle
[the] truth
I am speaking
not
I do lie
a teacher
of [the] Gentiles
in
faith
and
truth
I desire
therefore
to pray
the
men
in
every
place
lifting up
holy
hands
apart from
anger
and
dissension
Likewise
women
in
apparel
respectable
with
modesty
and
self-control
should adorn
themselves
not
with
braided hair
or
gold
or
pearls
or
clothing
costly
but
with what
is becoming
to women
professing
[the] fear of God
through
works
good
A woman
in
quietness
let learn
in
all
submissiveness
To teach
however
a woman
not
I do permit
nor
to use authority over
a man
but
to be
in
quietness
Adam
for
first
was formed
then
Eve
And
Adam
not
was deceived
-
but
the woman
having been deceived
into
transgression
has come
She will be saved
however
through
-
childbearing
if
they abide
in
faith
and
love
and
holiness
with
self-restraint
Trustworthy [is]
the
saying
If
anyone
overseership
aspires to
of good
a work
he is desirous
It behooves
therefore
the
overseer
above reproach
to be
of one
wife
[the] husband
sober
self-controlled
respectable
hospitable
able to teach
not
given to wine
not
a striker
but
gentle
peaceable
not loving money
the
own
house
well
managing
children
having
in
submission
with
all
dignity
if
but
one
the
own
household
to manage
not
knows
how
[the] church
of God
[how] will he care for
not
a novice
that
not
having been puffed up
into
[the] judgment
he might fall
of the
devil
It behooves [him]
now
also
a testimony
good
to have
from
those
outside
so that
not
into
reproach
he might fall
and
[the] snare
of the
devil
Deacons
likewise
[must be] dignified
not
double-tongued
not
to wine
much
being given
not
greedy of dishonest gain
holding
to the
mystery
of the
faith
with
clear
a conscience
Also
these
now
let them be tested
first
then
let them serve
blameless
being
Women
likewise
[must be] dignified
not
slanderers
clear-minded
faithful
in
all things
Deacons
let be
of one
wife
husbands
[their] children
well
managing
and
the
own
households
Those
for
well
having served
a standing
for themselves
good
acquire
and
great
confidence
in
[the] faith
that [is]
in
Christ
Jesus
These things
to you
I am writing
hoping
to come
to
you
a short time
if
however
I should delay
so that
you may know
how
it behooves [one]
in
[the] household
of God
to conduct oneself
which
is
[the] church
of God
[the] living
[the] pillar
and
base
of the
truth
And
confessedly
great
is
the
-
of godliness
mystery
Who
was revealed
in
[the] flesh
was justified
in
[the] Spirit
was seen
by angels
was proclaimed
among
[the] nations
was believed on
in
[the] world
was taken up
in
glory
-
But
the Spirit
expressly
states
that
in
later
times
will depart from
some
the
faith
giving heed
to spirits
deceitful
and
teachings
of demons
in
hypocrisy
of speakers of lies
having been seared
in the
own
conscience
forbidding
to marry
[commanding] to abstain
from foods
that
-
God
created
for
reception
with
thanksgiving
by the
faithful
and
[those] knowing
the
truth
For
every
creature
of God
[is] good
and
nothing [is]
to be rejected
with
thanksgiving
being received
it is sanctified
for
by
[the] word
of God
and
prayer
These things
laying before
the
brothers
good
you will be
a servant
of Christ
Jesus
being nourished
in the
words
of the
faith
and
of the
good
teaching
that
you have closely followed
-
But
profane
and
silly
fables
refuse
Train
rather
yourself
to
godliness
-
For
bodily
exercise
of
a little
is
profit
-
but
godliness
for
everything
profitable
is
[the] promise
holding
of life
of the
present
and
of the [one]
coming
Trustworthy [is]
the
saying
and
of full
acceptance
worthy
For
this
for
we toil
and
strive
because
we have hope
on
God
[the] living
who
is
[the] Savior
of all
men
especially
of believers
Command
these things
and
teach
No one
your
-
youth
let despise
but
a pattern
be
for the
believers
in
speech
in
conduct
in
love
in
faith
in
purity
Until
I come
give heed
to the
public reading of Scripture
to
exhortation
to
teaching
Not
be negligent
of the
in
you
gift
which
was given
to you
through
prophecy
with
[the] laying on
of the
hands
of the
elderhood
These things
ponder
in
them
be absorbed
so that
your
-
progress
evident
may be
to all
Give heed
to yourself
and
to the
teaching
Continue
in them
this
for
doing
both
yourself
you will save
and
those
hearing
you
An elder
not
do rebuke
but
exhort [him]
as
a father
younger [men]
as
brothers
elder [women]
as
mothers
[and] younger [women]
as
sisters
in
all
purity
Widows
honor
who [are]
truly
widows
If
however
any
widow
children
or
grandchildren
has
let them learn
first
to the
own
household
to be devout
and
recompense
to give
to
parents
this
for
is
pleasing
before
-
God
She who [is]
now
indeed
a widow
and
being left alone
has hope
in
God
and
continues
-
in supplications
and
-
prayers
night
and
day
She
however
living in self-indulgence
[while] living
is dead
Also
these things
command
so that
above reproach
they should be
If
now
anyone
the
own
and
especially [his]
household
not
does provide for
the
faith
he has denied
and
he is
than an unbeliever
worse
A widow
let be enrolled
not
less than
years [old]
sixty
being
of one
man
[the] wife
in
works
good
being borne witness to
if
she has brought up children
if
she entertained strangers
if
saintsâ
feet
she has washed
if [to those]
being oppressed
she has imparted relief
if
every
work
good
she has followed after
Younger
however
widows
refuse
when
for
they might grow wanton against
-
Christ
to marry
they desire
incurring
judgment
because
the
first
faith
they have cast off
At the same time
then
also
[to be] idle
they learn
going about
-
house to house
not
only
then
idle
but
also
gossips
and
busybodies
speaking
things
not
being proper
I want
therefore
[the] younger [ones]
to marry
to bear children
to manage their households
no
occasion
to give
the [one]
opposing
of reproach
on account
Already
for
some
have turned aside
after
-
Satan
If
any
believing [woman]
has
[dependent] widows
let her impart relief
to them
and
not
let be burdened
the
church
so that
to those [who are]
truly
widows
it may impart relief
The
well
ruling
elders
of double
honor
let be counted worthy
especially
those
straining
in
[the] word
and
[the] teaching
Says
for
the
Scripture
An ox
treading out grain
not
you shall muzzle
and
Worthy [is]
the
workman
of the
wages
of him
Against
an elder
an accusation
not
do receive
except
if
not
upon
two
or
three
witnesses
Those
sinning
before
all
rebuke
so that
also
the
rest
fear
might have
I earnestly testify
before
-
God
and
Christ
Jesus
and
the
elect
angels
that
these things
you should keep
apart from
prejudice
nothing
doing
out of
partiality
Hands
hastily
on no one
lay
nor
share
in [the] sins
of others
yourself
pure
keep
No longer
drink [only] water
but
wine
a little
use
because of
the
stomach
and
the
frequent
of you
ailments
Of some
men
the
sins
manifest
are
going before [them]
to
judgment
of some
however
also
they appear later
Likewise
also
the
works
-
good
[are] evident
and even
those
otherwise
being
to be concealed
not
able
As many as
are
under
a yoke
[as] slaves
the
own
masters
of all
honor
worthy
let them esteem
so that
not
the
name
-
of God
and
the
teaching
should be blasphemed
Those
now
believing
having
masters
not
let them despise [them]
because
brothers
they are
but
rather
let them serve [them]
because
believing [ones]
they are
and
beloved
-
by the
good service
being helped
These things
teach
and
exhort
If
anyone
teaches another doctrine
and
not
draws near
[the] being sound
words
-
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
and
the
according to
godliness
teaching
he is puffed up
nothing
knowing
but
unhealthy
about
controversies
and
disputes about words
out of
which
come
envy
strife
slander
suspicions
evil
[and] constant frictions
corrupted
among men
-
in mind
and
destitute
of the
truth
holding
a means of gain
to be
-
godliness
Is
however
gain
great
-
godliness
with
contentment
Nothing
for
we brought
into
the
world
because
neither
to carry out
anything
are we able
Having
however
sustenance
and
coverings
with these
we will be content
Those
however
desiring
to be rich
fall
into
temptation
and
a snare
and
desires
many
foolish
and
harmful
which
plunge
-
men
into
ruin
and
destruction
A root
for
of all kinds
-
of evils
is
the
love of money
which
some
stretching after
have been seduced
away from
the
faith
and
themselves
have pierced
with sorrows
many
You
however
O
man
of God
these things
flee
pursue
now
righteousness
godliness
faith
love
endurance
[and] gentleness
Fight
the
good
fight
of the
faith
Lay hold
of the
eternal
life
to
which
you were called
and also
did confess
the
good
confession
before
many
witnesses
I charge
before
-
God
the [One]
giving life
to
all things
and
Christ
Jesus
the [One]
having testified
before
Pontius
Pilate
the
good
confession
to keep
you
the
commandment
without stain
above reproach
until
the
appearing
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
which
seasons
in the own
He will display
the
blessed
and
alone
Sovereign
the
King
of those
being kings
and
[the] Lord
of those
being lords
-
alone
having
immortality
in light
dwelling
unapproachable
whom
has seen
no one
of men
nor
to see
is able
to whom [be]
honor
and
dominion
eternal
Amen
To the
rich
in
the
present
age
instruct [them]
not
to be high-minded
nor
to have hope
in
of riches
[the] uncertainty
but
on
God
the [One]
providing
us
all things
richly
for
enjoyment
to do good
to be rich
in
works
good
generous in distributing
to be
ready to share
treasuring up
for themselves
a foundation
good
for
the
future
so that
they may take hold
of
that which is indeed
life
O
Timothy
the
deposit committed [to you]
guard
avoiding
-
profane
empty babblings
and
opposing arguments
-
falsely called
knowledge
which
some
professing
from
the
faith
have gone astray
-
Grace [be]
with
you all
Paul
an apostle
of Christ
Jesus
by
[the] will
of God
according to
[the] promise
of life
-
in
Christ
Jesus
To Timothy
[my] beloved
child
Grace
mercy
[and] peace
from
God
[the] Father
and
Christ
Jesus
the
Lord
of us
Thankful
I am
-
to God
whom
I serve
from
[my] forefathers
with
a pure
conscience
as
unceasingly
I have
the
of
you
remembrance
in
the
prayers
of me
night
and
day
longing
you
to see
recalling
your
-
tears
so that
with joy
I may be filled
remembrance
having taken
of the
within
you
sincere
faith
which
dwelt
first
in
the
grandmother
of you
Lois
and
in the
mother
of you
Eunice
I am persuaded
now
that
also
[it is] in
you
For
this
reason
I remind
you
to kindle anew
the
gift
-
of God
which
is
in
you
by
the
laying on
of the
hands
of me
Not
for
has given
us
-
God
a spirit
of cowardice
but
of power
and
of love
and
of self-control
Not
therefore
you should be ashamed of
the
testimony
of the
Lord
of us
nor
of me
the
prisoner
of Him
but
suffer together
for the
gospel
according to
[the] power
of God
the [One]
having saved
us
and
having called [us]
with a calling
holy
not
according to
the
works
of us
but
according to
His own
purpose
and
grace

having been given

in
Christ
Jesus
before
time
eternal
having been made manifest
also
now
by
the
appearing
of the
Savior
of us
Christ
Jesus
having abolished
indeed
-
death
having brought to light
now
life
and
immortality
through
the
gospel
to
which
was appointed
I
a herald
and
an apostle
and
a teacher
For
this
reason
also
these things
I suffer
But
not
I am ashamed
I know
for
whom
I have believed
and
I am persuaded
that
able
He is
the
deposit entrusted
of me
to guard
for
that

day
[The] pattern
retain
of sound
words
which
from
me
you did hear
in
[the] faith
and
love
that [are]
in
Christ
Jesus
The
good
deposit entrusted [to you]
keep
by
[the] Spirit
Holy
the [One]
dwelling
in
us
You know
this
that
turned away from
me
all
those
in
-
Asia
among whom
are
Phygelus
and
Hermogenes
May grant
mercy
the
Lord
to the
of Onesiphorus
household
because
often
me
he refreshed
and
the
chain
of me
not
he was ashamed of
But
having arrived
in
Rome
earnestly
he sought out
me
and
found [me]
May grant
unto him
the
Lord
to find
mercy
from
[the] Lord
in
that
-
day
And
how much
in
Ephesus
he served
very well
you
know
You
therefore
child
of me
be strong
in
the
grace
that [is]
in
Christ
Jesus
And
the things which
you have heard
from
me
among
many
witnesses
these
entrust
to faithful
men
such as
sufficient
will be
also
others
to teach
Share in suffering
as
[a] good
soldier
of Christ
Jesus
No one
serving as a soldier
entangles himself
in the
of this
life
affairs
that
the [one]
having enlisted him
he might please
If
now
also
competes
anyone
not
he is crowned
if
not
lawfully
he shall have competed
For the
hardworking
farmer
it is necessary
first
of the
fruits
to partake
Consider
the things
I am saying
will give
for
you
the
Lord
understanding
in
all things
Remember
Jesus
Christ
having been raised
out from
[the] dead
of [the]
seed
of David
according to
-
gospel
my
in
which
I suffer hardship
even to
chains
as
an evildoer
But
the
word
-
of God
not
is bound
Because of
this
all things
I endure
for the sake of
the
elect
so that
also
they
[the] salvation
may obtain
that [is]
in
Christ
Jesus
with
glory
eternal
Trustworthy [is]
the
saying
If
for
we have died together [with Him]
also
we will live together [with Him]
if
we endure
also
we will reign together [with Him]
if
we will deny [Him]
He also
will deny
us
if
we are faithless
He
faithful
remains
to deny
for
Himself
not
He is able
These things
remind [them]
solemnly charging [them]
before
-
God
not
to quarrel about words
for
nothing
profitable
[but] to
[the] subversion
of those
hearing
Hasten
yourself
approved
to present
-
to God
a workman
not ashamed
accurately handling
the
word
-
of truth
-
But
worldly
empty babblings
avoid
on
to more
for
they will lead
ungodliness
and
the
talk
of them
like
gangrene
pasture to grow
will have
among whom
are
Hymenaeus
and
Philetus
who
concerning
the
truth
have gone astray
asserting
resurrection
already
to have taken place
and
they are overthrowing
the
of some
faith
-
Nevertheless
the firm
foundation
of
God
stands
having
the
seal
this
Knows
[the] Lord
those
being
His
and
Let depart
from
iniquity
everyone
-
naming
the
name
of the Lord
In
a great
now
house
not
there are
only
vessels
golden
and
silver
but
also
wooden
and
earthen
and
some
indeed
unto
honor
some
however
unto
dishonor
If
therefore
anyone
shall have cleansed
himself
from
these
he will be
a vessel
for
honor
having been sanctified
useful
to the
Master
for
every
work
good
having been prepared
-
And
youthful
lusts
flee
pursue
now
righteousness
faith
love
[and] peace
along with
those
calling on
the
Lord
out of
pure
a heart
-
And
foolish
and
ignorant
speculations
refuse
knowing
that
they breed
quarrels
[The] bond-servant
now
of [the] Lord
not
it behooves
to quarrel
but
gentle
to be
toward
all
able to teach
forbearing
in
gentleness
disciplining
those
opposing
lest
ever
may give
them
-
God
repentance
unto
a knowledge
of [the] truth
and
they might come to their senses
out of
the
of the
devil
snare
having been captured
by
him
for
-
his
will
This
however
realize
that
in
[the] last
days
will be present
times
difficult
Will be
for
-
men
lovers of self
lovers of money
boastful
proud
abusive
to parents
disobedient
ungrateful
unholy
unloving
implacable
slanderous
without self-control
savage
without love of good
treacherous
reckless
puffed up
lovers of pleasure
rather
than
lovers of God
having
a form
of godliness
-
but
the power
of it
denying
And
these
turn away from
Out of
this sort
for
are
those
entering
into
-
households
and
taking captive
weak women
burdened
with sins
being led away
by passions
various
always
learning
and
never
to
a knowledge
of [the] truth
to come
being able
By which
way
now
Jannes
and
Jambres
opposed
Moses
so
also
these
oppose
the
truth
men
being depraved
-
in mind
disqualified
regarding
the
faith
But
not
they will advance
further
much
-
for
the folly
of them
plain
will be
to all
as
also
that
of those [two]
became
You
however
have closely followed
my
-
teaching
-
conduct
-
purpose
-
faith
-
patience
-
love
-
endurance
-
persecutions
-
sufferings
such as
to me
happened
in
Antioch
in
Iconium
in
Lystra
what manner of
persecutions
I endured
And yet
out of
all
me
delivered
the
Lord
Also
all
now
-
desiring
to live
piously
in
Christ
Jesus
will be persecuted
Evil
however
men
and
impostors
will advance
to
-
worse
deceiving
and
being deceived
You
however
abide
in
the things
you have learned
and
have been assured of
having known
from
whom
you learned [them]
and
that
from
childhood
sacred
writings
you have known
-
being able
you
to make wise
unto
salvation
through
faith
-
in
Christ
Jesus
Every
Scripture [is]
God-breathed
and
profitable
for
instruction
for
conviction
for
correction
[and] for
training
-
in
righteousness
so that
complete
may be
the
-
of God
man
toward
every
work
good
having been fully equipped
I earnestly declare
before
-
God
and
Christ
Jesus
the [One]
being about
to judge
[the] living
and
[the] dead
and
by the
appearing
of Him
and
the
kingdom
of Him
Preach
the
word
be ready
in season
[and] out of season
convict
rebuke
[and] exhort
with
complete
patience
and
instruction
There will be
for
a time
when
-
sound
teaching
not
they will endure
but
according to
the
own
desires
to themselves
they will gather around [them]
teachers
having an itching
-
ear
and
from
indeed
the
truth
-
hearing
they will turn away
unto
then
-
myths
they will be turned aside
You
however
be sober
in
all things
endure afflictions
[the] work
do
of an evangelist
the
ministry
of you
fully carry out
I
for
already
am being poured out
and
the
time
of the
departure
of me
is come
The
good
fight
I have fought
the
race
I have finished
the
faith
I have kept
From now on
is laid up
for me
the
-
of righteousness
crown
which
will award
to me
the
Lord
in
that
-
day
the
righteous
judge
not
only
however
to me
but
also
to all
those
loving
the
appearing
of Him
Be diligent
to come
to
me
quickly

Will render

Lord
according to
the

also
you
beware of
exceedingly
for
he has opposed

our
message
In
-
first
of me
defense
no one
me
has stood with
but
all
me
deserted
Not
to them
may it be charged
-
And
the Lord
me
stood by
and
strengthened
me
so that
through
me
the
proclamation
would be fully accomplished
and
should hear
all
the
Gentiles
And
I was delivered
out of
[the] mouth
of the lion
Will deliver
me
the

from

of Jesus
Christ
according to
[the] faith
of [the] elect
of God
and
knowledge
of [the] truth
which [is]
according to

from

[the] Father
and

Jesus
the
Savior
of us
Of this
on account
I left
you
in
Crete
so that
the things
lacking
you might set in order
and
might appoint
in every
town
elders
as
I
you
directed
if
anyone
is
blameless
of one
wife
[the] husband
children
having
believing
not
under
accusation
of debauchery
or
insubordinate
It behooves
for
the
overseer
blameless
to be
as
Godâs
steward
not
self-willed
not
quick tempered
not
given to wine
not
a striker
not
greedy of base gain
but
hospitable
a lover of good
self-controlled
upright
holy
[and] disciplined
holding to
the
according to
the
teaching
faithful
word
that
able
he may be
both
to encourage
with
-
teaching
-
sound
and
those
contradicting [it]
to convict
There are
for
many
insubordinate
empty talkers
and
deceivers
especially
those
of
the
circumcision
whom
it is necessary
to silence
who
whole
households
overthrow
teaching
things that [they]
not
ought
base
gain
for [the] sake of
Said
one
of
them
own
of them
a prophet
Cretans
[are] always
liars
evil
beasts
gluttons
lazy
The
testimony
this
is
true
for
which
cause
rebuke
them
severely
so that
they may be sound
in
the
faith
not
giving heed
to Jewish
myths
and
[the] commandments
of men
turning away from
the
truth
All things [are]
pure
to the
pure
to those
however
being defiled
and
unbelieving
nothing
[is] pure
Instead
are defiled
their
both
-
mind
and
-
conscience
God
they profess
to know
in
however
works
they deny [Him]
detestable
being
and
disobedient
and
for
any
work
good
unfit
You
however
speak
the things that
are consistent with
-
sound
doctrine
[The] aged [men]
sober-minded
are to be
dignified
self-controlled
sound
-
in faith
-
in love
-
in endurance
[the] aged [women]
likewise
in
behavior
reverent
not
slanderers
not
to wine
much
being enslaved
teachers of what is good
so that
they may train
the
young [women]
lovers of [their] husbands
to be
loving [their] children
self-controlled
pure
keepers at home
kind
being subject
to the
own
husbands
so that
not
the
word
-
of God
should be maligned
The
younger [men]
likewise
exhort
to be self-controlled
In
all things
yourself
be holding forth
[as] a pattern
of good
works
in
the
teaching
integrity
dignity
speech
sound
beyond reproach
so that
he who is
of the
contrary
may be ashamed
nothing
having
to say
concerning
us
evil
Servants
to their own
masters
are to be subject
in
everything
well-pleasing
to be
not
gainsaying
not
pilfering
but
all
fidelity
showing
good
so that
the
doctrine
of
the
Savior
of us
God
they may adorn
in
all things
Has appeared
for
the
grace
-
of God
bringing salvation
to all
men
instructing
us
that
having denied
-
ungodliness
and
-
worldly
passions
discreetly
and
righteously
and
piously
we should live
in
the
present
age
awaiting
the
blessed
hope
and
[the] appearing
of the
glory
of the
great
God
and
Savior
of us
Christ
Jesus
who
gave
Himself
for
us
that
He might redeem
us
from
all
lawlessness
and
might purify
to Himself
a people
specially chosen
zealous
of good
works
These things
speak
and
exhort
and
rebuke
with
all
authority
No one
you
let despise
Remind
them
to rulers
to authorities
to be subject
to be obedient
for
every
work
good
ready
to be
no one
to speak evil of
peaceable
to be
gentle
all
showing
humility
toward
all
men
Were
for
once
also
we ourselves
foolish
disobedient
being deceived
serving
lusts
and
pleasures
various
in
malice
and
envy
living
hateful
hating
one another
When
however
the
kindness
and
the
love of mankind
appeared
of the
Savior
of us
God
not
by
works
-
in
righteousness
that
did
we
but
according to
-
His
mercy
He saved
us
through
[the] washing
of regeneration
and
renewing
of [the] Spirit
Holy
whom
He poured out
on
us
richly
through
Jesus
Christ
the
Savior
of us
so that
having been justified
-
by that
grace
heirs
we should become
according to
[the] hope
of life
eternal
Trustworthy [is]
the
saying
and
concerning
these things
I want
you
to affirm strongly
so that
may take care
good
works
to be devoted to
those
believing
God
These things
are
excellent
and
profitable
-
to men
Foolish
however
controversies
and
genealogies
and
arguments
and
quarrels
about [the] Law
avoid
they are
for
unprofitable
and
worthless
A factious
man
after
one
and
a second
admonition
reject
knowing
that
is corrupt
-
such a man
and
is sinning
being
self-condemned

I shall send

hearing
of your
-
love
and
the
faith
that
you have
toward
the
Lord
Jesus
and
toward
all
the
saints
so that
the
fellowship
of the
faith
of you
effective
might become
in
[the] acknowledgment
of every
good [thing]
that [is]
in
us
in
Christ
Joy
for
great
I have
and
encouragement
by occasion of
the
love
of you
because
the
hearts
of the
saints
have been refreshed
by
you
brother
Therefore
much
in
Christ
boldness
having
to order
you
what [is]
befitting
for the sake of
-
love
rather
I exhort [you]
such a one
being
as
Paul
aged
now
then
also
a prisoner
of Christ
Jesus
I exhort
you
for
-
my
child
whom
I have begotten
in
-
chains
Onesimus
-
once
to you
useless
now
however
both
to you
and
to me
useful
whom
I have sent back
to you
in person
he who
is
-
my
very heart
whom
I
was wishing
with
myself
to keep
so that
on behalf of
you
me
he might serve
in
the
chains
of the
gospel
Apart from
however
-
your
consent
nothing
I wished
to do
so that
not
as
according to
necessity
the
good
of you
may be
but
according to
willingness
Perhaps
for
because of
this
he was separated [from you]
for
a time
so that
eternally
him
you might possess
no longer
as
a slave
but
above
a slave
a brother
beloved
especially
to me
how much
however
more
to you
both
in
[the] flesh
and
in
[the] Lord
If
therefore
me
you consider
a partner
receive
him
as
me
If
however
in any way
he has wronged
you
or
he owes [you]
this
to me
charge
I
Paul
did write
with
my own
hand
I
will repay [it]
that
not
I may say
to you
that
even
yourself
to me
you owe also
Yes
brother
I
from you
may have profit
in
[the] Lord
Refresh
my
-
heart
in
Christ
Being persuaded of
the
obedience
of you
I write
to you
knowing
that
even
above
what
I say
you will do
At the same time
now
also
prepare
for me
a lodging
I hope
for
that
through
the
prayers
of you
I will be granted
to you
Greets

-
fellow prisoner
my
in
Christ
Jesus
[as do] Mark
Aristarchus
Demas
[and] Luke
the
fellow workers
of me
The
grace
of the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
[be] with
the
spirit
of you
In many portions
and
in many ways
long ago
-
God
having spoken
to the
fathers
in
the
prophets
in
last
-
days
these
has spoken
to us
in
[His] Son
whom
He appointed
heir
of all things
through
whom
also
He made
the
ages
who
being
[the] radiance
of [His]
glory
and
[the] exact expression
of the
substance
of Him
upholding
then
-
all things
by the
word
of the
power
of Himself
[the] purification
-
of sins
having made
sat down
at
[the] right hand
of the
Majesty
on
high
By so much
superior
having become
to the
angels
as much as
more excellent
beyond
theirs
He has inherited
a name
To which
for
did He say
ever
of the
angels
Son
of me
are
You
I
today
have begotten
You
And
again
I
will be
to Him
for
a Father
and
He
will be
to Me
for
a Son
When
then
again
He brings
the
Firstborn
into
the
world
He says
And
let worship
Him
all
[the] angels
of God
And
as to
indeed
the
angels
He says
The [One]
making
the
angels
of Him
winds
and
the
ministers
of Him
of fire
a flame
Unto
however
the
Son
The
throne
of You
O
God
[is] to
the
age
of the
age
and
the
scepter
of
righteousness [is]
[the] scepter
of the
kingdom
of You
You have loved
righteousness
and
have hated
wickedness
because of
this
has anointed
You
-
God
the
God
of You
with [the] oil
of exultation
above
the
companions
of You
And
You
in
[the] beginning
Lord
of the
earth
laid the foundation
and
works
of the
hands
of You
are
the
heavens
They
will perish
You
however
remain
and
all
like
a garment
will grow old
and
like
a robe
You will roll up
them
like
a garment
also
they will be changed
You
however
the
same
are
and
the
years
of You
not
will never end
To
which
now
of the
angels
did He say
ever
Sit
at
[the] right hand
of Me
until
-
I may place
the
enemies
of You
[as] a footstool
for the
feet
of You
Not
all
are they
ministering
spirits
for
service
being sent forth
for the sake of
those
being about
to inherit
salvation
Because of
this
it behooves
more abundantly
to give heed
us
to the things
we have heard
lest
ever
we should drift away
If
for
the
by
angels
having been spoken
word
was
unalterable
and
every
transgression
and
disobedience
received
a just
recompense
how
we
will escape
such a great
having neglected
a salvation
which
a commencement
having received
declared
by
the
Lord
by
those
having heard
to
us
it was confirmed
bearing witness
-
God
by signs
together with [them]
and
wonders
and
by various
miracles
and
of [the] Spirit
Holy
distributions
according to
the
of Him
will
Not
for
to angels
did He subject
the
world
that
is coming
of
which
we are speaking
Has testified
however
somewhere
someone
saying
What
is
man
that
You are mindful
of him
or
[the] son
of man
that
You care for
him
You made lower
him
a little
some
than
[the] angels
with glory
and
honor
You crowned
him
all things
You have put in subjection
under
the
feet
of him
In
-
for
subjecting
to him
-
all things
nothing
He left
to him
unsubject
At present
however
not yet
do we see
to Him
-
all things
having been subjected
Who
however
a little
one
than
[the] angels
having been made lower
we see
Jesus
because of
the
suffering
-
of death
with glory
and
with honor
having been crowned
so that
by [the] grace
of God
for
everyone
He might taste
death
It was fitting
for
to Him
for
whom [are]
-
all things
and
by
whom [are]
-
all things
many
sons
to
glory
having brought
the
archetype
of the
salvation
of them
through
sufferings
to make perfect
The [One]
both
for
sanctifying
and
those
being sanctified
of
one
[are] all
for
which
reason
not
He is ashamed
brothers
them
to call
saying
I will declare
the
name
of You
to the
brothers
of Me
in
[the] midst
of [the] congregation
I will sing praises
of you
And
again
I
will be
trusting
in
Him
And
again
Behold
I
and
the
children
whom
to Me
has given
-
God
Since
therefore
the
children
have partaken
of blood
and
of flesh
also
He
likewise
took part in
the
same things
so that
through
[His]
death
He might destroy
the [one]
the
power
holding
-
of death
that
is
the
devil
and
might set free
those
who
fear
of death
through
all
[their time]
to live
subject
were
to slavery
Not
for
surely
[the] angels
He helps
but
[the] seed
of Abraham
He helps
Therefore
it behooved [Him]
in
all things
[His]
brothers
to be made like
so that
a merciful
He might become
and
faithful
high priest
[in] things
relating to
-
God
in order
-
to make propitiation for
the
sins
of the
people
In
that
for
has suffered
He Himself
having been tempted
He is able
those
being tempted
to help
Therefore
brothers
holy
of [the] calling
heavenly
partakers
carefully consider
the
apostle
and
high priest
of the
confession
of us
Jesus
faithful
being
to the [One]
having appointed
Him
as
also
Moses
in
all
the
house
of Him
Of greater
for
He
glory
than
Moses
has been counted worthy
by
so much as
greater
honor
has
than the
house [itself]
the [one]
having built
it
Every
for
house
is built
by
someone
the [One]
however
everything
having built [is]
God
And
Moses
indeed
[was] faithful
in
all
the
house
of Him
as
a servant
unto
a testimony
of the things
going to be spoken
Christ
however
as
[the] Son
over
the
house
of Him
whose
house
are
we
if indeed
[our]
confidence
and
the
boast
of [our]
hope
unto
[the] end
firm
we should hold
Therefore
just as
says
the
Spirit
-
Holy
Today
if
the
voice
of Him
you should hear
not
harden
the
hearts
of you
as
in
the
rebellion
in
the
day
-
of testing
in
the
wilderness
where
tried [Me]
the
fathers
of you
by
testing
and
saw
the
works
of Me
forty
years
Therefore
I was angry
with the
generation
that
and
I said
Always
they go astray
-
in the heart
of them
and
not
have they known
the
ways
of Me
so
I swore
in
the
wrath
of Me
[not]
shall they enter
into
the
rest
of Me
Take heed
brothers
lest
ever
there will be
in
any
of you
a heart
evil
of unbelief
into
-
falling away
from
God
[the] living
But
encourage
other
each
every
day
while
-
-
today
it is called
so that
not
may be hardened
one
of
you
by [the] deceitfulness
-
of sin
Partakers
for
-
of Christ
we have become
if indeed
from the
beginning
the
assurance
unto
[the] end
firm
we should hold
As
-
it is said
Today
if
the
voice
of Him
you should hear
not
harden
the
hearts
of you
as
in
the
rebellion
Who
for
[were those] having heard
rebelled
but
not
all
those
having come
out of
Egypt
by the leading of
Moses
With whom
now
was He indignant
forty
years
[if] not
with those
having sinned
whose
-
bodies
fell
in
the
wilderness
To whom
then
did He swear that
not
shall they enter
into
the
rest
of Him
if
not
to those
having disobeyed
And
we see
that
not
they were able
to enter in
because of
unbelief
We should fear
therefore
lest
ever
left remaining
of the promise
to enter
into
the
rest
of Him
should seem
any
of
you
to have fallen short
And
for
we are [those]
having had the gospel preached
just as
they [did]
but
not
did profit
the
message
of [their]
hearing
them
not
having been united with
the
faith
of those
having heard
We enter
for
into
the
rest
those
having believed
as
He has said
So
I swore
in
the
wrath
of me
Not
shall they enter
into
the
rest
of Me
And yet
the
works
from
[the] foundation
of [the] world
have been finished
He has spoken
for
somewhere
concerning
the
seventh [day]
in this way
And
rested
-
God
on
the
day
-
seventh
from
all
the
works
of Him
And
in
this [passage]
again
[Not]
shall they enter
into
the
rest
of Me
Since
therefore
it remains [for]
some
to enter
into
it
and
those
formerly
having received the good news
not
did enter in
because of
disobedience
again
a certain
He appoints
day
Today
through
David
saying
after
so long
a time
just as
it has been said
Today
if
the
voice
of Him
you shall hear
not
harden
the
hearts
of you
If
for
to them
Joshua
had given rest
not
-
about
another
He would have spoken
after
this
day
So then
there remains
a Sabbath rest
for the
people
-
of God
The [one]
for
having entered
into
the
rest
of Him
also
he
rested
from
the
works
of him
as
from
the
own
-
God [did]
We should be diligent
therefore
to enter
into
that
-
rest
so that
not
by
the
same
anyone
example
should fall
-
of disobedience
Living [is]
for
the
word
-
of God
and
active
and
sharper
than
any
sword
two-edged
even
penetrating
as far as
[the] division
of soul
and
spirit
of joints
and
also
marrows
and
able to judge
[the] thoughts
and
intentions
of [the] heart
And
not
there is
creature
hidden
before
Him
all things
however
[are] uncovered
and
laid bare
to the
eyes
of Him
to
whom
[is] our
-
reckoning
Having
therefore
a high priest
great
having passed through
the
heavens
Jesus
the
Son
-
of God
we should hold firmly
to [our]
confession
Not
for
have we
a high priest
not
being able
to sympathize
with the
weaknesses
of us
[one] having been tempted
however
in
all things
by
the same way
without
sin
We should come
therefore
with
boldness
to the
throne
-
of grace
so that
we may receive
mercy
and
grace
may find
for
in time of need
help
Every
for
high priest
from among
men
being taken
on behalf of
men
is appointed
in things
relating to
-
God
that
he should offer
gifts
both
and
sacrifices
for
sins
to exercise forbearance
being able
with those
being ignorant
and
going astray
since
also
he himself
is encompassed by
weakness
and
because of
this
he is obligated
just as
for
the
people
so
also
for
himself
to offer sacrifices
for
sins
And
not
upon himself
anyone
takes
the
honor
but rather
being called
by
-
God
just as
also
Aaron
So
also
-
Christ
not
Himself
did glorify
to become
a high priest
but
the [One]
having said
to
Him
Son
of Me
are
You
I
today
have begotten
You
Just as
also
in
another [place]
He says
You [are]
a priest
to
the
age
according to
the
order
of Melchizedek
[He]
in
the
days
of the
flesh
of Him
prayers
both
and
supplications
to
the [One]
being able
to save
Him
from
death
with
crying
loud
and
tears
having offered up
and
having been heard
because of
-
reverence
though
being
a Son
He learned
from
the things
He suffered
-
obedience
and
having been perfected
He became
to all
those
obeying
Him
[the] author
of salvation
eternal
having been designated
by
-
God
a high priest
according to
the
order
of Melchizedek
Concerning
this
[there is] much
from us
-
speech
and
difficult in interpretation
to speak
since
sluggish
you have become
in the
hearings
Even
for
you ought
to be
teachers
by
the
time
again
need of
you have
[one]
to teach
you
what [is]
the
principles
of the
beginning
of the
oracles
-
of God
and
you have become
need
[those] having
of milk
not
of solid
food
Everyone
for
-
partaking [only]
of milk
[is] inexperienced
in [the] word
of righteousness
an infant
for
he is
[for the] mature
however
is
-
solid
food
the [ones]
by
-
constant use
the
senses
training
having
for
distinguishing
good
both
and
evil
Therefore
having left
the
-
beginning
of the
Christ
teaching
to
-
maturity
we should go on
not
again
a foundation
laying
of repentance
from
dead
works
and
faith
in
God
about baptisms
instruction
of laying on
then
of hands
of [the] resurrection
of [the] dead
and
of judgment
eternal
And
this
we will do
if
permits
-
God
[It is] impossible
for
to those
once
having been enlightened
having tasted
then
of the
gift
-
heavenly
and
partakers
having become
of [the] Spirit
Holy
and
[the] goodness
having tasted
of Godâs
word
[the] power
also
[of the] coming
age
and then
having fallen away
again
to restore [them]
to
repentance
crucifying
in themselves
the
Son
-
of God
and
subjecting [Him] to open shame
Land
for
-
having drunk in
the
upon
it
coming
often
rain
and
producing
vegetation
useful
for those
for the sake of
whom
also
it is tilled
partakes
of blessing
from
-
God
[That] bringing forth
however
thorns
and
thistles
[is] worthless
and
a curse
near to
of which
the
end [is]
unto
burning
We are persuaded
however
concerning
you
beloved
of
better [things]
and
[things] accompanying
salvation
if
even
like this
we speak
Not
for
unjust [is]
-
God
to forget
the
work
of you
and
the
love
that
you have shown
toward
the
name
of Him
having ministered
to the
saints
and
[still] ministering
We desire
now
each
of you
the
same
to show
earnestness
toward
the
full assurance
of the
hope
unto
[the] end
so that
not
sluggish
you may be
imitators
however
of those
through
faith
and
patience
inheriting
the
promises
-
For
to Abraham
having made His promise
-
God
since
by
no one
He had
greater
to swear
He swore
by
Himself
saying
If
surely
blessing
I will bless
you
and
multiplying
I will multiply
you
And
thus
having waited patiently
he obtained
the
promise
Men
for
by
[one]
greater
swear
and
of all
their
disputes
an end
for
confirmation
[is] the
oath
in
which
more abundantly
desiring
-
God
to show
to the
heirs
of the
promise
the
unchangeableness
of the
purpose
of Him
guaranteed [it]
by an oath
so that
by
two
things
unchangeable
in
which
[it is] impossible
to lie
[for] God
strong
encouragement
we may have
-
having fled for refuge
to take hold
of the
being set before [us]
hope
which
as
an anchor
we have
of the
soul
sure
both
and
unshakable
and
entering
into
that
within
the
veil
where
[the] forerunner
for
us
has entered
Jesus
according to
the
order
of Melchizedek
a high priest
having become
to
the
age
This
for
-
Melchizedek
King
of Salem
priest
-
of God
-
Most High
-
having met
Abraham
returning
from
the
slaughter
of the
kings
and
having blessed
him
[is he] to whom
also
a tenth
of
all
apportioned
Abraham
first
indeed
being translated
king
of righteousness
then
and
also
king
of Salem
which
is
king
of peace
Without father
without mother
without genealogy
neither
beginning
of days
nor
of life
end
having
having been made like
however
the
Son
-
of God
he remains
a priest
unto
-
all time
Consider
now
how great
this one [was]
to whom
a tenth
Abraham
gave
out of
the
best spoils
the
patriarch
And
those
indeed
out from
the
sons
of Levi
the
priestly office
receiving
a commandment
have
to take a tenth
from the
people
according to
the
law
that
is
from the
brothers
of them
though
having come
out of
the
loin
of Abraham
The [one]
however
not
tracing his ancestry
from
them
has collected a tenth
from Abraham
and
the [one]
having
the
promises
has blessed
Apart from
now
all
dispute
the
inferior
by
the
superior
is blessed
And
here
indeed
tithes
dying
men
receive
in that place
however
it is testified
that
he lives on
And
so
a word
to speak
through
Abraham
also
Levi
the [one]
tithes
receiving
paid the tithe
Still
for
in
the
loin
of [his]
father
he was
when
met
him
Melchizedek
If
indeed
then
perfection
by
the
Levitical
priesthood
were
the
people
for
upon
it
had received [the] Law
what
still
need [was there]
according to
the
order
of Melchizedek
[for] another
to arise
priest
and
not
according to
the
order
of Aaron
to be named
Being changed
for
of the
priesthood
from
necessity
also
of law
a change
takes place
[He] concerning
whom
for
are said
these things
a tribe
another
belonged to
from
which
no one
has served
at the
altar
[It is] evident
for
that
out of
Judah
has sprung
the
Lord
of us
as to
which
a tribe
concerning
priests
nothing
Moses
spoke
And
more abundantly
yet
evident
it is
if
according to
the
likeness
of Melchizedek
arises
a priest
another
who
not
according to
a law
of a commandment
fleshly
has been constituted
but
according to
[the] power
of a life
indestructible
It is testified
for
-
You [are]
a priest
to
the
age
according to
the
order
of Melchizedek
A putting away
indeed
for
there is
of the preceding
commandment
because of
-
its
weakness
and
uselessness
nothing
for
perfected
the
law
[the] introduction
then
of a better
hope
by
which
we draw near
-
to God
And
to
as much as
not
apart from
an oath
those ones
truly
for
without
an oath
are
priests
becoming
[He]
however
with
an oath
through
the [One]
saying
to
Him
Has sworn
[the] Lord
and
not
will change His mind
You [are]
a priest
to
the
age
By
so much
also
of a better
covenant
has become
[the] guarantee
Jesus
And
those
indeed
many
are
having become
priests
because of
-
by death
being prevented from
continuing
-
But
because of
the
abiding
of Him
to
the
age
a permanent
He holds
-
priesthood
wherefore
also
to save
to
the
uttermost
He is able
those
drawing near
through
Him
-
to God
always
living
for
-
to intercede
for
them
Such
indeed
for us
also
was fitting
a high priest
holy
innocent
undefiled
having been separated
from
-
sinners
and
higher
than the
heavens
having become
who
not
has
every
day
need
as
the
high priests
first
for
the
own
sins
sacrifices
to offer up
then
for those
of the
people
this
for
He did
once for all
Himself
having offered up
The
law
for
men
appoints
as high priests
having
weakness
the
word
however
of the
oath
which [is]
after
the
law
a Son
to
the
age
having been perfected
[The] sum
now
of
the things
being spoken of [is that]
such
we have
a high priest
who
sat down
at
[the] right hand
of the
throne
of the
Majesty
in
the
heavens
in the
holy places
a minister
and
in the
tabernacle
-
true
which
has pitched
the
Lord
not
man
Every
for
high priest
in order
-
to offer
gifts
both
and
sacrifices
is appointed
wherefore [it was]
necessary
to have
something
also
[for] this One
that
He might offer
If
certainly
then
He were
on
earth
not even
-
would He be
a priest
there being
those
offering
according to
law
the
gifts
who
a copy
and
shadow
serve
of the
heavenly
as
was divinely instructed
Moses
being about
to complete
the
tabernacle
See that
for
He says
you shall make
all things
according to
the
pattern
-
having been shown
you
in
the
mountain
Now
however
more excellent
He has obtained
a ministry
as much as
also
of a better
He is
covenant
[the] mediator
which
upon
better
promises
has been enacted
If
for
the
first
that
had been
faultless
not
-
for a second
would have been sought
a place
Finding fault
for
with them
He says
Behold
[the] days
are coming
says
[the] Lord
and
I will ratify
with
the
house
of Israel
and
with
the
house
of Judah
a covenant
new
not
according to
the
covenant
that
I made
with
fathers
of them
in
[the] day
of having taken hold of
by Me
the
hand
of them
to lead
them
out of
[the] land
of Egypt
because
they
not
did continue
in
the
covenant
of Me
and I
disregarded
them
says
[the] Lord
For
this [is]
the
covenant
that
I will make
with the
house
of Israel
after
the
days
those
says
[the] Lord
putting
Laws
of Me
into
the
mind
of them
and
upon
hearts
of them
I will inscribe
them
and
I will be
to them
for
God
and
they
will be
to Me
for
a people
And
no
not
shall they teach
each
the
neighbor
of him
and
each
the
brother
of him
saying
Know
the
Lord
because
all
will know
Me
from
[the] least
to [the]
greatest
of them
because
merciful
I will be
toward the
iniquities
of them
and
the
sins
of them
no
not
I shall remember
more
In
-
saying
new
He has made obsolete
the
first
that
then
growing old
and
aging
[is] near
vanishing
Had
indeed
therefore
also
the
first
regulations
of worship
-
and
a sanctuary
earthly
A tabernacle
for
was prepared
the
first [room]
in
which [were]
-
both
the lampstand
and
the
table
and
of the
presentation
the
bread
which
is called
[the] Holy [Place]
Behind
now
the
second
veil
[was] a tabernacle
-
being called
the Holy
of Holies
[the] golden
having
altar of incense
and
the
ark
of the
covenant
having been covered around
in every part
with gold
in
which
[was the] jar
golden
having
the
manna
and
the
staff
of Aaron
-
having budded
and
the
tablets
of the
covenant
Above
then
it
[were the] cherubim
of glory
overshadowing
the
mercy seat
concerning
which
not
it is
now [the time]
to speak
in
detail
These things
now
thus
having been prepared
into
indeed
the
first
tabernacle
at all times
everything
enter
the
priests
the
sacred services
accomplishing
[Enters] into
however
the
second
once
in the
year
only
the
high priest
not
without
blood
which
he offers
for
himself
and
the
of the
people
sins of ignorance
By this
was signifying
the
Spirit
-
Holy
[that] not yet
has been made manifest
the
into the
holy places
way
still
the
first
tabernacle
having
a standing
which [is]
a symbol
for
the
time
-
present
in
which
gifts
both
and
sacrifices
are offered
not
being able
in regard to
conscience
to make perfect
the [one]
worshiping
[consisting] only
in
foods
and
drinks
and
various
washings
ordinances
of [the] flesh
until
[the] time
of reformation
being imposed
Christ
however
having appeared as
high priest
of the
having come
good things
by
the
greater
and
more perfect
tabernacle
not
made by hands
that
is
not
of this
-
creation
nor
by
blood
of goats
and
calves
through
however
the
own
blood
He entered
once for all
into
the
holy places
eternal
redemption
having obtained
If
for
the
blood
of goats
and
of bulls
and
[the] ashes
of a heifer
sprinkling
the
having been defiled
sanctify [them]
for
the
of the
flesh
purification
how much
more
the
blood
-
of Christ
who
through
[the] Spirit
eternal
Himself
offered
unblemished
-
to God
will purify
the
conscience
of us
from
dead
works
in order
-
to serve
God
[the] living
And
because of
this
of a covenant
new
[the] mediator
He is
so that
death
having taken place
for
redemption
of the
under
the
first
covenant
transgressions
the
promise
might receive
those
having been called
of the
eternal
inheritance
Where
for
[there is] a will
[the] death
[it is] necessary
to establish
of the [one]
having made [it]
A will
for
after
death
[is] affirmed
since
not
at the time
it is in force
when
is living
the [one]
having made [it]
wherefore
neither
the
first
apart from
blood
has been inaugurated
Having been spoken
for
of every
commandment
according to
the
law
by
Moses
to all
the
people
having taken
the
blood
-
of calves
and
-
of goats
with
water
and
wool
scarlet
and
hyssop
itself
both
the
book
and
all
the
people
he sprinkled
saying
This [is]
the
blood
of the
covenant
which
commanded
unto
you
-
God
And
the
tabernacle
then
and
all
the
vessels
of the
ministry
with
blood
likewise
he sprinkled
And
almost
with
blood
all things
are purified
according to
the
law
and
apart from
blood-shedding
not
there is
forgiveness
[It was] necessary
then [for]
the
indeed
representations
of the things
in
the
heavens
with these
to be purified
themselves
however
the
heavenly things
with better
sacrifices
than
these
Not
for
into
made by hands
has entered
holy places
Christ
copies
of the
true [ones]
but
into
itself
-
heaven
now
to appear
in the
presence
-
of God
for
us
nor
that
repeatedly
He should offer
Himself
just as
the
high priest
enters
into
the
holy places
every
year
with
[the] blood
of another
Otherwise
it was necessary for
Him
repeatedly
to have suffered
from
[the] foundation
of [the] world
Now
however
once
in
[the] consummation
of the
ages
for
[the] putting away
of
sin
by
the
sacrifice
of Himself
He has been revealed
And
in
as much as
it is apportioned
-
to men
once
to die
after
then
this
[to face] judgment
so
also
-
Christ
once
having been offered
in order
-
of many
to bear
[the] sins
for
a second time
apart from
sin
will appear
to those
Him
awaiting
for
salvation
A shadow
for
having
the
law
of the
coming
good things
not
themselves
the
form
of the
things
each
year
with the
same
sacrifices
which
they offer
to
the
continuous
never
is able
those
drawing near
to perfect
Otherwise
not
-
would they have ceased
being offered
because of
-
none
having
any longer
conscience
of sins
those
serving
once
having been cleansed
But
in
these
[there is] a reminder
of sins
every
year
Impossible [it is]
indeed
[for the] blood
of bulls
and
of goats
to take away
sins
Therefore
coming
into
the
world
He says
Sacrifice
and
offering
not
You have desired
a body
however
You have prepared
me
Burnt offerings
and
[offerings] for
sin
not
You have delighted in
Then
I said
Behold
I have come
in
[the] scroll
of [the] book
it is written
of
Me
-
to do
-
O God
the
will
of You
Above
saying
-
Sacrifice
and
offering
and
burnt offerings
and
[offerings] for
sin
not
You have desired
nor
have You delighted in
which
according to
[the] Law
are offered
then
He said
Behold
I have come
-
to do
the
will
of You
He takes away
the
first
that
the
second
He might establish
By
that
will
having been sanctified
we are
through
the
offering
of the
body
of Jesus
Christ
once for all
And
every
indeed
priest
stands
every
day
ministering
and
the
same
repeatedly
offering
sacrifices
which
never
are able
to take away
sins
This [One]
however
one
for
sins
having offered
sacrifice
in
-
perpetuity
sat down
at
[the] right hand
-
of God
the
henceforth
awaiting
until
should be placed
the
enemies
of Him
[as] a footstool
for the
feet
of Him
By one
for
offering
He has perfected
for
-
all time
those
being sanctified
Bears witness
now
to us
also
the
Spirit
-
Holy
after
for
-
having said
This [is]
the
covenant
that
I will make
with
them
after
the
days
those
says
[the] Lord
putting
[the] laws
of Me
into
[the] hearts
of them
and
into
the
mind
of them
I will inscribe
them
and
The
sins
of them
and
the
lawless acts
of them
no
not
will I remember
any more
Where
now
forgiveness
of these [is]
no longer [is there]
an offering
for
sin
Having
therefore
brothers
confidence
for
the
entering
the
holy places
by
the
blood
of Jesus
which
He dedicated
for us
a way
new
and
living
through
the
veil
that
is
the
flesh
of Him
and [having]
a priest
great
over
the
house
-
of God
we should draw near
with
a sincere
heart
in
full assurance
of faith
having been sprinkled clean
[our]
hearts
from
a conscience
evil
and
having been washed
[our]
body
with water
pure
We should hold fast
to the
confession
of [our]
hope
firmly
faithful
for [is]
the [One]
having promised
And
we should think
one another
toward
stirring up
to love
and
to good
works
not
forsaking
the
assembling together
of ourselves
as
[is the] custom
with some
but
encouraging [one another]
and
so much
more
as
you see
drawing near
the
Day
[If] willingly
for
sin
we
after [we are]
-
to receive
the
knowledge
of the
truth
no longer
for
sins
remains
a sacrifice
terrifying
however
a certain
expectation
of judgment
and
of fire
fury
to devour
being about
the
adversaries
Having set aside
anyone
[the] law
of Moses
without
mercies
on the basis of
two
or
three
witnesses
he dies
How much
think you
worse
will he deserve
punishment
the [one]
the
Son
-
of God
having trampled upon
and
the
blood
of the
covenant
ordinary
having esteemed
by
which
he was sanctified
and
the
Spirit
-
of grace
having insulted
We know
for
the [One]
having said
Mine
[is] vengeance
I
will repay
and
again
Will judge
[the] Lord
the
people
of Him
[It is] a fearful thing
-
to fall
into
[the] hands
of God
[the] living
Remember
however
the
former
days
in
which
having been enlightened
a great
conflict
you endured
of sufferings
this
indeed
by revilings
both
and
tribulations
being made a spectacle
this
now
partners
of those
thus
passing through [them]
having become
Both
for
with the
prisoners
you sympathized
and
the
plundering
of the
possessions
of you
with
joy
you accepted
knowing
to have
yourselves
a better
possession
and
abiding
Not
throw away
therefore
the
boldness
of you
which
has
a great
reward
Of endurance
for
You have
need
so that
the
will
-
of God
having done
you may receive
the
promise
Yet
for
A little
very
while
the [One]
coming
will come
and
not
will delay
The one
however
righteous
of Mine
by
faith
will live
and
if
he might shrink back
not
takes pleasure
the
soul
of Me
in
him
We
however
not
are
of [those] drawing back
to
destruction
but
of faith
to
[the] preserving
[of the] soul
Is
now
faith
of [things] hoped for
[the] assurance
of things
[the] conviction
not
being seen
In
this
for
were commended
the
ancients
By faith
we understand
to have been formed
the
universe
by [the] word
of God
so that
which
not
from [things]
being visible
the things
being seen
have been made
By faith
a more excellent
sacrifice
Abel
than
Cain
offered
-
to God
through
which
he was testified
to be
righteous
bearing witness
to
the
gifts
of him
-
God
and
through
it
having died
still
he speaks
By faith
Enoch
was translated
-
not
to see
death
and
not
was he found
because
had taken up
him
-
God
Before
for
the
translation
he was commended
to have pleased
-
God
Without
now
faith
[it is] impossible
to please [Him]
To believe
for
it behooves
the one
drawing near
-
to God
that
He exists
and [that]
to those
earnestly seeking out
Him
a rewarder
He becomes
By faith
having been divinely instructed
Noah
concerning
the things
not yet
seen
having been moved with fear
prepared
an ark
for
[the] salvation
of the
household
of him
by
which
he condemned
the
world
and
of the
according to
faith
righteousness [that is]
he became
heir
By faith
being called
Abraham
obeyed
to go out
into
a place
that
he was going
to receive
for
an inheritance
and
went out
not
knowing
where
he is going
By faith
he sojourned
in
[the] land
of the
promise
as [in]
a foreign [country]
in
tents
having dwelt
with
Isaac
and
Jacob
the
joint-heirs
of the
promise
-
same
He was awaiting
for
the
-
foundations
having
city
of which
[the] architect
and
builder [is]
-
God
By faith
also
herself
Sarah
power
for
[the] conception
of seed
received
even
beyond
the opportune
age
since
faithful
she considered
the [One]
having promised
Therefore
also
from
one man
were born
and
he
having been as good as dead
as
the
stars
of
heaven
-
in multitude
and
as
the
sand
-
by
the
shore
of the
sea
-
countless
In
faith
died
these
all
not
having received
the
promises
but
from afar
them
having seen
and
having embraced [them]
and
having confessed
that
strangers
and
sojourners
they are
on
the
earth
Those
for
such things
saying
make manifest
that [their]
own country
they are seeking
And
if
indeed
that
they had been remembering
from
where
they came out
they would have had
-
opportunity
to return
Now
however
a better [one]
they stretch forward to
that
is
a heavenly [one]
Therefore
not
is ashamed of
them
-
God
God
to be called
of them
He has prepared
indeed
for them
a city
By faith
has offered up
Abraham
-
Isaac
Being tested
even
[his]
only begotten son
was offering up
the [one]
the
promises
having received
as to
whom
it was said
-
In
Isaac
will be reckoned
your
offspring
having reasoned
that
even
out from
[the] dead
to raise
able [was]
-
God
from where
him
also
in
a simile
he received
By faith
also
concerning
[the things] coming
blessed
Isaac
-
Jacob
and
-
Esau
By faith
Jacob
dying
each
of the
sons
of Joseph
blessed
and
worshiped
on
the
top
of the
staff
of him
By faith
Joseph
dying
concerning
the
exodus
of the
sons
of Israel
made mention
and
concerning
the
bones
of him
gave instructions
By faith
Moses
having been born
was hidden
three months
by
the
parents
of him
because
they saw
[was] beautiful
the
little child
and
not
they did fear
the
edict
of the
king
By faith
Moses
grown
having become
refused
to be called
[the] son
of [the] daughter
of Pharaoh
rather
having chosen
to suffer affliction with
the
people
-
of God
than
[the] temporary
to have
of sin
enjoyment
greater
wealth
having esteemed
than the
of Egypt
treasures
the
reproach
-
of Christ
he was looking
for
toward
the
reward
By faith
he left
Egypt
not
having feared
the
anger
of the
king
the
for
Invisible [One]
as
seeing
he persevered
By faith
he has kept
the
Passover
and
the
sprinkling
of the
blood
so that
not
the [one]
destroying
the
firstborn
would touch
them
By faith
they passed through
the
Red
Sea
as
through
dry
land
which
an attempt
having made
the
Egyptians
were swallowed up
By faith
the
walls
of Jericho
fell
having been encircled
for
seven
days
By faith
Rahab
the
prostitute
not
did perish with
those
having disobeyed
having received
the
spies
with
peace
And
what
more
shall I say
Will fail
me
for
telling
the
time
of
Gideon
Barak
Samson
Jephthah
David
also
and
Samuel
and
the
prophets
who
by
faith
conquered
kingdoms
administered
justice
obtained
promises
shut
[the] mouths
of lions
quenched
[the] power
of fire
escaped
[the] mouths
of [the] sword
acquired strength
out of
weakness
became
mighty
in
war
[the] armies
put to flight
of foreigners
Received back
women
by
resurrection
the
dead
of them
others
then
were tortured
not
having accepted
-
release
so that
a better
resurrection
they might obtain
Others
then
of mockings
and
of scourgings
trial
received
in addition
also
of chains
and
imprisonment
They were stoned
they were tried
they were sawed in two
by
slaughter
of [the] sword
they were killed
they wandered
in
sheepskins
in
goatsâ
skins
being destitute
being oppressed
being mistreated
of whom
not
was
worthy
the
world
in
deserts
wandering
and
mountains
and
caves
and
-
holes
of the
earth
And
these
all
having been commended
through
the
faith
not
did receive
the
promise
-
God
for
us
better
something
having planned
so that
not
apart from
us
they should be made perfect
Therefore
also
we
such a great
having
encompassing
us
a cloud
of witnesses
weight
having laid aside
every
and
the
easily entangling
sin
with
endurance
should run
the
lying before
us
race
looking
to
the
of [our]
faith
founder
and
perfecter
Jesus
who
in view of
the
lying before
Him
joy
endured
[the] cross
[its] shame
having despised
at
right hand
and
of the
throne
-
of God
sat down
Consider fully
for
the [One]
such great
having endured
from
-
sinners
against
Himself
hostility
so that
not
you shall grow weary
in the
souls
of you
fainting
Not yet
unto
blood
have you resisted
against
-
sin
struggling
and
you have forgotten
the
exhortation
that
you
as
to sons
addresses
Son
of Me
not
regard lightly
[the] discipline
of [the] Lord
nor
faint
by
Him
being reproved
Whom
for
He loves
[the] Lord
disciplines
He scourges
now
every
son
whom
He receives
As
discipline
endure
as
sons
you
is treating
-
God
what
for
son [is there]
whom
not
disciplines
[his] father
If
however
without
you are
of discipline
of which
partakers
they have become
all
then
illegitimate children
and
not
sons
you are
Furthermore
-
indeed
of the
flesh
of us
fathers
we have had
correctors
and
we respected [them]
not
much
more
shall we be in subjection
to the
Father
-
of spirits
and
shall live
-
Truly
indeed
for
a few
days
according to
that
seeming good
to them
they were disciplining [us]
-
but [He]
for
[our]
benefitting
in order
-
to share
of the
holiness
of Him
All
now
discipline
for
indeed
those
being present
not
seems
of joy
to be
but
of grief
afterward
however
[the] fruit
peaceable
to those
by
it
having been trained
it yields
of righteousness
Therefore
the
drooping
hands
and
the
enfeebled
knees
lift up
and
paths
straight
make
for the
feet
of you
so that
not
the
lame
should be put out of joint
should be healed
however
rather
Peace
pursue
with
all
and
-
holiness
which
without
no one
will see
the
Lord
observing
lest
any
be failing
of
the
grace
-
of God
lest
any
root
of bitterness
up
springing
should trouble [you]
and
by
this
might be defiled
the
many
lest [there be]
any
fornicator
or
profane person
as
Esau
who
for
meal
one
sold
the
birthright
of himself
You know
for
that
even
afterward
wishing
to inherit
the
blessing
he was rejected
of repentance
for
place
not
he found
although
with
tears
having earnestly sought
it
Not
for
you have come to
[that] being touched
and
having been kindled
with fire
and
to darkness
and
to gloom
and
to storm
and
of a trumpet
to [the] sound
and
to a voice
of words
which
those
having heard
excused themselves
[asking] not
to be addressed
to them
[the] word
not
they could bear
for
that
being commanded
If even
a beast
should touch
the
mountain
it shall be stoned
And
so
fearful
was
the thing
appearing [that]
Moses
said
Greatly afraid
I am
and
trembling
But
you have come to
Zion
Mount
and
[the] city
of God
[the] living
[the] Jerusalem
heavenly
and
to myriads
of angels
[to the] assembly
and
to [the] church
of [the] firstborn
having been enrolled
in
[the] heavens
and
to [the] judge
God
of all
and
to [the] spirits
of [the] righteous
having been perfected
and
of a covenant
new
[the] mediator
to Jesus
and
to [the] blood
of sprinkling
better things
speaking
than
that of
Abel
Take heed
lest
you refuse
the [One]
speaking
If
for
they
not
escaped
on
earth
having refused
the [One]
divinely instructing [them]
much
less
we
-
the [One]
from
[the] heavens
turning away from
whose
-
voice
the
earth
shook
at that time
now
however
He has promised
saying
Yet
once [more]
I
will shake
not
only
the
earth
but
also
-
heaven
This
now
Yet
once [more]
signifies
the
of the [things]
being shaken
removing
as
having been created
so that
should remain
the things
not
being shaken
Therefore
a kingdom
not to be shaken
receiving
we may have
grace
by
which
we may serve
well pleasingly
-
God
with
reverence
and
awe
Also
for
the
God
of us
[is] a fire
consuming
-
Brotherly love
let abide
-
Of hospitality
not
be forgetful
through
this
for
unawares
some
have entertained
angels
Remember
-
prisoners
as
being bound with [them]
those
being mistreated
as
also
yourselves
being
in
[the] body
Honorable [let]
-
marriage [be]
in
all
and
the
marriage bed
undefiled
the sexually immoral
for
and
adulterers
will judge
-
God
[Let be] without covetousness
[your]
manner of life
being satisfied
with the
present
He Himself
for
has said
Never
not
you
will I leave
nor
never
not
you
will I forsake
So
are confident
we
to say
[The] Lord [is]
my
helper
not
I will be afraid
what
shall do
to me
man
Remember
those
leading
you
who
spoke
to you
the
word
-
of God
of whom
considering
the
outcome
of [their]
way of life
imitate
the
faith
Jesus
Christ
yesterday
and
today
[is] the
same
and
to
the
ages
By teachings
various
and
strange
not
be carried away
[it is] good
for
by grace
to be strengthened
for the
heart
not
foods
in
which
not
were profited
those
being devoted
We have
an altar
from
which
to eat
not
have
authority
those
in the
tabernacle
serving
Whose
for
is brought
of animals
the
blood [as sacrifices]
for
sin
into
the
holy places
by
the
high priest
of those
the
bodies
are burned
outside
the
camp
Therefore
also
Jesus
so that
he might sanctify
by
the
own
blood
the
people
outside
the
gate
suffered
Therefore
we should go forth
to
Him
outside
the
camp
the
reproach
of Him
bearing
Not
for
we have
here
an abiding
city
but
the
coming [one]
we are seeking for
Through
Him
then
we should offer
[the] sacrifice
of praise
through
everything
to
God
that
is
[the] fruit
of [the] lips
confessing
the
name
of Him
-
And
the good
and
of sharing
not
be forgetful
with such
for
sacrifices
is well pleased
-
God
Obey
those
leading
you
and
be submissive
they
for
watch
over
the
souls
of you
as
account
about to give
that
with
joy
this
they might do
and
not
groaning
unprofitable
indeed
for you [is]
this
Pray
for
us
we are persuaded
for
that
a good
conscience
we have
in
all things
well
desiring
to conduct ourselves
More abundantly
now
I exhort [you]
this
to do
so that
more quickly
I may be restored
to you
[May] the
now
God

of peace

having brought
out from
[the] dead
the
Shepherd
of the
sheep

you
in
everything
good
in order
-
to do
the
will
of Him
working
in
us
that which [is]
well pleasing
before
Him
through
Jesus
Christ
to whom [be]
the
glory
to
the
ages
of the
ages
Amen
I exhort
now
you
brothers
bear with
the
word
-
of exhortation
only
for
in
few words
I have written
to you
You know
the
brother
of us
Timothy
has been released
with
whom
if
sooner
he should come
I will see
you
Greet
all

all
the
saints
Greet

James
of God
and
of [the] Lord
Jesus

To the
twelve
tribes

in
the
Dispersion
Greetings
All
joy
esteem [it]
brothers
of me
when
trials
you might fall into
various
knowing
that
the
testing
of your
-
faith
produces
endurance
-
And
endurance
work
[its] perfect
let have
so that
you may be
perfect
and
complete
in
nothing
lacking
If
now
any
of you
lacks
wisdom
let him ask
from
the [One]
giving
God
to all
generously
and
not
finding fault
and
it will be given
to him
Let him ask
however
in
faith
nothing
doubting
The [one]
for
doubting
is like
a wave
of [the] sea
being blown by the wind
and
being tossed by the wind
Not
for
let suppose
the
man
that
that
he will receive
anything
from
the
Lord
[He is] a man
double-minded
unstable
in
all
the
ways
of him
Let boast
however
the
brother
-
of low degree
in
the
exaltation
of him
he who [is]
then
rich
in
the
humiliation
of him
because
like
a flower
of grass
he will pass away
Has risen
for
the
sun
with
[its]
burning heat
and
withered
the
grass
and
the
flower
of it
has fallen
and
the
beauty
of the
appearance
of it
has perished
Thus
also
the
rich [man]
in the midst of
the
pursuits
of him
will fade away
Blessed [is the]
man
who
endures
trial
because
approved
having been
he will receive
the
crown
-
of life
that
He has promised
to those
loving
Him
No one
being tempted
let say
-
By
God
I am being tempted
-
For
God
unable to be tempted
is
by evils
tempts
now
He Himself
no one
A man
however
is tempted
by
the
own
desire
being drawn away
and
being enticed
Then
-
desire
having conceived
gives birth to
sin
-
and
sin
having become fully grown
brings forth
death
Not
be misled
brothers
my
beloved
Every
act of giving
good
and
every
gift
perfect
from above
is
coming down
from
the
Father
-
of lights
with
whom
not
there is
variation
or
of shifting
shadow
Having willed [it]
He brought forth
us
by [the] word
of truth
for
-
to be
us
firstfruits
a certain
-
of His
creatures
Know [this]
brothers
my
beloved
Let be
however
every
man
swift
unto
-
to hear
slow
unto
-
to speak
slow
unto
anger
[the] anger
for
of man
[the] righteousness
of God
not
produces
Therefore
having put aside
all
filthiness
and
abounding
of wickedness
in
humility
receive
the
implanted
word
-
being able
to save
the
souls
of you
Be
however
doers
of [the] word
and
not
hearers
only
deceiving
yourselves
because
if
anyone
a hearer
of [the] word
is
and
not
a doer
this one
is like
a man
looking
at
[the] face
-
natural
of him
in
a mirror
he has viewed
for
himself
and
has gone away
and
immediately
he has forgotten
what like
he was
The [one]
however
having looked intently
into
[the] law
perfect
that
-
of freedom
and
having continued in [it]
not
a hearer
forgetful
having been
but
a doer
of [the] work
this one
blessed
in
the
work
of him
will be
If
anyone
seems
religious
to be
not
bridling
[the] tongue
of himself
but
deceiving
[the] heart
of himself
of this one
worthless [is]
the
religion
Religion
pure
and
undefiled
before
the
God
and
Father
this
is
to visit
orphans
and
widows
in
the
tribulation
of them
unstained
oneself
to keep
from
the
world
Brothers
of Me
not
with
partiality
hold
the
faith
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
-
of glory
If
for
might come
into
assembly
of you
a man
with a gold ring
in
apparel
splendid
might come in
then
also
a poor [man]
in
shabby
apparel
you should look
also
upon
the [one]
wearing
the
apparel
-
splendid
and
should say
You
sit you
here
honorably
and
to the
poor
should say
You
stand
there
or
Sit
under
the
footstool
of me
not
have you made a distinction
among
yourselves
and
have become
judges [with]
thoughts
evil
Listen
brothers
my
beloved
Not
-
God
has chosen
the
poor
-
in this world
[to be] rich
in
faith
and
heirs
of the
kingdom
that
He promised
to those
loving
Him
You
however
have dishonored
the
poor
Not
the
rich
are oppressing
you
and
they
dragging
you
into
court
Not
they
are blaspheming
the
good
Name
-
having been called
upon
you
If
indeed
[the] law
you keep
royal
according to
the
Scripture
You shall love
the
neighbor
of you
as
yourself
well
you are doing
If
however
you show partiality
sin
you are committing
being convicted
by
the
law
as
transgressors
Whoever
for
all
the
law
shall keep
shall stumble
but
in
one [point]
he has become
of all
guilty
The [One]
for
having said
Not
you shall commit adultery
said
also
Not
you shall murder
If
however
not
you do commit adultery
do commit murder
however
you have become
a transgressor
of [the] law
So
speak
and
so
act
as
by
[the] law
of freedom
being about
to be judged
-
For
judgment
without mercy [will be]
to the [one]
not
having shown
mercy
Triumphs over
mercy
judgment
What [is]
the
profit
brothers
of me
if
faith
says
anyone
to have
works
however
not
he has
Not
is able
the
faith
to save
him
Now if
a brother
or
a sister
without clothes
is
and
lacking
-
of daily
food
says
then
anyone
to them
out from
you
Go
in
peace
be warmed
and
be filled
not
gives
however
to them
the
needful things
for the
body
what [is]
the
profit
So
also
-
faith
if
not
it has
works
dead
is
by
itself
But
will say
someone
You
faith
have
and I
works
have
Show
me
the
faith
of you
without
-
works
and I
you
will show
by
the
works
of me
-
faith
You
believe
that
one
is
-
God
Well
you are doing
Even
the
demons
believe [that]
and
shudder
Do you want
however
to come to know
O
man
foolish
that
-
faith
apart from
-
works
worthless
is
Abraham
the
father
of us
not
by
works
was justified
having offered
Isaac
the
son
of him
upon
the
altar
You see
that
[his]
faith
was working with
the
works
of him
and
by
[his]
works
[his]
faith
was perfected
And
was fulfilled
the
Scripture
-
saying
Believed
then
Abraham
-
God
and
it was counted
to him
for
righteousness
and
a friend
of God
he was called
You see
that
by
works
is justified
a man
and
not
by
faith
alone
Likewise
then
also
Rahab
the
prostitute
not
by
works
was justified
having received
the
messengers
and
by another
way
having sent [them] forth
Just as
for
the
body
apart from
spirit
dead
is
so
also
-
faith
apart from
works
dead
is
Not
many [of you]
teachers
let be
brothers
of mine
knowing
that
greater
judgment
we will receive
In many ways
for
we stumble
all
If
anyone
in
what he says
not
does stumble
this one [is]
a perfect
man
able
to bridle
indeed
all
the
body
If
now
of the
horses
-
bits
into
the
mouths
we put
for
-
to obey
them
us
even
all
the
body
of them
we turn about
Behold
also
the
ships
so great
being
and
by
winds
strong
being driven
are turned about
by
a very small
rudder
wherever
the
impulse
of the [one]
steering
resolves
Thus
also
the
tongue
a small
member
is
and
exceeding things
it boasts
Behold
a small
fire
how great
a forest
it kindles
Also
the
tongue [is]
a fire
the
world
-
of iniquity
The
tongue
is set
among
the
members
of us
-
defiling
all
the
body
and
setting on fire
the
course
-
of nature
and [itself]
being set on fire
by
-
hell
All
for
kinds
of beasts
both
and
of birds
of creeping things
both
and
things of the sea
is subdued
and
has been subdued
by the
race
of the
human
-
but
the tongue
no one
to subdue
is able
of men
[it is] an unruly
evil
full
of poison
deadly
With
it
we bless
our
Lord
and
Father
and
with
it
we curse
-
men
those
according to
[the] likeness
of God
being made
Out of
the
same
mouth
proceed forth
blessing
and
cursing
Not
ought
brothers
of Me
these things
so
to be
Not
the
spring
out
of the
same
opening
pours forth
-
[both] fresh
and
-
bitter
Not
is able
brothers
of me
a fig tree
olives
to produce
Or
a vine
figs
Nor
a salt [spring]
fresh
to produce
water
Who
[is] wise
and
understanding
among
you
let him show
out of
the
good
conduct
the
works
of him
in
[the] humility
of wisdom
If
however
jealousy
bitter
you have
and
self-interest
in
the
heart
of you
not
boast [of it]
and
lie
against
the
truth
Not
is
this
the
wisdom
from above
coming down
but
[is] earthly
unspiritual
demonic
Where
for
jealousy
and
self-interest [exist]
there [will be]
disorder
and
every
evil
thing
-
But
the from above
wisdom
first
indeed
pure
is
then
peaceable
gentle
reasonable
full
of mercy
and
of fruits
good
impartial
sincere
[The] fruit
now
of righteousness
in
peace
is sown
by those
making
peace
From where
[come] disputes
and
from where
quarrels
among
you
[Is it] not
from there
out of
the
passions
of you
-
warring
in
the
members
of you
You desire
and
not
have
you kill
and
covet
and
not
are able
to obtain
You quarrel
and
wrangle
Not
you have
because
-
not
ask
you
You ask
and
not
receive
because
wrongly
you ask
that
in
the
pleasures
of you
you may spend [it]
Adulteresses
Not
know you
that
the
friendship
with the
world
hostility
[with]
God
is
Whoever
if
therefore
has chosen
a friend
to be
of the
world
an enemy
-
of God
is appointed
Or
think you
that
in vain
the
Scripture
says
With
envy
yearns
the
Spirit
that
He has made to dwell
in
us
Greater
however
He gives
grace
Therefore
it says
-
God
[the] proud
opposes
to [the] humble
however
gives
grace
Subject yourselves
therefore
-
to God
Resist
however
the
devil
and
he will flee
from
you
Draw near
-
to God
and
He will draw near
to you
Cleanse
[your] hands
[you] sinners
and
have purified
hearts
[you] double-minded
Be grieved
and
mourn
and
weep
The
laughter
of you
to
mourning
let be turned
and
the
joy
to
gloom
Humble yourselves
in the presence of
[the] Lord
and
He will exalt
you
Not
speak against
one another
brothers
The [one]
speaking against
[his] brother
or
judging
the
brother
of him
speaks against
[the] Law
and
judges
[the] Law
If
however
[the] Law
you judge
not
you are
a doer
of [the] Law
but
a judge
One
there is
Lawgiver
and
Judge
the [One]
being able
to save
and
to destroy
You
however
who
are
-
judging
the
neighbor
Come
now
those
saying
Today
or
tomorrow
we will go
into
such
-
city
and
will spend
there
a year
and
will trade
and
will make a profit
who
not
know
on the
next day [is]
What [is]
the
life
of you
A vapor
just
it is
-
for
a little [while]
appearing
then
also
vanishing
Instead [ought]
-
to say
you
If
the
Lord
should will
both
we will live
and
we will do
this
or
that
Now
however
you boast
in
the
arrogance
of you
All
boasting
such
evil
is
To [him] knowing
therefore
good
to do
and
not
doing
sin
to him
it is
Come
now
[you]
rich
weep
wailing
over
the
miseries
upon you
that [are]
coming
The
riches
of You
have rotted
and
the
garments
of you
moth-eaten
have become
The
gold
of you
and
the
silver
have corroded
and
the
rust
of them
for
a testimony
against you
will be
and
will eat
the
flesh
of you
like
fire
You have treasured up
in
[the] last
days
Behold
the
wage
of the
workmen
-
having harvested
the
fields
of you
-
having been kept back
by
you
cries out
and
the
cries
of those
having harvested
into
the
ears
of [the] Lord
of Hosts
have entered
You lived in luxury
upon
the
earth
and
lived in self-indulgence
You have fattened
the
hearts
of you
in
[the] day
of slaughter
You have condemned
[and] have put to death
the
righteous
not
does he resist
you
Be patient
therefore
brothers
until
the
coming
of the
Lord
Behold
the
farmer
awaits
the
precious
fruit
of the
earth
being patient
for
it
until
it receives
[the] early
and
latter [rains]
Be patient
also
you
strengthen
the
hearts
of you
because
the
coming
of the
Lord
has drawn near
Not
grumble
brothers
against
one another
so that
not
you may be condemned
Behold
the
Judge
before
the
doors
is standing
[As] an example
take
brothers
-
of suffering evils
and
-
of patience
the
prophets
who
spoke
in
the
name
of [the] Lord
Behold
we count blessed
those
having persevered
The
perseverance
of Job
you have heard of
and
the
outcome
from [the] Lord
you have seen
that
full of compassion
is
the
Lord
and
[is] merciful
Before
all things
however
brothers
of me
not
swear
neither [by]
-
heaven
nor
the
earth
nor
other
any
oath
Be
however
of you
the
Yes
yes
and
the
No
no
so that
not
under
judgment
you might fall
Is suffering hardships
anyone
among
you
Let him pray
Is cheerful
anyone
Let him sing praises
Is sick
anyone
among
you
Let him call near
the
elders
of the
church
and
let them pray
over
him
having anointed
with oil
in
the
name
of the
Lord
And
the
prayer
-
of faith
will save
the one
ailing
and
will raise up
him
the
Lord
and if
sins
he might be [one]
having committed
it will be forgiven
him
Confess
therefore
to one another
the
sins
and
pray
for
one another
so that
you may be healed
Much
prevails
[the] prayer
of a righteous [man]
being made effective
Elijah
a man
was
of like nature
to us
and
with fervent prayer
he prayed [for it]
-
not
to rain
and
not
it did rain
upon
the
earth
years
three
and
months
six
And
again
he prayed
and
the
heaven
rain
gave
and
the
earth
produced
the
fruit
of it
Brothers
of Me
if
anyone
among
you
might wander
from
the
truth
and
should bring back
someone
him
let him know
that
the [one]
having brought back
a sinner
from
[the] error
of the way
of him
will save
the soul
of him
from
death
and
will cover over
a multitude
of sins

inexpressible
and
filled with glory
receiving
the
outcome
of the
faith
[the] salvation
of [your] souls
Concerning
this
salvation
sought out
and
searched out diligently
[the] prophets
-
of
the
toward
you
grace
having prophesied
inquiring
into
what
or
what manner of
time
was signifying
the
in
them
Spirit
of Christ
testifying beforehand
-
unto
Christ's
sufferings
and
the
after
these
glories
to whom
it was revealed
that
not
themselves
you
however
they were serving
in those things
which
now
have been proclaimed
to you
by
those
having proclaimed the gospel to
you
by
[the] Spirit
Holy
having been sent
from
heaven
into
which
desire
angels
to look
Therefore
having girded up
the
loins
of the
mind
of you
being sober-minded
fully
set [your] hope
upon
the
being brought
to you
grace
in
[the] revelation
of Jesus
Christ
as
children
of obedience
not
fashioning yourselves
to the
former
in
the
ignorance
of you
desires
But
as
the [One]
having called
you
[is] holy
also
yourselves
holy
in
all
[your] conduct
be
because
it has been written
Holy
you shall be
because
I
holy
And
if
[as] Father
you call on
the [One]
impartially
judging
according to
the
of each
work
in
fear
during the
of the
sojourn
of you
time
conduct yourselves
knowing
that
not
by perishable things
by silver
or
by gold
you were redeemed
from
the
futile
of you
manner of life
handed down from [your] fathers
but
by [the] precious
blood
as
of a lamb
without blemish
and
without spot
of Christ
having been foreknown
indeed
before
[the] foundation
of [the] world
having been revealed
however
in
[the] last
-
times
for the sake of
you
who
by
Him
believe
in
God
the [one]
having raised up
Him
out from
[the] dead
and
glory
Him
having given
so as for
the
faith
of you
and
hope
to be
in
God
The
souls
of you
having purified
by
-
obedience
to the
truth
unto
brotherly love
sincere
out of
of heart
one another
love
fervently
Having been born again
not
of
seed
perishable
but
of imperishable
by
[the] word
living
of God
and
abiding
because
All
flesh [is]
like
grass
and
all
[the] glory
of it
like
[the] flower
of grass
Withers
the
grass
and
the
flower
falls away
-
but
the word
of [the] Lord
abides
to
the
age
This
now
is
the
word
-
having been proclaimed
to
you
Having put aside
therefore
all
malice
and
all
deceit
and
hypocrisy
and
envies
and
all
evil speakings
like
newborn
babies
-
reasonable
pure
milk
crave
so that
by
it
you may grow up
in respect to
salvation
if indeed
you have tasted
that
[is] good
the
Lord
To
whom
coming
a stone
living
by
men
indeed
rejected
in the sight of
however
God
chosen
[and] precious
also
you yourselves
as
stones
living
are being built up
as a house
spiritual
into
a priesthood
holy
to offer
spiritual
sacrifices
acceptable
to God
through
Jesus
Christ
Therefore
it is contained
in
Scripture
Behold
I lay
in
Zion
a stone
a chosen
cornerstone
precious
and
the [one]
believing
on
Him
no
not
shall be put to shame
To you
therefore [is]
the
preciousness
-
believing
[to those] disobeying
however
[The] stone
which
have rejected
those
building
this
has become
into
[the] head
of [the] corner
and
A stone
of stumbling
and
a rock
of offense
[They]
stumble at
to the
word
being disobedient
to
which
also
they were appointed
You
however
[are] a race
chosen
a royal
priesthood
a nation
holy
a people
for [His]
possession
so that
the
excellencies
you may proclaim
of the [One]
out of
darkness
you
having called
to
the
marvelous
of Him
light
who
once [were]
not
a people
now
however
[the] people
of God
those
not
having received mercy
now
however
having received mercy
Beloved
I exhort [you]
as
aliens
and
sojourners
to abstain
from
fleshly
desires
which
war
against
the
soul
the
conduct
of you
among
the
Gentiles
keeping
honorable
so that
wherein
which
they speak against
you
as
evildoers
through
the
good
deeds
having witnessed
they may glorify
-
God
in
[the] day
of visitation
Be in subjection
to every
human
institution
for the sake of
the
Lord
whether
to [the] king
as
being supreme
or
to governors
as
by
him
being sent
for
vengeance
to evildoers
praise
then
to well doers
because
this
is
the
will
-
of God
doing good
to put to silence
the
-
of foolish
men
ignorance
as
free
and
not
as
a cover-up
having
for
evil
the
freedom
but
as
of God
servants
Everyone
honor
The
brotherhood
love
-
God
fear
the
king
honor
-
Servants
be subject
with
all
fear
to
masters
not
only
to the
good
and
gentle
but
also
to the
unreasonable
This
for
[is] acceptable
if
for sake of
conscience
toward God
endures
anyone
griefs
suffering
unjustly
What kind of
for
credit [is it]
if
sinning
and
being struck
you shall endure
But
if
doing good
and
suffering
you shall endure
this [is]
commendable
before
God
To this
hereunto
for
you have been called
because
also
Christ
suffered
for
you
you
leaving
an example
that
you should follow after
the
steps
of Him
Who
sin
not
committed
neither
was found
trickery
in
the
mouth
of Him
Who
being reviled
not
reviled in return
suffering
not
threatened
He gave [Himself] over
however
to Him
judging
justly
Who
the
sins
of us
Himself
bore
in
the
body
of Him
on
the
tree
so that
-
to sins
having been dead
-
to righteousness
we might live
By whose
-
wounds
you have been healed
You were
for
like
sheep
going astray
but
you have returned
now
to
the
Shepherd
and
Overseer
of the
souls
of you
Likewise
wives
be subject
to the
own
husbands
so that
even
if
any
are disobedient
to the
word
by
the
of the
wives
conduct
without
word
they will be won over
having witnessed
the
in
respect
pure
conduct
of you
whose
let it be
not
the
external
of braiding
of hair
and
putting around
of gold
or
putting on
of garments
adorning
but
the
hidden
of the
heart
man
in
the
imperishable
of the
gentle
and
quiet
spirit
which
is
before
-
God
of great worth
In this way
for
formerly
also
the
holy
women
-
hoping
in
God
used to adorn
themselves
being subject
to the
own
husbands
as
Sarah
obeyed
-
Abraham
lord
him
calling
of whom
you have become
children
doing good
and
not
fearing
not one
consternation
-
Husbands
likewise
dwelling with [them]
according to
knowledge
as
with a weaker
vessel
with the
female
rendering
honor
as
also
joint-heirs
of [the] grace
of life
so as for
-
not
to be hindered
the
prayers
of you
-
Now
the end
All [be]
single-minded
sympathetic
loving as brothers
tender-hearted
humble
not
repaying
evil
for
evil
or
insult
for
insult
on the contrary
however
blessing
because
to
this
you were called
so that
blessing
you should inherit
The [one]
for
desiring
life
to love
and
to see
days
good
let him keep
the
tongue
from
evil
and
lips
-
not
to speak
deceit
Let him turn away
also
from
evil
and
let him do
good
Let him seek
peace
and
let him pursue
it
Because
[the] eyes
of [the] Lord
[are] on
[the] righteous
and
[the] ears
of Him
toward
prayer
of them
[The] face
however
of [the] Lord
[is] against
those doing
evil
And
who [is]
he who
will harm
you
if
for that which [is]
good
zealous
you should be
But
if
even
you should suffer
because of
righteousness
[you are] blessed
-
And
the threats
of them
not
you should be afraid of
neither
should you be troubled
[As] Lord
however
-
Christ
sanctify
in
the
hearts
of you
ready
always
for
a defense
to everyone
-
asking
you
an account
concerning
the
in
you
hope
yet
with
gentleness
and
fear
a conscience
having
good
so that
in
this
they might speak against you
they shall be ashamed
those
reviling
your
-
good
in
Christ
manner of life
[It is] better
for
doing good
if
wills [it]
the
will
-
of God
to suffer
than
doing evil
because
also
Christ
once
for
sins
suffered
[the] righteous
for
[the] unrighteous
so that
you
He might bring
-
to God
having been put to death
indeed
in [the] flesh
having been made alive
however
in [the] spirit
in
which
also
to the
in
prison
spirits
having gone
He preached
having disobeyed
at one time
when
was waiting
the
-
of God
longsuffering
in
[the] days
of Noah
being prepared
of [the] ark
in
which
a few
that
is
eight
souls
were saved
through
water
which
also
you
prefigures
now
saving
baptism
not
of flesh
a putting away
of [the] filth
but
of a conscience
good
[the] demand
toward
God
through
[the] resurrection
of Jesus
Christ
who
is
at
[the] right hand
of God
having gone
into
heaven
having been subjected
to Him
angels
and
authorities
and
powers
Christ
therefore
having suffered
in [the] flesh
also
you
the
same
mind
arm yourselves with
because
the [one]
having suffered
[in the] flesh
is done with
sin
so as
-
no longer
to menâs
desires
but
to [the] will
of God
the
remaining
in
[the] flesh
to live
time
[Is] sufficient
for
the
past
time
the
desire
of the
Gentiles
to have carried out
having walked
in
sensuality
lusts
drunkenness
orgies
carousing
and
abominable
idolatries
With respect to
this
they think it strange
not
running with [them]
of you
into
the
same
-
of debauchery
overflow
speaking evil [of you]
who
will give
account
to Him who
ready
is
to judge
[the] living
and
[the] dead
To
this [end]
indeed
even
to [the] dead
the gospel was proclaimed
so that
they might be judged
indeed
according to
men
in [the] flesh
they might live
however
according to
God
in [the] spirit
Of all
now
the
end
has drawn near
Be clear minded
therefore
and
sober
for the purpose of
prayers
above
all things
-
among
yourselves
love
fervent
having
because
love
covers over
a multitude
of sins
hospitable
to
one another
without
complaint
each
as
has received
a gift
to
each other
them
serving
as
good
stewards
of [the] manifold
grace
of God
if
anyone
speaks
as
oracles
of God
if
anyone
serves
as
of
strength
which
supplies
-
God
so that
in
all things
may be glorified
-
God
through
Jesus
Christ
to whom
be
the
glory
and
the
power
to
the
ages
of the
ages
Amen
Beloved
not
be surprised at
the
among
you
fire
for
a trial
to you
taking place
as if
a strange thing
to you
were happening
But
as
you have shared
in the
-
of Christ
sufferings
rejoice
so that
also
in
the
revelation
of the
glory
of Him
you may rejoice
exulting
If
you are insulted
in
[the] name
of Christ
[you are] blessed
because
the
-
of glory
and
-
-
of God
Spirit
upon
you
rests
Not
for
any
of you
let suffer
as
a murderer
or
a thief
or
an evildoer
or
as
a troublesome meddler
if
however
as
a Christian
not
let him be ashamed
let him glorify
however
-
God
in
the
name
this
For [it is]
the
time [for]
-
to have begun
the
judgment
from
the
house
-
of God
if
now
first
from
us
what [will be]
the
outcome
of those
disobeying
the
-
of God
gospel
And
If
the
righteous [one]
with difficulty
is saved
the
ungodly
and
sinner
where
will appear
Therefore
also
those
suffering
according to
the
will
-
of God
to [the] faithful
Creator
let them commit
the
souls
of them
in
well doing
Elders
-
among
you
I exhort
-
a fellow elder
and
witness
of the
-
of Christ
sufferings
who [am]
also
of the
being about
to be revealed
glory
partaker
Shepherd
the
among
you
flock
-
of God
not
under compulsion
but
willingly
according to
God
and not
for base gain
but
eagerly
not
as
exercising lordship over
-
those in your charge
but
examples
being
to the
flock
And
having been revealed
the
Chief Shepherd
you will receive
the
unfading
-
of glory
crown
Likewise
younger [ones]
be subject
to [your] elders
All
now
one to another
-
humility
gird on
because
-
God
[the] proud
opposes
to [the] humble
however
He gives
grace
Be humbled
therefore
under
the
mighty
hand
-
of God
so that
you
He may exalt
in
[due] time
all
the
anxiety
of you
having cast
upon
Him
because
with Him
there is care
about
you
Be sober-minded
watch
The
adversary
of You
[the] devil
as
a lion
roaring
prowls about
seeking
whom
to devour
whom
you should resist
firm
in the
faith
knowing
the
same
-
sufferings
-
throughout
the
world
in your
brotherhood
to be accomplished
The
now
God
of all
grace
the [one]
having called
you
to
the
eternal
of Him
glory
in
Christ
a little while
[of you] having suffered
He Himself
will perfect
will confirm
will strengthen
[and] will establish [you]
To Him [be]
the
power
to
the
ages
of the
ages
Amen
Through
Silvanus
to you
the
faithful
brother
as
I regard [him]
through
few [words]
I have written
exhorting
and
testifying
this
to be
[the] true
grace
-
of God
in
which
you stand
Greets
you

Babylon

Greet
one another

of love
Peace [be]
to you
all
who [are]
in
Christ
Simon
Peter
a servant
and
apostle
of Jesus
Christ
To those
equally precious
with ours
having obtained
a faith
through
[the] righteousness
of the
God
of us
and
Savior
Jesus
Christ
Grace
to you
and
peace
be multiplied
in
[the] knowledge
-
of God
and
of Jesus
the
Lord
of us
Accordingly
-
all things
to us
the
divine
power
of Him
-
toward
life
and
godliness
has given
through
the
knowledge
of the [One]
having called
us
[by His] own
glory
and
excellence
through
which
the
precious
and
magnificent
to us
promises
He has given
so that
through
these
you might become
of [the] divine
partakers
nature
having escaped
the
in
the
world
in
desire
decay
And
very [reason]
for this
now
earnestness
all
having brought in
supplement
into
the
faith
of you
-
virtue
into
and

These things
for
in you
being
and
abounding
neither
idle
nor
unfruitful
make [you]
as to
the
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
knowledge
In whomever
for
not
are present
these things
blind
he is
being short sighted
forgetfulness
having received
of the
purification
the
former
of him
sins
Therefore
rather
brothers
be diligent
sure
your
-
calling
and
election
to make
these things
for
practicing
never
not
shall you stumble
at any time
In this way
for
richly
will be supplied
to you
the
entrance
into
the
eternal
kingdom
of the
Lord
of us
and
Savior
Jesus
Christ
Therefore
I will be ready
always
you
to remind
concerning
these things
though
knowing [them]
and
having been strengthened
in
the
being present [in you]
truth
Right
now
I esteem it
as
long as
I am
in
this
-
tabernacle
to stir up
you
by
putting [you] in remembrance
knowing
that
impending
is
the
putting off
of the
tabernacle
of me
as
also
the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
has made clear
to me
I will be diligent
now
also
at every time
to have
for you
after
-
my
departure
-
these things
a lasting remembrance
to make
Not
for
cleverly devised
fables
having followed out
we have made known
to you
the
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
power
and
coming
but
eyewitnesses
having been
-
of His
majesty
Having received
for
from
God
[the] Father
honor
and
glory
a voice
was brought
to Him
such as follows
by
the
Majestic
Glory
The
Son
of Me
-
beloved
of Me
this
is
in
whom
I
have found delight
And
this
-
voice
we
heard
from
heaven
having been brought
with
Him
being
in
the
holy
mountain
And
we have
more certain
the
prophetic
word
to which
well
you do
taking heed
as
to a lamp
shining
in
[a] dark
place
until
this
day
shall have dawned
and
[the] morning star
shall have arisen
in
the
hearts
of you
this
first
knowing
that
any
prophecy
of Scripture
of its own
interpretation
not
is
Not
for
by [the] will
of man
was brought
prophecy
at any time
but
by
[the] Spirit
Holy
being carried
spoke
from
God
men
There were
however
also
false prophets
among
the
people
as
also
among
you
there will be
false teachers
who
will stealthily introduce
heresies
destructive
even
the
having bought
them
Master
denying
bringing upon
themselves
swift
destruction
And
many
will follow after
their
-
sensuality
through
whom
the
way
of the
truth
will be maligned
And
through
covetousness
with fabricated
words
you
they will exploit
for whom
the
judgment
of long ago
not
is idle
and
the
destruction
of them
not
slumbers
If
for
-
God
[the] angels
having sinned
not
spared
but
in chains
of gloomy darkness
having cast [them] down to Tartarus
delivered [them]
for
judgment
being kept
and
[the] ancient
world
not
He spared
but
one of eight
Noah
of righteousness
a herald
preserved
[the] flood upon
[the] world
of [the] ungodly
having brought in
and
[the] cities
of Sodom
and
Gomorrah
having reduced to ashes
to destruction
He condemned [them]
an example
of what is coming on
the ungodly
having set
and
righteous
Lot
being distressed
by
the
of the
lawless
in
sensuality
conduct
He rescued
through seeing
for
and
hearing
that
righteous [man]
dwelling
among
them
day
after
day
in [his] soul
righteous
with [their] lawless
deeds
was tormented
[then] knows
[the] Lord
[the] devout
out of
temptation
to deliver
[the] unrighteous
then
unto
[the] day
of judgment
being punished
to keep
especially
then
those
after
[the] flesh
in
[the] passion
of defilement
walking
and
authority
despising
Bold
self-willed
glorious ones
not
they tremble
blaspheming
whereas
angels
in strength
and
power
greater
being
not
do bring
against
them
before
[the] Lord
a reviling
judgment
These
however
like
irrational
animals
having been born
as creatures of instinct
for
capture
and
destruction
in
what
they are ignorant of
blaspheming
in
the
destruction
of them
also
will be destroyed
suffering wrong
[as the] wage
of unrighteousness
[as] pleasure
esteeming
-
in
daytime
carousal
blots
and
blemishes
reveling
in
the
deceptions
of them
feasting with
you
eyes
having
full
of adultery
and
unceasing
from sin
enticing
souls
unestablished
a heart
having been exercised
in craving
having
of a curse
children
Having left
[the] straight
way
they have gone astray
having followed
in the
way
-
of Balaam
-
[son] of Bosor
who
[the] wage
of unrighteousness
loved
reproof
however
he had
for his own
transgression
[by] a donkey
mute
in
a manâs
voice
having spoken
it restrained
the
of the
prophet
madness
These
are
springs
without water
and
mists
by
storm
being driven
for whom
-
gloom
-
of darkness
has been reserved
Arrogant
for
of vanity
speaking words
they entice
with
[the] passions
of [the] flesh
to sensuality
those
barely
escaping
from those
in
error
living
freedom
them
promising
themselves
slaves
being
-
of corruption
By what
for
anyone
has been subdued
by that
he is enslaved
If
for
having escaped
the
pollutions
of the
world
through
[the] knowledge
of the
Lord
and
Savior
Jesus
Christ
in these
now
again
having been entangled
they are subdued
has become
to them
the
last [state]
worse
than the
first
Better
for
it would have been
for them
not
to have known
the
way
-
of righteousness
than
having known [it]
to have turned
from
the
having been delivered
to them
holy
commandment
Has happened
to them
the thing
of the
true
proverb
A dog
having returned
to
[its]
own
vomit
and
A sow
having washed
to [her]
rolling place
in [the] mire
This
now
beloved
[is the] second
to you
I am writing
letter
in
which
I am stirring up
of you
in
putting [you] in remembrance
-
pure
mind
to remember
the
having been spoken beforehand
words
by
the
holy
prophets
and
of the
-
apostles
through your
commandment
of the
Lord
and
Savior
this
first
knowing
that
will come
in
[the] last
of the
days
with
scoffing
scoffers
according to
-
own
evil desires
of them
following
and
saying
Where
is
the
promise
of the
coming
of Him
From
[the time] that
for
the
fathers
fell asleep
all things
as they were
continue
from
[the] beginning
of creation
It is concealed from
indeed
them
this
willingly
that
heavens
existed
long ago
and
[the] earth
out of
water
and
through
water
having been composed
by the
-
of God
word
through
which
the
at that time
world
with water
having been deluged
perished
-
But
now
the heavens
and
the
earth
by the
same
word
having been stored up
exist
for fire
being kept
unto
[the] day
of judgment
and
destruction
-
of ungodly
men
[This] one
however
thing
not
let be hidden from
you
beloved
that
one
day
with [the]
Lord [is]
like
a thousand
years
and
a thousand
years
like
day
one
Not
does delay
the Lord
the
promise
as
some
slowness
esteem
but
is patient
toward
you
not
willing
[for] any
to perish
but
all
to
repentance
to come
Will come
however
[the] day
of [the] Lord
like
a thief
in
which
the
heavens
with a roar
will pass away
elements
then
burning with heat
will be dissolved
and
[the] earth
and
the
in
it
works
will be found
These things
in this way
all
being dissolved
what kind
ought
to be
you
In
holy
conduct
and
godliness
expecting
and
hastening
the
coming
of the
-
of God
day
by reason of
which
[the] heavens
being set on fire
will be dissolved
and
[the] elements
burning with heat
are melting
New
however
heavens
and
earth
a new
according to
the
promise
of Him
we are awaiting
in
which
righteousness
dwells
Therefore
beloved
these things
expecting
be diligent
without spot
and
without blemish
by Him
to be found
in
peace
And
the
of the
Lord
of us
patience
[as] salvation
esteem
just as
also
-
beloved
of us
brother
Paul
according to
the
having been given
to him
wisdom
wrote
to you
as
also
in
all
letters
speaking
in
them
concerning
these things
among
which
are
difficult to be understood
some things
which
the
ignorant
and
unestablished
distort
as
also
the
other
Scriptures
to
the
own
of them
destruction
You
therefore
beloved
knowing [this] beforehand
beware
that
not
by the
of the
lawless
error
having been led away
you should fall from
the
own
steadfastness
Grow
however
in
grace
and
in knowledge
of the
Lord
of us
and
Savior
Jesus
Christ
To Him [be]
the
glory
both
now
and
to
[the] day
of eternity
That which
was
from
[the] beginning
that which
we have heard
that which
we have seen
with the
eyes
of us
that which
we have gazed upon
and
the
hands
of us
have handled
concerning
the
Word
-
of life
and
the
life
was made manifest
and
we have seen
and
bear witness
and
we proclaim
to you
the
life
-
eternal
which
was
with
the
Father
and
was revealed
to us
that which
we have seen
and
have heard
we proclaim
also
to you
so that
also
you
fellowship
may have
with
us
Indeed
the
fellowship
now
-
of us
[is] with
the
Father
and
with
the
Son
of Him
Jesus
Christ
And
these things
write
we
so that
the
joy
of us
might be
complete
And
is
this
the
message
that
we have heard
from
Him
and
we preach
to you
that
-
God
light
is
and
darkness
in
Him
not
is
none
If
we should say
that
fellowship
we have
with
Him
and yet
in
the
darkness
should walk
we lie
and
not
do practice
the
truth
If
however
in
the
light
we should walk
as
He
is
in
the
light
fellowship
we have
with
one another
and
the
blood
of Jesus
the
Son
of Him
cleanses
us
from
all
sin
If
we should say
that
sin
not
we have
ourselves
we deceive
and
the
truth
not
is
in
us
If
we should confess
the
sins
of us
faithful
He is
and
just
that
He may forgive
us
[our]
sins
and
might cleanse
us
from
all
unrighteousness
If
we should say
that
not
we have sinned
a liar
we make
Him
and
the
word
of Him
not
is
in
us
Little children
of me
these things
I am writing
to you
so that
not
you might sin
And
if
anyone
should sin
an advocate
we have
with
the
Father
Jesus
Christ
[the] Righteous [One]
And
He
[the] propitiation
is
for
the
sins
of us
not
for
the
of ours
and
only
but
also
for
all
the
world
And
by
this
we know
that
we have come to know
Him
if
the
commandments
of Him
we should keep
The [one]
saying
-
I have known
Him
and
the
commandments
of Him
not
keeping
a liar
he is
and
in
him
the
truth
not
is
Whoever
however
-
may keep
His
-
word
truly
in
him
the
love
-
of God
has been perfected
By
this
we know
that
in
Him
we are
The [one]
claiming
in
Him
to abide
ought
just as
that
walk
also
He
in the same way
walked
Beloved
not
a commandment
new
I am writing
to you
but
a commandment
old
which
you have had
from
[the] beginning
The
commandment
-
old
is
the
word
that
you have heard
Again
a commandment
new
I am writing
to you
which
is
true
in
Him
and
in
you
because
the
darkness
is passing away
and
the
light
-
true
already
shines
The [one]
claiming
in
the
light
to be
and
the
brother
of him
hating
in
the
darkness
is
even until
now
The [one]
loving
the
brother
of him
in
the
light
abides
and
cause for stumbling
in
him
not
there is
The [one]
however
hating
the
brother
of him
in
the
darkness
is
and
in
the
darkness
walks
and
not
does he know
where
he is going
because
the
darkness
has blinded
the
eyes
of him
I am writing
to you
little children
because
have been forgiven
your
-
sins
for the sake of
the
name
of Him
I am writing
to you
fathers
because
you have known
Him who [is]
from
[the] beginning
I am writing
to you
young men
because
you have overcome
the
evil [one]
I have written
to you
little children
because
you know
the
Father
I have written
to you
fathers
because
you know
Him who [is]
from
[the] beginning
I have written
to you
young men
because
strong
you are
and
the
word
-
of God
in
you
abides
and
you have overcome
the
evil [one]
Not
love
the
world
nor
the things
in
the
world
If
anyone
should love
the
world
not
is
the
love
of the
Father
in
him
because
all
that [is]
in
the
world
the
desire
of the
flesh
and
the
desire
of the
eyes
and
the
vaunting
of
life
not
is
from
the
Father
but
from
the
world
is
And
the
world
is passing away
and
the
desire
of it
the [one]
however
doing
the
will
-
of God
abides
to
the
age
Little children
[the] last
hour
it is
and
as
you have heard
that
antichrist
is coming
even
now
antichrists
many
have arisen
whereby
we know
that
[the] last
hour
it is
From among
us
they went out
but
not
they were
of
us
if
for
of
us
they had been
they would have remained
-
with
us
But
[it is] so that
it might be made manifest
that
not
they are
all
of
us
And
you
[the] anointing
have
from
the
Holy [One]
and
know you
all
Not
I have written
to you
because
not
you know
the
truth
but
because
you know
it
and
because
any
lie
of
the
truth
not
is
Who
is
the
liar
if
not
the [one]
denying
that
Jesus
not
is
the
Christ
This
is
the
antichrist
the [one]
denying
the
Father
and
the
Son
Everyone
-
denying
the
Son
neither
the
Father
has he
The [one]
confessing
the
Son
also
the
Father
has
You
what
you have heard
from
[the] beginning
in
you
let it abide
If
in
you
should abide
what
from
[the] beginning
you have heard
also
you
in
the
Son
and
in
the
Father
will abide
And
this
is
the
promise
that
He
promised
us
-
life
-
eternal
These things
I have written
to you
concerning
those
leading astray
you
And
you
the
anointing
that
you received
from
Him
abides
in
you
and
not
need
you have
that
anyone
should teach
you
But
just as
the
same
anointing
teaches
you
concerning
all things
and
true
is
and
not
is
a lie
and
just as
it has taught
you
you shall abide
in
Him
And
now
little children
abide
in
Him
so that
when
He appears
we might have
boldness
and
not
be ashamed
before
Him
at
the
coming
of Him
If
you know
that
righteous
He is
you know
that
also
everyone
-
practicing
-
righteousness
of
Him
has been begotten
Behold
what
love
has given
to us
the
Father
that
children
of God
we should be called
and
we are
Because of
this
the
world
not
knows
us
because
not
it knew
Him
Beloved
now
children
of God
are we
and
not yet
has been revealed
what
we will be
We know
that
when
He appears
like
Him
we will be
for
we will see
Him
as
He is
And
everyone
-
having
the
hope
this
in
Him
purifies
himself
just as
He
pure
is
Everyone
-
committing
-
sin
also
-
lawlessness
commits
and
-
sin
is
-
lawlessness
And
you know
that
He
appeared
so that
-
sins
He might take away
and
sin
in
Him
not
there is
Anyone
-
in
Him
abiding
not
sins
anyone
-
sinning
not
has seen
Him
nor
has he known
Him
Little children
no one
let lead astray
you
the [one]
practicing
-
righteousness
righteous
is
just as
He
righteous
is
The [one]
practicing
-
sin
of
the
devil
is
because
from
[the] beginning
the
devil
has been sinning
For
this [reason]
was revealed
the
Son
-
of God
so that
He might destroy
the
works
of the
devil
Anyone
-
having been born
of
-
God
sin
not
practices
because
seed
of Him
in
him
abides
and
not
he is able
to continue sinning
because
of
-
God
he has been born
Through
this
manifest
are
the
children
-
of God
and
the
children
of the
devil
Anyone
-
not
practicing
righteousness
not
is
of
-
God
and also
the [one]
not
loving
the
brother
of him
For
this
is
the
message
that
you have heard
from
[the] beginning
that
we should love
one another
not
as
Cain
[who] of
the
evil [one]
was
and
slew
the
brother
of him
And
because of
what
he slayed
him
Because
the
works
of him
evil
were
those
however
of the
brother
of him
righteous
not
be surprised
brothers
if
hates
you
the
world
We
know
that
we have passed
from
-
death
to
-
life
because
we love
[our]
brothers
The [one]
not
loving
abides
in
-
death
Everyone
-
hating
the
brother
of him
a murderer
is
and
you know
that
any
murderer
not
has
life
eternal
in
him
abiding
By
this
we have known
-
love
because
He
for
us
the
life
of Him
laid down
and
we
ought
for
[our]
brothers
[our]
lives
to lay down
Whoever
now
-
might have
the
goods
of the
world
and
might see
the
brother
of him
need
having
and
might close up
the
heart
of him
from
him
how
the
love
-
of God
abides
in
him
Little children
not
we should love
in word
nor
in
tongue
but
in
action
and
in truth
by
this
we will know
that
of
the
truth
we are
and
before
Him
we will assure
the
heart
of us
that
if
should condemn [us]
our
-
heart
that
greater than
is
-
God
the
heart
of us
and
He knows
all things
Beloved
if
the
heart
not
should condemn [us]
confidence
we have
toward
-
God
and
whatever
if
we might ask
we receive
from
Him
because
the
commandments
of Him
we keep
and
the things
pleasing
before
Him
we do
And
this
is
the
commandment
of Him
that
we should believe
in the
name
the
Son
of Him
Jesus
Christ
and
we should love
one another
just as
He gave
[the] commandment
to us
And
the [one]
keeping
the
commandments
of Him
in
Him
abides
and
He
in
him
And
by
this
we know
that
He abides
in
us
by
the
Spirit
whom
to us
He has given
Beloved
not
every
spirit
believe
but
test
the
spirits
whether
of
-
God
they are
because
many
false prophets
have gone out
into
the
world
By
this
you know
the
Spirit
-
of God
Every
spirit
that
confesses
Jesus
Christ
in
[the] flesh
having come
of
-
God
is
and
any
spirit
that
not
confesses
-
Jesus
from
-
God
not
is
And
this
is
that
of the
antichrist
which
you heard
that
is coming
and
now
in
the
world
is
already
You
from
-
God
are
little children
and
have overcome
them
because
greater
is
the [One]
in
you
than
the [one]
in
the
world
They
of
the
world
are
because of
this
from out
of the
world
they speak
and
the
world
them
listens to
We
of
-
God
are
The [one]
knowing
-
God
listens to
us
He who
not
is
from
-
God
not
listens to
us
By
this
we know
the
Spirit
-
of truth
and
the
spirit
-
of falsehood
Beloved
we should love
one another
because
-
love
from
-
God
is
and
everyone
-
loving
from
-
God
has been born
and
knows
-
God
The [one]
not
loving
not
has known
-
God
because
-
God
love
is
In
this
has been revealed
the
love
-
of God
among
us
that
the
Son
of Him
the
one and only
has sent
-
God
into
the
world
so that
we might live
through
Him
In
this
is
-
love
not
that
we
loved
-
God
but
that
He
loved
us
and
sent
the
Son
of Him
[as] a propitiation
for
the
sins
of us
Beloved
if
so
-
God
loved
us
also
we
ought
one another
to love
God
no one
at any time
has seen
if
we should love
one another
-
God
in
us
abides
and
the
love
of Him
having been perfected
in
us
is
By
this
we know
that
in
Him
we abide
and
He
in
us
because
from out
the
Spirit
of Him
He has given
to us
And
we
have seen
and
testify
that
the
Father
has sent
the
Son [as]
Savior
of the
world
Whoever
if
shall confess
that
Jesus
is
the
Son
-
of God
-
God
in
him
abides
and
he
in
-
God
And
we
have come to know
and
have come to believe
the
love
that
has
-
God
as to
us
-
God
love
is
and
the [one]
abiding
in
-
love
in
-
God
abides
and
-
God
in
him
abides
In
this
has been perfected
-
love
with
us
so that
confidence
we may have
in
the
day
-
of judgment
that
just as
He
is
also
we
are
in
the
world
this
Fear
no
there is
in
-
love
but
-
perfect
love
out
casts
-
fear
because
the
fear
punishment
has
the [one]
now
fearing
not
has been perfected
in
-
love
We
love
because
He
first
loved
us
If
anyone
should say
-
I love
-
God
and
the
brother
of him
should hate
a liar
he is
The [one]
for
not
loving
the
brother
of him
whom
he has seen
-
God
whom
not
he has seen
not
is he able
to love
And
this
the
commandment
we have
from
Him
that
the [one]
loving
-
God
should love
also
the
brother
of him
Everyone
-
believing
that
Jesus
is
the
Christ
of
-
God
has been born
and
everyone
-
loving
the [One]
having begotten [Him]
loves
the [one]
having been begotten
from
Him
By
this
we know
that
we love
the
children
-
of God
when
-
God
we love
and
the
commandments
of Him
keep
This
for
is
the
love
-
of God
that
the
commandments
of Him
we should keep
and
the
commandments
of Him
burdensome
not
are
For
everyone
-
having been born
of
-
God
overcomes
the
world
and
this
is
the
victory
-
having overcome
the
world
the
faith
of us
Who
is
the [one]
overcoming
the
world
if
not
the [one]
believing
that
Jesus
is
the
Son
-
of God
This
is
the [One]
having come
by
water
and
blood
Jesus
Christ
not
by
-
water
only
but
by
-
water
and
by
-
blood
And
the
Spirit
is
the [One]
testifying
because
the
Spirit
is
the
truth
For
three
there are
-
bearing testimony
the
Spirit
and
the
water
and
the
blood
and
these
three
in
-
one
are
If
the
testimony
-
of men
we receive
the
testimony
-
of God
greater
is
For
this
is
the
testimony
-
of God
that
He has testified
concerning
the
Son
of Him
The [one]
believing
in
the
Son
-
of God
has
the
testimony
in
himself
The [one]
not
believing
-
God
a liar
has made
Him
because
not
he has believed
in
the
testimony
that
has testified
-
God
concerning
the
Son
Him
And
this
is
the
testimony
that
life
eternal
has given
-
God
to us
and
this
the
life
in
the
Son
His
is
The [one]
having
the
Son
has
-
life
the [one]
not
having
the
Son
-
of God
-
life
not
has
These things
have I written
to you
so that
you may know
that
life
you have
eternal
to those
believing
in
the
name
of the
Son
-
of God
And
this
is
the
confidence
that
we have
toward
Him
that
if
anything
we might ask
according to
the
will
of Him
He hears
us
And
if
we know
that
He hears
us
whatever
if
we might ask
we know
that
we have
the
requests
that
we have asked
from
Him
If
anyone
should see
the
brother
of him
sinning
a sin
not
unto
death
he shall ask
and
He will give
him
life
to those
sinning
not
unto
death
There is
a sin
unto
death
not
concerning
that
do I say
that
he should implore
All
unrighteousness
sin
is
and
there is
sin
not
unto
death
We know
that
everyone
-
having been born
of
-
God
not
continues to sin
but
the [One]
having been begotten
of
-
God
protects
him
and
the
evil [one]
not
does touch
him
We know
that
of
-
God
we are
and
the
world
whole
in
the
evil [one]
lies
We know
now
that
the
Son
-
of God
is come
and
has given
us
understanding
so that
we may know
Him who [is]
true
and
we are
in
Him who [is]
true
in
the
Son
of Him
Jesus
Christ
He
is
the
true
God
and
life
eternal

I rejoiced
exceedingly
that
I have found
[some] of
the
children
of you
walking
in

just as
commandment
we received
from
the
Father
And
now
I implore
you
lady
not
as
a commandment
I am writing
to you
new
but
that which
we have had
from
[the] beginning
that
we should love
one another
And
this
is
-
love
that
we should walk
according to
the
commandments
of Him
This
the
commandment
is
just as
you have heard
from
[the] beginning
so that
in
it
you should walk
For
many
deceivers
have entered
into
the
world
those
not
confessing
Jesus
Christ
coming
in
flesh
This
is
the
deceiver

we have worked for

On behalf
for
of the

We
therefore
ought

such [men]
so that
fellow workers
we may be

I have written
something
to the
church
but
the [one]

Diotrephes
not

Because of
this
if
I might come
I will bring to remembrance
of him
the
works
which
he is doing
with words
evil
prating against
us
and
not
being satisfied
with
these
neither
himself
he receives
the

those

from

whatever things

not
they have seen
they speak evil of
whatever things
then
naturally
as
the
irrational
animals
they understand
in
these things
they corrupt themselves
Woe
to them
because
in the
way
-
of Cain
they went
and
to the
error
-
of Balaam
for reward
they rushed
and
in the
rebellion
-
of Korah
they perished
These
are
the ones
in
the
love feasts
of you
hidden reefs
feasting together [with you]
fearlessly
themselves
shepherding
clouds
without water
by
winds
being carried about

shame

the

amidst
holy [ones]
myriads
of His
to execute
judgment
against
all
and
to convict
all
the
ungodly
concerning
all
the
works
of ungodliness
of them
which
they have done in an ungodly way
and
concerning
all
the
harsh [things]
that
have spoken
against
Him

ungodly
These
are
grumblers
discontented
after
the
lusts
own
following
and
the
mouth
of them
speaks
great swelling [words]
flattering
faces

You

the
words

having been spoken beforehand
by

of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
that
they were saying
to you
In
[the] last

time
there will be
scoffers
after

their own
passions
following

of ungodlinesses
These
are
those
causing divisions
worldly-minded

And
those who
indeed
have mercy on
are doubting

out of

the
brother
of you
and
fellow-partaker
in
the
tribulation
and
kingdom
and
endurance
in
Jesus
was
in
the
island
-
called
Patmos
on account of
the
word
-
of God
and
the
testimony
of Jesus
I was
in
[the] Spirit
on
the
Lordâs
day
and
I heard
behind
me
a voice
loud
like that
of a trumpet
saying
What
you see
write
in
a book
and
send
to the
seven
churches
to
Ephesus
and
to
Smyrna
and
to
Pergamum
and
to
Thyatira
and
to
Sardis
and
to
Philadelphia
and
to
Laodicea
And
I turned
to see
the
voice
that
was speaking
with
me
And
having turned
I saw
seven
lampstands
golden
and
in
[the] midst
of the
lampstands
[One] like
[the] Son
of Man
having been clothed
to the feet
and
having been girded about
at
the
breasts
with a sash
golden
-
And
the head
of Him
and
the
hairs
[are] white
as if
wool
white
as
snow
and
the
eyes
of Him
[are] like
a flame
of fire
and
the
feet
of Him
[are] like
fine bronze
as
in
a furnace
having been refined
and
the
voice
of Him
[is] like
[the] voice
of waters
many
and
He is holding
in
the
right
hand
of Him
stars
seven
and
out of
the
mouth
of Him
a sword
two-edged
sharp
is going forth
and
the
face
of Him
[is] like
the
sun
shining
in
the
full strength
of it
And
when
I saw
Him
I fell
at
the
feet
of Him
as though
dead
And
He placed
the
right hand
of Him
upon
me
saying
Not
fear
I
am
the
First
and
the
Last
and
the
Living [One]
and
I was
dead
and
behold
living
I am
to
the
ages
of the
ages
and
I have
the
keys
of
Death
and
of
Hades

therefore
the things that
you have seen
and
the things that
are

the things that
are about
to take place
after
these

endurance

them
false
And
perseverance
you have

I have

works
do

however
not
I am coming
to you

I will remove
the
lampstand
of you
out of
the
place
of it
if
not
you should repent

I also
hate

of you
so that
you may see
I
as many as
if
might love
I rebuke
and
discipline
be zealous
therefore
and
repent
Behold
I stand
at
the
door
and
knock
If
anyone
should hear
the
voice
of Me
and
open
the
door
I will come in
to
him
and
will dine
with
him
and
he
with
Me
The [one]
overcoming
I will give
to him
to sit
with
Me
on
the
throne
of Me
as
I also
overcame
and
sat down
with
the
Father
of Me
on
the
throne
of Him
The [one]
having
an ear
let him hear
what
the
Spirit
says
to the
churches
After
these things
I looked
and
behold
a door
was standing open
in
-
heaven
and
the
voice
-
first
that
I heard
like
a trumpet
was speaking
with
me
saying
Come up
here
and
I will show
to you
what
it behooves
to take place
after
these things
Immediately
I was
in
[the] Spirit
and
behold
a throne
was set
in
-
heaven
and
upon
the
throne
[One] sitting
and
the [One]
sitting
[was] like
in appearance
stone
jasper
and
sardius
And
a rainbow
[was] around
the
throne
like
in appearance
an emerald
And
around
the
throne
thrones
[were] twenty
four
and
on
the
thrones
twenty
four
elders
sitting
having been clothed
in
garments
white
and
on
the
heads
of them
crowns
golden
And
out of
the
throne
come
flashes of lightning
and
voices
and
thunderings
And
[there were] seven
lamps
of fire
burning
before
the
throne
which
are
the
seven
Spirits
-
of God
And
before
the
throne
[was something] like
a sea
of glass
like
crystal
And
in
[the] midst
of the
throne
and
around
the
throne
[were] four
living creatures
being full
of eyes
in front
and
behind
And
the
living creature
-
first
[was] like
a lion
and
the
second
living creature
like
a calf
and
the
third
living creature
having
the
face
as
of a man
and
the
fourth
living creature
like
an eagle
flying
And
the
four
living creatures
one
for
one
of them
had
respectively
wings
six
all around
and
within
full
of eyes
and
rest
not
they have
day
and
night
saying
Holy
Holy
Holy
Lord
-
God
-
Almighty
the [One]
having been
and
the [One]
being
and
the [One]
coming
And
whenever
will give
the
living creatures
glory
and
honor
and
thanksgiving
to the [One]
sitting
upon
the
throne
the [One]
living
to
the
ages
of the
ages
will fall
the
twenty
four
elders
before
the [One]
sitting
upon
the
throne
and
they will worship
the [One]
living
to
the
ages
of the
ages
and
they will cast
the
crowns
of them
before
the
throne
saying
Worthy
are You
the
Lord
and
-
God
of us
to receive
-
glory
and
-
honor
and
-
power
for
You
created
-
all things
and
because of
the
will
of You
they existed
and
were created
And
I saw
on
the
right hand
of the [One]
sitting
upon
the
throne
a scroll
having been written
inside
and
on [the] back
having been sealed
with seals
seven
And
I saw
an angel
strong
proclaiming
in
a voice
loud
Who is
worthy
to open
the
scroll
and
to break
the
seals
of it
And
no one
was able
in
-
heaven
nor
upon
the
earth
nor
under
the
earth
to open
the
scroll
nor
to see
it
And
was weeping
loudly
because
no one
worthy
was found
to open
the
scroll
nor
to see
it
And
one
of
the
elders
says
to me
Not
do weep
Behold
has overcome
the
Lion
-
of
the
tribe
of Judah
the
root
of David
to open
the
scroll
and
the
seven
seals
of it
And
I saw
in
[the] midst
of the
throne
and
of the
four
living creatures
and
in
[the] midst
of the
elders
a Lamb
standing
as
having been slain
having
horns
seven
and
eyes
seven
which
are
the
seven
Spirits
-
of God
having been sent out
into
all
the
earth
And
He came
and
took [it]
out of
the
right hand
of the [One]
sitting
on
the
throne
And
when
He had taken
the
scroll
the
four
living creatures
and
the
twenty
four
elders
fell down
before
the
Lamb
having
each
a harp
and
bowls
golden
being full
of incenses
which
are
the
prayers
of the
saints
And
they are singing
a song
new
saying
Worthy
are You
to take
the
scroll
and
to open
the
seals
of it
because
You were slain
and
You purchased
-
to God
by
the
blood
of You
out of
every
tribe
and
tongue
and
people
and
nation
and
You have made
them
to the
God
of us
a kingdom
and
priests
and
they will reign
upon
the
earth
And
I looked
and
I heard
[the] voice
of angels
many
around
the
throne
and
of the
living creatures
and
of the
elders
and
was
the
number
of them
myriads
of myriads
and
thousands
of thousands
saying
in a voice
loud
Worthy
is
the
Lamb
-
having been slain
to receive
the
power
and
riches
and
wisdom
and
strength
and
honor
and
glory
and
blessing
And
every
creature
which
in
-
heaven
and
upon
the
earth
and
under
the
earth
and
on
the
sea
is
and
-
in
them
everything
I heard
saying
To the [One]
sitting
on
the
throne
and
to the
Lamb
-
blessing
and
-
honor
and
-
glory
and
-
might
to
the
ages
of the
ages
And
the
four
living creatures
kept saying
Amen
And
the
elders
fell down
and
worshiped
And
I watched
when
opened
the
Lamb
one
of
the
seven
seals
and
I heard
one
of
the
four
living creatures
saying
like
a voice
of thunder
Come
And
I looked
and
behold
a horse
white
and
the [one]
sitting
on
it
having
a bow
and
was given
to him
a crown
and
he went forth
overcoming
and
that
he might conquer
And
when
He opened
the
seal
-
second
I heard
the
second
living creature
saying
Come
And
went forth
another
horse
bright red
and
to the [one]
sitting
on
it
was granted
to him
to take
the
peace
from
the
earth
and
that
one another
they will slay
and
was given
to him
a sword
great
And
when
He opened
the
seal
-
third
I heard
the
third
living creature
saying
Come
And
I looked
and
behold
a horse
black
and
the [one]
sitting
on
it
having
a pair of scales
in
the
hand
of him
And
I heard
[something] like
a voice
in
[the] midst
of the
four
living creatures
saying
A choenix
of wheat
for a denarius
and
three
choenixes
of barley
for a denarius
and
the
oil
and
the
wine
not
you should injure
And
when
He opened
the
seal
-
fourth
I heard
[the] voice
of the
fourth
living creature
saying
Come
And
I looked
and
behold
a horse
pale
and
the [one]
sitting
on
it
[the] name
of him [was]
-
Death
and
-
Hades
was following
with
him
and
was given
to them
authority
over
the
fourth
of the
earth
to kill
with
sword
and
with
famine
and
with
plague
and
by
the
beasts
of the
earth
And
when
He opened
the
fifth
seal
I saw
under
the
altar
the
souls
of those
having been slain
because of
the
word
-
of God
and
because of
the
testimony
which
they had upheld
And
they were crying
in a voice
loud
saying
Until
when
O
Lord
-
holy
and
true
not
do You judge
and
avenge
the
blood
of us
from
those
dwelling
upon
the
earth
And
were given
to them
each
robes
white
and
it was said
to them
that
they shall rest
yet
a time
little
until
would be fulfilled
also
the
fellow servants
of them
and
the
brothers
of them
those
being about
to be killed
as
also [had been]
they
And
I saw
when
He opened
the
seal
-
sixth
and
an earthquake
great
there was
and
the
sun
became
black
as
sackcloth
of hair
and
the
moon
whole
became
like
blood
and
the
stars
of
heaven
fell
to
the
earth
as
a fig tree
casts
the
unripe figs
of it
by
a wind
great
being shaken
And
-
heaven
departed
like
a scroll
being rolled up
and
every
mountain
and
island
out of
the
places
of them
were moved
And
the
kings
of the
earth
and
the
great ones
and
the
commanders
and
the
rich
and
the
powerful
and
every
slave
and
free
hid
themselves
in
the
caves
and
among
the
rocks
of the
mountains
And
they say
to the
mountains
and
to the
rocks
Fall
on
us
and
hide
us
from
[the] face
of the [One]
sitting
on
the
throne
and
from
the
wrath
of the
Lamb
because
has come
the
day
-
great
of the
wrath
of Them
and
who
is able
to stand
After
these things
I saw
four
angels
standing
upon
the
four
corners
of the
earth
holding
the
four
winds
of the
earth
so that
no
would blow
wind
on
the
earth
nor
on
the
sea
nor
on
any
tree
And
I saw
another
angel
having ascended
from
[the] rising
of [the] sun
having
[the] seal
of God
[the] living
And
he cried
in a voice
loud
to the
four
angels
to whom
it had been given
to them
to harm
the
earth
and
the
sea
saying
Not
harm
the
earth
nor
the
sea
nor
the
trees
until
we shall have sealed
the
servants
of the
God
of us
on
the
foreheads
of them
And
I heard
the
number
of those
having been sealed
one hundred
forty
four
thousand
having been sealed
out of
every
tribe
of [the] sons
of Israel
Out of
[the] tribe
of Judah
twelve
thousand
having been sealed
out of
[the] tribe
of Reuben
twelve
thousand
out of
[the] tribe
of Gad
twelve
thousand
out of
[the] tribe
of Asher
twelve
thousand
out of
[the] tribe
of Naphtali
twelve
thousand
out of
[the] tribe
of Manasseh
twelve
thousand
out of
[the] tribe
of Simeon
twelve
thousand
out of
[the] tribe
of Levi
twelve
thousand
out of
[the] tribe
of Isaachar
twelve
thousand
out of
[the] tribe
of Zebulun
twelve
thousand
out of
[the] tribe
of Joseph
twelve
thousand
out of
[the] tribe
of Benjamin
twelve
thousand
having been sealed
After
these things
I looked
and
behold
a multitude
great
which
to number
it
no one
was able
out of
every
nation
and
tribes
and
peoples
and
tongues
standing
before
the
throne
and
before
the
Lamb
having been clothed with
robes
white
and
palm branches
in
the
hands
of them
And
they were crying out
in a voice
loud
saying
-
Salvation
to the
God
of us
the [One]
sitting
on
the
throne
and
to the
Lamb
And
all
the
angels
stood
around
the
throne
and
the
elders
and
the
four
living creatures
and
they fell
before
the
throne
upon
the
faces
of them
and
worshiped
-
God
saying
Amen
-
Blessing
and
-
glory
and
-
wisdom
and
-
thanksgiving
and
-
honor
and
-
power
and
-
strength
to the
God
of us
to
the
ages
of the
ages
Amen
And
answered
one
of
the
elders
saying
to me
These
-
having been clothed with
the
robes
-
white
who
are they
and
from where
have they come
And
I said
to him
Lord
of me
you
know
And
he said
to me
These
are
the [ones]
coming
out of
the
tribulation
-
great
and
they have washed
the
robes
of them
and
made white
them
in
the
blood
of the
Lamb
Because of
this
They are
before
the
throne
-
of God
and
serve
Him
day
and
night
in
the
temple
of Him
and
the [One]
sitting
on
the
throne
will tabernacle
over
them
Not
they will hunger
any more
neither
will they thirst
anymore
nor
at all
shall fall
upon
them
the
sun
nor
any
scorching heat
because
the
Lamb
-
in the
center
of the
throne
will shepherd
them
and
He will lead
them
to
living
fountains
of waters
and
will wipe away
-
God
every
tear
from
the
eyes
of them
And
when
He opened
the
seal
-
seventh
there was
silence
in
-
heaven
for about
half an hour
And
I saw
the
seven
angels
who
before
-
God
stand
and
were given
to them
seven
trumpets
And
another
angel
came
and
stood
at
the
altar
having
a censer
golden
and
was given
to him
incense
much
that
he will offer [it]
with the
prayers
of the
saints
all
upon
the
altar
-
golden
-
before
the
throne
And
went up
the
smoke
of the
incense
with the
prayers
of the
saints
out of
[the] hand
of the
angel
before
-
God
And
took
the
angel
the
censer
and
filled
it
from
the
fire
of the
altar
and
cast [it]
to
the
earth
and
there were
thunders
and
rumblings
and
flashes of lightning
and
an earthquake
And
the
seven
angels
-
having
the
seven
trumpets
prepared
themselves
that
they might sound the trumpets
And
the
first
sounded [his] trumpet
and
there was
hail
and
fire
having been mixed
with
blood
and
it was cast
upon
the
earth
And
a
third
of
the earth
was burned up
and
a
third
of the
trees
were burned up
and
all
[the] grass
green
was burned up
And
the
second
angel
sounded [his] trumpet
and
[something] like
a mountain
great
with fire
burning
was cast
into
the
sea
And
became
a
third
of the
sea
blood
and
died
a
third
of the
creatures
-
in
the
sea
-
having
life
and
a
third
of the
ships
were destroyed
And
the
third
angel
sounded [his] trumpet
and
fell
out of
-
heaven
a star
great
burning
like
a torch
And
it fell
upon
a
third
of the
rivers
and
upon
the
springs
of
waters
And
the
name
the
star
is called
-
Wormwood
And
became
a
third
of the
waters
into
wormwood
and
many
of the
men
died
from
the
waters
because
they were made bitter
And
the
fourth
angel
sounded [his] trumpet
and
was struck
a
third
of the
sun
and
a
third
of the
moon
and
a
third
of the
stars
so that
should be darkened
a
third
of them
and
the
day
not
should appear [for]
a
third
of it
and
the
night
likewise
And
I looked
and
I heard
one
eagle
flying
in
mid-heaven
saying
in a voice
loud
Woe
Woe
Woe
to those
dwelling
on
the
earth
because of
the
remaining
voices
of the
trumpet
of the
three
angels
-
being about
to sound [their] trumpets
And
the
fifth
angel
sounded [his] trumpet
and
I saw
a star
out of
-
heaven
having fallen
to
the
earth
and
was given
to it
the
key
of the
pit
of the
abyss
And
he opened
the
pit
of the
abyss
and
went up
smoke
out of
the
pit
like
[the] smoke
of a furnace
great
and
were darkened
the
sun
and
the
air
by
the
smoke
of the
pit
And
out of
the
smoke
came forth
locusts
unto
the
earth
and
was given
to them
power
like
have
power
the
scorpions
of the
earth
And
it was said
to them
that
not
they shall harm
the
grass
of the
earth
nor
any
green thing
nor
any
tree
if
not
the
men
-
not
having
the
seal
-
of God
on
the
foreheads
And
it was granted
to them
that
not
they should kill
them
but
that
they shall torment [them]
months
five
And
the
torment
of them
[was] like
torment
of a scorpion
when
it might strike
a man
And
in
the
days
those
will seek
-
men
-
death
and
not
no more
will find
it
and
they will long
to die
and
shall flee
-
death
from
them
And
the
appearance
of the
locusts [was]
like
horses
having been prepared
for
battle
and
upon
the
heads
of them
[were something] like
crowns
like
gold
and
the
faces
of them
like
[the] faces
of men
And
they had
hair
like
hair
of women
and
the
teeth
of them
like [those]
of lions
were
And
they had
breastplates
like
breastplates
of iron
and
the
sound
of the
wings
of them
[was] as
[the] sound
of chariots
of horses
many
rushing
into
battle
And
they have
tails
like
scorpions
and
stingers
and
in
the
tails
of them
[is] the
power
of them
to injure
-
men
for months
five
They have
over
them
a king
the
angel
of the
abyss
[The] name
of Him
in Hebrew
[is] Abaddon
and
in
the
Greek
[the] name
he has
Apollyon
-
Woe
the
first
has passed
Behold
are coming
still
two
woes
after
these things
And
the
sixth
angel
sounded [his] trumpet
and
I heard
voice
one
from
the
four
horns
of the
altar
-
golden
-
before
-
God
saying
to the
sixth
angel
the [one]
having
the
trumpet
Release
the
four
angels
those
having been bound
at
the
river
-
great
Euphrates
And
were released
the
four
angels
-
having been prepared
for
the
hour
and
day
and
month
and
year
so that
they might kill
a
third
-
of mankind
And
the
number
of the
armies
of the
cavalry [was]
twice ten thousand
ten thousands
I heard
the
number
of them
And
thus
I saw
the
horses
in
the
vision
and
those
sitting
on
them
having
breastplates
fiery
and
hyacinthine
and
brimstone
And
the
heads
of the
horses [were]
like
heads
of lions
and
out of
the
mouths
of them
proceed
fire
and
smoke
and
brimstone
By
-
three
plagues
these
was killed
a
third
of
mankind
by
the
fire
and
by the
smoke
and
by the
brimstone
-
proceeding
out of
the
mouths
of them
The
for
powers
of the
horses
in
the
mouths
of them
are
and
in
the
tails
of them
the
for
tails
of them
[are] like
serpents
having
heads
and
with
them
they injure


















































And
not
they repented
of
the
murders
of them
nor
of
the
sorceries
of them
nor
of
the
sexual immorality
of them
nor
of
the
thefts
of them
And
I saw
another
angel
mighty
coming down
out of
-
heaven
clothed with
a cloud
and
a
rainbow
upon
the
head
of him
and
the
face
of him
[was] like
the
sun
and
the
feet
of him
like
pillars
of fire
and
having
in
the
hand
of him
a little scroll
being open
And
he placed
the
foot
of him
-
right
upon
the
sea
the
and
left
upon
the
earth
And
he cried out
in a voice
loud
as
a lion
roars
And
when
he cried out
sounded
the
seven
thunders
the
of themselves
voice
And
when
had spoken
the
seven
thunders
I was about
to write
But
I heard
a voice
out of
-
heaven
saying
Seal
what
have spoken
the
seven
thunders
and
not
them
write
And
the
angel
whom
I saw
standing
on
the
sea
and
on
the
land
lifted up
the
hand
of him
the
right
to
-
heaven
and
he swore
by
the [One]
living
to
the
ages
of the
ages
who
created
-
heaven
and
the things
in
it
and
the
earth
and
the things
in
it
and
the
sea
and
the things
in
it
-
Delay
no longer
will there be
But
in
the
days
of the
voice
of the
seventh
angel
when
he is about
to sound [the] trumpet
then
would be completed
the
mystery
-
of God
as
proclaimed
the
of Himself
servants
the
prophets
And
the
voice
that
I heard
out of
-
heaven
again
was speaking
with
me
and
saying
Go
take
the
little scroll
-
having been opened
in
the
hand
of the
angel
-
standing
upon
the
sea
and
upon
the
land
And
I went
to
the
angel
saying
to him
Give
me
the
little scroll
And
he says
to me
Take
and
eat
it
and
it will make bitter
your
-
stomach
but
in
the
mouth
of you
it will be
sweet
as
honey
And
I took
the
little scroll
out of
the
hand
of the
angel
and
I ate
it
and
it was
in
the
mouth
of me
as
honey
sweet
and
when
I had eaten
it
was made bitter
the
stomach
of me
And
they say
to me
It is necessary
for you
again
to prophesy
concerning
peoples
and
nations
and
tongues
and
kings
many
And
was given
to me
a measuring rod
like
a staff
saying
Rise
and
measure
the
temple
-
of God
and
the
altar
and
those
worshiping
in
it
And
the
courtyard
-
outside
the
temple
leave
out
and
not
it
measure
because
it has been given [up]
to the
nations
and
the
city
-
holy
they will trample upon
months
forty
two
And
I will grant
to the
two
witnesses
of me
and
they will prophesy
days
a thousand
two hundred
sixty
clothed in
sackcloth
These
are
the
two
olive trees
and
the
two
lampstands
-
before
the
Lord
of the
earth
standing
And
if
anyone
them
should desire
to harm
fire
goes out
of
the
mouth
of them
and
devours
the
enemies
of them
And
if
anyone
should desire
them
to harm
thus
it is necessary
for him
to be killed
These
have
the
power
to shut
the
sky
so that
no
rain
shall fall
in the
days
of the
prophecy
of them
and
power
they have
over
the
waters
to turn
them
into
blood
and
to strike
the
earth
with
every
plague
as often as
if
they might desire
And
when
they shall have completed
the
testimony
of them
the
beast
-
coming up
out of
the
abyss
will make
with
them
war
and
will overcome
them
and
will kill
them
And
the
body
of them
[will be] upon
the
street
of
city
the
great
which
is called
figuratively
Sodom
and
Egypt
where
also
the
Lord
of them
was crucified
And
gaze
[those] of
the
peoples
and
tribes
and
tongues
and
nations
upon the
bodies
of them
days
three
and
a half
and
the
bodies
of them
not
they will allow
to be put
into
a tomb
And
those
dwelling
on
the
earth
rejoice
over
them
and
make merry
and
gifts
will send
to one another
because
these
-
two
prophets
have tormented
those
dwelling
upon
the
earth
And
after
the
three
days
and
a half
[the] spirit
of life
from
-
God
entered
into
them
and
they stood
upon
the
feet
of them
and
fear
great
fell
upon
those
beholding
them
And
they heard
a voice
great
out of
-
heaven
saying
to them
Come up
here
And
they went up
to
-
heaven
in
the
cloud
and
beheld
them
the
enemies
of them
And
in
that
-
hour
there was
an earthquake
great
and
a
tenth
of the
city
fell
and
were killed
in
the
earthquake
names
of men
thousand
seven
And
the
rest
terrified
became
and
gave
glory
to the
God
of
heaven
The
woe
-
second
has passed
Behold
the
woe
-
third
is coming
quickly
And
the
seventh
angel
sounded [his] trumpet
and
there were
voices
great
in
-
heaven
saying
Has become
the
kingdom
of the
world
[that] of the
Lord
of us
and
of the
Christ
of Him
and
He will reign
to
the
ages
of the
ages
And
the
twenty
four
elders
-
before
-
God
sitting
on
the
thrones
of them
fell
upon
the
faces
of them
and
worshiped
-
God
saying
We give thanks
to You
Lord
-
God
-
Almighty
the [One]
being
and
who
was
that
You have taken
the
power
of You
-
great
and
have begun to reign
And
the
nations
were enraged
and
came
the
wrath
of You
and
the
time
for the
dead
to be judged
and
to give
the
reward
to the
servants
of You
the
prophets
and
to the
saints
and
to those
fearing
the
name
of You
the
small
and
the
great
and
to destroy
those who
are destroying
the
earth
And
was opened
the
temple
-
of God
-
in
-
heaven
and
was seen
the
ark
of the
covenant
of Him
in
the
temple
of Him
And
there were
flashes of lightning
and
voices
and
thunders
and
an earthquake
and
hail
great
And
a sign
great
appeared
in
-
heaven
a woman
clothed with
the
sun
and
the
moon
under
the
feet
of her
and
on
the
head
of her
a crown
of stars
twelve
and
in
womb
having
And
she cries out
being in travail
and
being in pain
to bring forth
And
was seen
another
sign
in
-
heaven
and
behold
a dragon
red
great
having
heads
seven
and
horns
ten
and
upon
the
heads
of him
seven
royal crowns
And
the
tail
of him
drags
a
third
of the
stars
of
heaven
and
he cast
them
to
the
earth
And
the
dragon
stands
before
the
woman
-
being about
to bring forth
so that
when
she should bring forth
the
child
of her
he might devour
And
she brought forth
a son
male
who
is about
to rule
all
the
nations
with
a rod
of iron
and
was caught up
the
child
of her
to
-
God
and
to
the
throne
of Him
And
the
woman
fled
into
the
wilderness
where
she has
there
a place
having been prepared
by
-
God
so that
there
they should nourish
her
days
one thousand
two hundred
sixty
And
there was
war
in
-
heaven
-
Michael
and
the
angels
of him
-
warred
against
the
dragon
and
the
dragon
warred [back]
and
the
angels
of him
And
not
had he strength
nor
a place
was found
for them
any longer
in
-
heaven
And
was thrown [out]
the
dragon
-
great
the
serpent
-
ancient
who
is called
[the] devil
and
-
Satan
-
deceiving
the
inhabited [world]
whole
He was thrown down
to
the
earth
and
the
angels
of him
with
him
were thrown down
And
I heard
a voice
great
in
-
heaven
saying
Now
have come
the
salvation
and
the
power
and
the
kingdom
of the
God
of us
and
the
authority
the
Christ
of Him
because
has been thrown down
the
accuser
of the
brothers
of us
the [one]
accusing
them
before
the
God
of us
day
and
night
And
they
have overcome
him
by reason
of the
blood
of the
Lamb
and
by reason of
the
word
of the
testimony
of them
and
not
they have loved
the
life
of them
unto
death
Because of
this
rejoice
heavens
and
those
in
them
dwelling
Woe to
the
earth
and
the
sea
because
has come down
the
devil
to
you
having
fury
great
knowing
that
a short
time
he has
And
when
saw
the
dragon
that
he had been thrown down
to
the
earth
he pursued
the
woman
who
had brought forth
the
male [child]
And
were given
to the
woman
the
two
wings
of the
eagle
-
great
so that
she could fly
into
the
wilderness
into
the
place
of her
where
she is nourished
there
a time
and
times
and
half
a time
from
[the] face
of the
serpent
And
cast
the
serpent
out of
the
mouth
of him
after
the
woman
water
as
a river
so that
her
carried away by a flood
he might cause to be
And
helped
the
earth
the
woman
and
opened
the
earth
the
mouth
of it
and
swallowed up
the
river
which
had cast
the
dragon
out of
the
mouth
of him
And
was angry
the
dragon
with
the
woman
and
went
to make
war
with
the
rest
of the
children
of her
-
keeping
the
commandments
-
of God
and
holding
the
testimony
of Jesus
And
he stood
upon
the
sand
of the
sea
And
I saw
out of
the
sea
a beast
rising
having
horns
ten
and
heads
seven
and
on
the
horns
of it
ten
royal crowns
and
upon
the
heads
of it
names
of blasphemy
And
the
beast
that
I saw
was
like
a leopard
and
the
feet
of it
like
a bearâs
and
the
mouth
of it
like
[the] mouth
of a lion
And
gave
to it
the
dragon
the
power
of him
and
the
throne
of him
and
authority
great
And
one
of
the
heads
of it
[was] as
having been slain
to
death
And
the
wound
of
death
of it
was healed
and
marveled
all
the
earth
after
the
beast
And
they worshiped
the
dragon
who
had given
-
authority
to the
beast
and
they worshiped
the
beast
saying
Who
[is] like
the
beast
And
who
is able
to make war
against
it
And
was given
to it
a mouth
speaking
great things
and
blasphemy
and
was given
to it
authority
to act
months
forty
two
And
it opened
the
mouth
of it
unto
blasphemies
against
-
God
to blaspheme
the
name
of Him
and
the
tabernacle
of Him
those
in
-
heaven
dwelling
And
there was given
to it
to make
war
with
the
saints
and
to overcome
them
And
was given
to it
authority
over
every
tribe
and
people
and
tongue
and
nation
And
will worship
it
all
-
dwelling
on
the
earth
of whom
not
have been written
the
names
of them
in
the
book
-
of life
of the
Lamb
-
having been slain
from
[the] founding
of [the] world
If
anyone
has
an ear
let him hear
If
anyone [is to go]
into
captivity
into
captivity
he goes
If
anyone
with
[the] sword
is to be killed
it is necessary for
him
by
[the] sword
to be killed
Here
is
the
endurance
and
the
faith
of the
saints
And
I saw
another
beast
rising
out of
the
earth
and
it had
horns
two
like
a lamb
and
it was speaking
like
a dragon
And
the
authority
of the
first
beast
all
it exercises
on behalf
of it
and
causes
the
earth
and
those
in
it
dwelling
that
they will worship
the
beast
-
first
of whom
had been healed
the
wound
-
fatal
of it
And
it works
signs
great
so that
even
fire
it should cause
out of
-
heaven
to come down
to
the
earth
in the presence
-
of men
And
it deceives
those
dwelling
on
the
earth
by reason of
the
signs
that
were given
to it
to perform
before
the
beast
telling
those
dwelling
on
the
earth
to make
an image
to the
beast
that
has
the
wound
of the
sword
and
has lived
And
there was given
to it
to give
breath
to the
image
of the
beast
so that
also
should speak
the
image
of the
beast
and
should cause
that
as many as
if
not
would worship
the
image
of the
beast
would be killed
And
it causes
all
the
small
and
the
great
and
the
rich
and
the
poor
and
the
free
and
the
servants
that
it should give
them
a mark
on
the
hand
of them
-
right
or
on
the
forehead
of them
and
that
no
one
should be able
to buy
or
to sell
if
not
the [one]
having
the
mark
the
name
of the
beast
or
the
number
of the
name
of it
Here
the
wisdom
is
The [one]
having
understanding
let him count
the
number
of the
beast
number
for
a manâs
it is
and
the
number [is]
of it
six hundred
sixty
six
And
I looked
and
behold
the
Lamb
was standing
upon
-
Mount
Zion
and
with
Him
one hundred
forty
four
thousand
having
the
name
of Him
and
the
name
of the
Father
of Him
having been written
on
the
foreheads
of them
And
I heard
a voice
out of
-
heaven
as
[the] sound
of waters
many
and
as
[the] sound
of thunder
loud
And
the
voice
that
I heard
[was] like that
of harpists
harping
with
the
harps
of them
And
they are singing
a song
new
before
the
throne
and
before
the
four
living creatures
and
the
elders
And
no one
was able
to learn
the
song
if
not
the
one hundred
forty
four
thousand
-
having been redeemed
from
the
earth
These
are
they who
with
women
not
have not been defiled
pure
for
they are
these
-
following
the
Lamb
wherever
-
He shall go
These
have been redeemed
out from
-
men
[as] firstfruits
-
to God
and
to the
Lamb
And
in
the
mouth
of them
not
was found
a lie
blameless
they are
And
I saw
another
angel
flying
in
mid-heaven
having
[the] glad tidings
everlasting
to preach
upon
those
dwelling
on
the
earth
and
upon
every
nation
and
tribe
and
tongue
and
people
saying
in
a voice
loud
Fear
-
God
and
give
Him
glory
because
has come
the
hour
of the
judgment
of Him
And
worship
the [One]
having made
-
heaven
and
the
earth
and
sea
and
springs
of waters
And
another
angel
a second
followed
saying
Fallen
Fallen is
Babylon
the
great
who
of
the
wine
-
of wrath
for the
immorality
of her
she has given to drink
all
the
Gentiles
And
another
angel
a third
followed
them
saying
in
a voice
loud
If
anyone
worships
the
beast
and
the
image
of it
and
receives
a mark
on
the
forehead
of him
or
upon
the
hand
of him
also
he
will drink
of
the
wine
of the
anger
-
of God
-
having been mixed
undiluted
in
the
cup
of the
wrath
of Him
and
he will be tormented
in
fire
and
brimstone
before
[the] angels
holy
and
before
the
Lamb
And
the
smoke
of the
torment
of them
to
ages
of ages
goes up
and
not
have
rest
day
and
night
those
worshiping
the
beast
and
the
image
of it
and
if
anyone
receives
the
mark
of the
name
of it
Here
the
endurance
of the
saints
is
those
keeping
the
commandments
-
of God
and
the
faith
of Jesus
And
I heard
a voice
out of
-
heaven
saying
Write
Blessed [are]
the
dead
-
in
the Lord
dying
from
Yes
says
the
Spirit
so that
they will rest
from
the
labors
of them
-
for
the works
of them
follow
with
them
And
I looked
and
behold
a cloud
white
and
upon
the
cloud
is sitting [One]
like
[the] Son
of Man
having
on
the
head
of Him
a crown
golden
and
in
the
hand
of Him
a sickle
sharp
And
another
angel
came out
of
the
temple
crying
in
a voice
loud
to the [One]
sitting
on
the
cloud
Put forth
the
sickle
of You
and
reap
because
has come
the
hour
to reap
because
has ripened
the
harvest
of the
earth
And
swung
the [One]
sitting
upon
the
cloud
the
sickle
of Him
upon
the
earth
and
was harvested
the
earth
And
another
angel
came
out of
the
temple
-
in
-
heaven
having
also
he
a sickle
sharp
And
another
angel
came
out of
the
altar
-
having
authority
over
the
fire
and
he called
in a voice
loud
to the [one]
having
the
sickle
-
sharp
saying
Put forth
your
-
sickle
-
sharp
and
gather
the
clusters
from the
vine
of the
earth
because
have fully ripened
the
grapes
of it
And
put forth
the
angel
the
sickle
of him
to
the
earth
and
gathered
the
vine
of the
earth
and
cast [them]
into
the
winepress
of the
wrath
-
of God
-
great
And
was trodden
the
winepress
outside
the
city
and
flowed
blood
out of
the
winepress
as high as
the
bridles
of the
horses
to the distance of
stadia
one thousand
six hundred
And
I saw
another
sign
in
-
heaven
great
and
wonderful
angels
seven
having
plagues
seven
the
last
because
in
them
was completed
the
wrath
-
of God
And
I saw
[something] like
a sea
of glass
mingled
with fire
and
those
conquering
over
the
beast
and
of
the
image
of it
and
over
the
number
of the
name
of it
standing
upon
the
sea
of the
glass
having
harps
-
of God
And
they are singing
the
song
of Moses
the
servant
of
God
and
the
song
of the
Lamb
saying
Great
and
wonderful [are]
the
works
of You
Lord
-
God
the
Almighty
Righteous
and
true [are]
the
ways
of You
O
King
of the
nations
Who
no
not
should fear [You]
O Lord
and
will glorify
the
name
of You
For [You]
alone [are]
holy
For
all
the
nations
will come
and
will worship
before
You
because
the
righteous acts
of You
have been revealed
And
after
these things
I looked
and
was opened
the
temple
of the
tabernacle
of the
testimony
in
-
heaven
And
came forth
the
seven
angels
-
having
the
seven
plagues
out
of the
temple
having been clothed in
linen
pure
bright
and
having been girded with
around
the
chests
sashes
golden
And
one
of
the
four
living creatures
gave
to the
seven
angels
seven
bowls
golden
full
of the
wrath
-
of God
the [One]
living
to
the
ages
of the
ages
And
was filled
the
temple
with smoke
from
the
glory
-
of God
and
from
the
power
of Him
and
no one
was able
to enter
into
the
temple
until
were completed
the
seven
plagues
of the
seven
angels
And
I heard
[a] loud
voice
from
the
temple
saying
to the
seven
angels
Go
and
pour out
the
seven
bowls
of the
wrath
-
of God
into
the
earth
And
departed
the
first
and
poured out
the
bowl
of him
into
the
earth
and
came
a sore
evil
and
grievous
upon
the
men
-
having
the
mark
of the
beast
and
those
worshiping
the
image
of it
And
the
second
poured out
the
bowl
of him
into
the
sea
and
it became
blood
as
of [one] dead
and
every
soul
living
died
that was
in
the
sea
And
the
third
poured out
the
bowl
of him
into
the
rivers
and
the
springs
of the
waters
and
they became
blood
And
I heard
the
angel
of the
waters
saying
Righteous
are You
the [One]
being
and
-
having been
O
holy One
because
these things
You have judged
because
[the] blood
of saints
and
of prophets
they have poured out
and
blood
to them
You have given
to drink
worthy
they are
And
I heard
the
altar
saying
Yes
Lord
-
God
-
Almighty
true
and
righteous [are]
the
judgments
of You
And
the
fourth
poured out
the
bowl
of him
upon
the
sun
and
there was given
to it
to scorch
-
men
with
fire
And
were scorched
the
men
with heat
great
and
they cursed
the
name
-
of God
the [One]
having
-
authority
over
the
plagues
these
and
not
did they repent
to give
Him
glory
And
the
fifth
poured out
the
bowl
of him
upon
the
throne
of the
beast
and
became
the
kingdom
of it
darkened
and
they were gnawing
the
tongues
of them
for
the
distress
and
they cursed
the
God
of
heaven
on account of
the
distresses
of them
and
on account of
the
sores
of them
and
not
they did repent
of
the
works
of them
And
the
sixth
poured out
the
bowl
of him
upon
the
river
-
great
Euphrates
and
was dried up
the
water
of it
so that
might be prepared
the
way
of the
kings
-
of the
rising
of the sun
And
I saw [coming]
out of
the
mouth
of the
dragon
and
out of
the
mouth
of the
beast
and
out of
the
mouth
of the
false prophet
spirits
three
unclean
like
frogs
they are
for
spirits
of demons
performing
signs
which
go forth
to
the
kings
of the
inhabited [world]
whole
to gather together
them
unto
the
battle
of the
day
-
great
-
of God
the
Almighty
Behold
I am coming
like
a thief
Blessed [is]
the [one]
watching
and
keeping
the
garments
of him
so that
not
naked
he should walk
and
they might see
the
shame
of him
And
he gathered together
them
unto
the
place
-
called
in Hebrew
Armageddon
And
the
seventh
poured out
the
bowl
of him
upon
the
air
and
came out
a voice
loud
from
the
temple
from
the
throne
saying
It is done
And
there were
flashes of lightning
and
voices
and
thunders
and
an earthquake
there was
great
such as
not
had there been
since
-
men
were
upon
the
earth
so great
[was the] earthquake
so
mighty
And
was [split]
the
city
-
great
into
three
parts
and
the
cities
of the
nations
fell
and
Babylon
the
great
was remembered
before
-
God
to give
her
the
cup
of the
wine
of the
fury
the
wrath
of Him
And
every
island
fled
and
mountains
not
were to be found
And
a hail
great
about
a talent weight
comes down
out of
-
heaven
upon
the
men
And
blasphemed
the
men
-
God
on account of
the
plague
of the
hail
for
severe
is
the
plague
of it
exceedingly
And
came
one
of
the
seven
angels
-
having
the
seven
bowls
and
spoke
with
me
saying
Come here
I will show
you
the
punishment
of the
prostitute
-
great
the [one]
sitting
upon
waters
many
with
whom
have committed sexual immorality
the
kings
of the
earth
and
have been made drunk
those that
dwelling
on the
earth
with
the
wine
of the
sexual immorality
of her
And
he carried away
me
into
a wilderness
in
[the] Spirit
and
I saw
a woman
sitting
upon
a beast
scarlet
being full
of names
of blasphemy
having
heads
seven
and
horns
ten
And
the
woman
was
clothed in
purple
and
scarlet
and
adorned
with gold
and
stone
precious
and
pearls
holding
a cup
golden
in
the
hand
of her
being full
of abominations
and
the
impurity
of the
sexual immorality
of her
And
upon
the
forehead
of her
a name
was written
a mystery
Babylon
the
Great
the
mother
of the
prostitutes
and
of the
abominations
of the
earth
And
I saw
the
woman
being drunk
with
the
blood
of the
saints
and
with
the
blood
of the
witnesses
of Jesus
And
I marveled
having seen
her
with wonder
great
And
said
to me
the
angel
Because of
why
did you marvel
I
will tell
you
the
mystery
of the
woman
and
of the
beast
-
carrying
her
-
having
the
seven
heads
and
the
ten
horns
The
beast
that
you saw
was
and
not
is
and
is about
to come up
out of
the
abyss
and
into
destruction
go
and
will wonder
those
dwelling
on
the
earth
whose
not
are written
-
names
in
the
book
-
of life
from
[the] foundation
of [the] world
seeing
the
beast
which
was
and
not
is
and yet
will be
Here [is]
the
mind
-
having
wisdom
The
seven
heads
seven
mountains
are
where
the
woman
sits
on
them
And
kings
seven
there are
The
five
are fallen
the
one
is
the
other
not yet
has come
and
when
he shall have come
a little while
him
it behooves
to remain
And
the
beast
which
was
and
not
is
also
himself
an eighth
is
and
of
the
seven
is
and
into
destruction
goes
And
the
ten
horns
which
you saw
ten
kings
are
who
a kingdom
not yet
have received
but
authority
as
kings
one
hour
receive
along with
the
beast
These
one
mind
have
and
the
power
and
authority
of themselves
to the
beast
they shall give up
These
with
the
Lamb
war will make
and
the
Lamb
will overcome
them
because
Lord
of lords
He is
and
King
of kings
and
those
with
Him
[are] called
and
chosen
and
faithful
And
he says
to me
The
waters
that
you saw
where
the
prostitute
sits
peoples
and
multitudes
are
and
nations
and
tongues
And
the
ten
horns
that
you saw
and
the
beast
these
will hate
the
prostitute
and
desolate
will make
her
and
naked
and
the
flesh
of her
they will eat
and
her
they will burn
with
fire
-
For
God
has put
into
the
hearts
of them
to do
the
purpose
of Him
and
to do
one
purpose
and
to give
the
kingdom
of them
to the
beast
until
will be fulfilled
the
words
-
of God
And
the
woman
whom
you saw
is
the
city
-
great
-
having
kingship
over
the
kings
of the
earth
After
these things
I saw
another
angel
descending
out of
-
heaven
having
authority
great
and
the
earth
was illuminated
from
the
glory
of him
And
he cried out
in
a mighty
voice
saying
Fallen
Fallen is
Babylon
the
great
And
she has become
a habitation
of demons
and
a prison
of every
spirit
unclean
and
a prison
of every
bird
unclean
and
having been hated
For
of
the
wine
of the
wrath
of the
sexual immorality
of her
have drunk
all
the
nations
and
the
kings
of the
earth
with
her
have committed sexual immorality
and
the
merchants
of the
earth
through
the
power
of the
sensuality
of her
have been enriched
And
I heard
another
voice
from
-
heaven
saying
Come
the
people
of me
out of
her
so that
not
you may have fellowship
in the
sins
of her
and
of
the
plagues
of her
so that
not
you may receive
For
have been heaped
her
-
sins
as high as
-
heaven
and
has remembered
-
God
the
iniquities
of her
Give back
to her
as
also
she
has rendered
and
pay back double
to her
twofold
according to
the
works
of her
In
the
cup
which
she has mixed
mix
to her
double
So much as
she has glorified
herself
and
lived in luxury
as much
give
to her
torment
and
misery
because
in
the
heart
of herself
she says
-
I sit
[as] a queen
and
a widow
never
I am
and
mourning
never
not
shall I see
Because of
this
in
one
day
will come
the
plagues
of her
death
and
misery
and
famine
and
with
fire
she will be burned up
because
mighty [is the]
Lord
-
God
the [One]
having judged
her
And
will weep
and
will wail
for
her
the
kings
of the
earth
the [ones]
with
her
having committed sexual immorality
and
having lived luxuriously
when
they see
the
smoke
of the
burning
of her
from
afar
standing
because of
the
fear
of the
torment
of her
saying
Woe
woe
the
city
-
great
Babylon
the
city
-
strong
For [in]
one
hour
has come
the
judgment
of you
And
the
merchants
of the
earth
weep
and
mourn
for
her
because
the
cargo
of them
no one
buys
no longer
cargo
of gold
and
of silver
and
of stone
precious
and
of pearls
and
of fine linen
and
of purple
and
of silk
and
of scarlet
and
all
wood
citron
and
every
article
of ivory
and
every
article
of
wood
most precious
and
of bronze
and
of iron
and
of marble
and
cinnamon
and
spice
and
incense
and
myrrh
and
frankincense
and
wine
and
oil
and
finest flour
and
wheat
and
cattle
and
sheep
and
of horses
and
of chariots
and
of slaves
and
souls
of men
And
the
ripe fruit
of you
of the
desire
of the
soul
are departed
from
you
and
all
the
sumptuous things
and
the
splendid things
have departed
from
you
and
no longer
no
not
them
they will find
The
merchants
of these things
-
having been enriched
from
her
from
afar
will stand
because of
the
fear
of the
torment
of her
weeping
and
mourning
saying
Woe
woe
the
city
-
great
-
having been clothed with
fine linen
and
purple
and
scarlet
and
having been adorned
with
gold
and
stone
precious
and
pearl
For [in]
one
hour
has been brought to desolation
-
such great
wealth
And
every
shipmaster
and
all
those
to
a place
sailing
and
sailors
and
as many as
the
sea
trade by
at
a distance
stood
and
were crying out
seeing
the
smoke
of the
burning
of her
saying
What [is]
like
the
city
-
great
And
they cast
dust
upon
the
heads
of them
and
they were crying out
weeping
and
mourning
saying
Woe
woe
the
city
-
great
in
which
were enriched
all
those
having
-
ships
in
the
sea
through
the
wealth
of her
For
in one
hour
she has been brought to desolation
Rejoice
over
her
O heaven
and
-
[you] saints
and
-
apostles
and
-
prophets
because
did judge
-
God
the
judgment
for you
against
her
And
took up
one
angel
a mighty
stone
like
a millstone
great
and
cast [it]
into
the
sea
saying
Thus
with violence
will be cast down
Babylon
the
great
city
and
no
not
shall be found
any longer
And
sound
of harpists
and
musicians
and
flute players
and
trumpeters
no
not
shall be heard
in
you
any longer
And
any
craftsmen
of any
craft
no
not
shall be found
in
you
any longer
and
[the] sound
of a millstone
no
not
shall be heard
in
you
any longer
And
[the] light
of lamp
no
not
shall shine
in
you
any longer
and
[the] voice
of a bridegroom
and
a bride
no
not
shall be heard
in
you
any longer
for
the
merchants
of you
were
the
great ones
of the
earth
because
by
the
sorcery
of you
were deceived
all
the
nations
And
in
her
[the] blood
of prophets
and
of saints
was found
and
of all
those
having been slain
on
the
earth
After
these things
I heard
[something] like
a voice
loud
of a multitude
great
in
-
heaven
crying out
Hallelujah
The
salvation
and
the
glory
and
the
power
to the
God
of us
For
true
and
righteous [are]
the
judgments
of Him
because
He has judged
the
prostitute
-
great
who
had corrupted
the
earth
with
the
sexual immorality
of her
and
He has avenged
the
blood
of the
servants
of Him
out of
[the] hand
of her
And
a second time
they said
Hallelujah
And
the
smoke
of her
goes up
to
the
ages
of the
ages
And
fell down
the
elders
-
twenty
four
and
the
four
living creatures
and
they worshiped
-
God
the [One]
sitting
on
the
throne
saying
Amen
Hallelujah
And
a voice
from
the
throne
came forth
saying
Praise
the
God
of us
all
the
servants
of Him
those
fearing
Him
the
small
and
the
great
And
I heard
[something] like
[the] voice
of a multitude
great
and
like
[the] sound
of waters
many
and
like
a sound
of thunders
mighty
saying
Hallelujah
For
has reigned
[the] Lord
-
God
of us
the
Almighty
We should rejoice
and
should exult
and
will give
the
glory
to Him
because
has come
the
marriage
of the
Lamb
and
the
bride
of Him
has made ready
herself
And
it was given
to her
that
she should be clothed in
fine linen
bright
pure
-
For
the fine linen
the
righteousness acts
of the
saints
is
And
he says
to me
Write
Blessed [are]
those
to
the
supper
of the
marriage
of the
Lamb
having been invited
And
he says
to me
These
the
words
true
-
of God
are
And
I fell
before
the
feet
of him
to worship
to him
And
he says
to me
See that you
not
A fellow servant
with you
I am
and
the
brothers
of you
-
holding
the
testimony
of Jesus
-
God
worship
The
for
testimony
of Jesus
is
the
spirit
-
of prophecy
And
I saw
-
heaven
having been opened
and
behold
a horse
white
and
the [One]
sitting
upon
it
called
Faithful
and
True
and
in
righteousness
He judges
and
makes war
-
And
the eyes
of Him
a flame
of fire
and
upon
the
head
of Him
royal crowns
many
having
a name
having been written
which
no one
knows
if
not
He Himself
and
having been clothed with
a garment
having been dipped
in blood
And
is called
the
name
of Him
The
Word
-
of God
And
the
armies
who were
in
-
heaven
were following
Him
upon
horses
white
having been clothed in
fine linen
white
pure
And
out of
the
mouth
of Him
goes forth
a sword
sharp
so that
with
it
He may strike down
the
nations
and
He
will shepherd
them
with
a rod
of iron
And
He
treads
the
press
of the
wine
of the
fury
of the
wrath
-
of God
the
Almighty
And
He has
upon
the
robe
and
upon
the
thigh
of Him
a name
having been written
King
of Kings
and
Lord
of Lords
And
I saw
one
angel
standing
in
the
sun
and
he cried out
in
a voice
loud
saying
to all
the
birds
-
flying
in
mid-heaven
Come
gather yourselves
unto
the
supper
-
great
-
of God
so that
you may eat
[the] flesh
of kings
and
[the] flesh
of commanders
and
[the] flesh
of mighty [men]
and
[the] flesh
of horses
and
of those
sitting
on
them
and
[the] flesh
of all
free
both
and
slaves
and
small
and
great
And
I saw
the
beast
and
the
kings
of the
earth
and
the
armies
of them
having been gathered together
to make
-
war
with
the [One]
sitting
on
the
horse
and
with
the
army
of Him
And
was captured
the
beast
and
with
him
the
false prophet
the [one]
having done
the
signs
before
him
by
which
he deceived
those
having received
the
mark
of the
beast
and
those
worshiping
the
image
of it
living
were cast
the
two
into
the
lake
-
of fire
-
burning
with
brimstone
And
the
rest
were killed
with
the
sword
of the [One]
sitting
on
the
horse
-
having gone forth
out of
the
mouth
of him
And
all
the
birds
were filled
with
the
flesh
of them
And
I saw
an angel
descending
out of
-
heaven
holding
the
key
of the
Abyss
and
a chain
great
in
the
hand
of him
And
he seized
the
dragon
the
serpent
-
ancient
who
is
[the] devil
and
-
Satan
and
bound
him
for a thousand
years
And
he cast
him
into
the
Abyss
and
shut
and
sealed [it]
over
him
so that
not
he should deceive
any longer
the
nations
until
were completed
the
thousand
years
After these
things
it is necessary for
to be released
him
for a little
time


























































The
rest
of the
dead
not
lived again
until
shall have been completed
the
thousand
years
This [is]
the
resurrection
-
first
Blessed
and
holy [is]
the [one]
having
a part
in
the
resurrection
-
first
Over
these
the
second
death
not
has
power
but
they will be
priests
-
of God
and
-
of Christ
and
will reign
with
Him
a
thousand
years
And
when
shall have been completed
the
thousand
years
will be released
-
Satan
out of
the
prison
of him
and
will go out
to deceive
the
nations
-
in
the
four
corners
of the
earth
-
Gog
and
Magog
to gather together
them
unto
the
war
of whom
the
number [is]
of them
like
the
sand
of the
sea
And
they marched up
over
the
breadth
of the
earth
and
encircled
the
camp
of the
saints
and
the
city
-
having been beloved
But
came down
fire
out of
-
heaven
and
devoured
them
And
the
devil
the [one]
deceiving
them
was cast
into
the
lake
-
of fire
and
of sulfur
where [are]
also
the
beast
and
the
false prophet
and
they will be tormented
day
and
night
to
the
ages
of the
ages
And
I saw
a throne
great
white
and
the [One]
sitting
on
it
whose
from
-
face
fled
the
earth
and
-
heaven
and
place
not
was found
for them
And
I saw
the
dead
-
great
and
-
small
standing
before
the
throne
and
books
were opened
And
another
book
was opened
which
is
the [one]
of life
And
were judged
the
dead
out of
the things
having been written
in
the
books
according to
the
deeds
of them
And
gave up
the
sea
the
dead
who were
in
it
and
-
Death
and
-
Hades
gave up
the
dead
who were
in
them
and
they were judged
each [of them]
according to
the
works
of them
And
-
Death
and
-
Hades
were cast
into
the
lake
-
of fire
This
the
death
-
second
is
the
lake
of
fire
And
if
anyone
not
was found
in
the
book
-
of life
having been written
he was cast
into
the
lake
-
of fire
And
I saw
a heaven
new
and
an earth
new
-
for
the first
heaven
and
the
first
earth
had passed away
and
the
sea
not
is
any longer
And
the
city
-
holy
[the] Jerusalem
new
I saw
coming down
out of
-
heaven
from
-
God
having been prepared
as
a bride
having been adorned
for the
husband
of her
And
I heard
a voice
great
from
the
throne
saying
Behold
the
tabernacle
-
of God
[is] with
-
men
and
He will tabernacle
with
them
and
they
peoples
of Him
will be
and
Himself
-
God
with
them
will be
And
He will wipe away
every
tear
from
the
eyes
of them
and
-
death
not
will be
any longer
nor
mourning
nor
crying
nor
pain
not
they will be
any longer
because
the
former things
have passed away
And
said
the [One]
sitting
on
the
throne
Behold
new
I make
all things
And
He says
Write [this]
because
these
the
words
faithful
and
true
are
And
He said
to me
It is done
I
the
Alpha
and
the
Omega
the
beginning
and
the
end
I
to the [one]
thirsting
will give
of
the
spring
of the
water
-
of life
freely
The [one]
overcoming
will inherit
all things
and
I will be
his
God
and
he
will be
My
son
-
But
to the cowardly
and
unbelieving
and
having become abominable
and
murderers
and
the sexually immoral
and
sorcerers
and
idolaters
and
all
-
liars
the
portion
of them
[is] in
the
lake
-
burning
with fire
and
brimstone
which
is
the
death
-
second
And
came
one
of
the
seven
angels
-
having
the
seven
bowls
-
being full
of the
seven
plagues
-
last
and
spoke
with
me
saying
Come here
I will show
you
the
bride
the
wife
of the
Lamb
And
he carried away
me
in
[the] Spirit
to
a mountain
great
and
high
and
he showed
me
the
city
-
holy
Jerusalem
descending
out of
-
heaven
from
-
God
having
the
glory
-
of God
The
radiance
of it
[was] like
a stone
most precious
like
a stone
jasper
being clear as crystal
having
a wall
great
and
high
having
gates
twelve
and
at
the
gates
angels
twelve
and
names
having been inscribed
which
are
of the
twelve
tribes
of [the] sons
of Israel
On
[the] east
[were] gates
three
and
on
[the] north
gates
three
and
on
[the] south
gates
three
and
on
[the] west
gates
three
And
the
wall
of the
city
had
foundations
twelve
and
in
them
[the] twelve
names
of the
twelve
apostles
of the
Lamb
And
the [one]
speaking
with
me
had
a measuring
reed
golden
so that
he could measure
the
city
and
the
gates
of it
and
the
wall
of it
And
the
city
foursquare
lies
and
the
length
of it [is]
the same as
the
width
And
he measured
the
city
with the
reed
at
stadia
twelve
thousand
The
length
and
the
breadth
and
the
height
of it
equal
are
And
he measured
the
wall
of it
one hundred
forty
four
cubits
[the] measure
of man
that
is
of the angel
And
the
structure
of the
wall
of it
[was] jasper
and
the
city
gold
pure
like
glass
clear
the
foundations
of the
wall
of the
city
with every
stone
precious
having been adorned
the
foundation
-
first
jasper
the
second
sapphire
the
third
chalcedony
the
fourth
emerald
the
fifth
sardonyx
the
sixth
sardius
the
seventh
chrysolite
the
eighth
beryl
the
ninth
topaz
the
tenth
chrysoprase
the
eleventh
jacinth
the
twelfth
amethyst
And
the
twelve
gates [were]
twelve
pearls
respectively
one
each
of the
gates
was
of
one
pearl
and
the
street
of the
city
gold
pure
as
glass
transparent
And
temple
not
I saw
in
it
-
for
the Lord
-
God
-
Almighty
temple
of it
is
and
the
Lamb
And
the
city
no
need
has
of the
sun
nor
of the
moon
that
they should shine
in it
the
for
glory
-
of God
enlightened
it
and
the
lamp
of it
[is] the
Lamb
And
will walk
the
nations
by
the
light
of it
and
the
kings
of the
earth
bring
the
glory
of them
into
it
And
the
gates
of it
no
not
shall be shut
by day
night
for
not
will be
there
And
they will bring
the
glory
and
the
honor
of the
nations
into
it
And
no
not
shall enter
into
it
anything
defiling
and
those
practicing
abomination
and
a lie
if
not
those
having been written
in
the
book
-
of life
of the
Lamb
And
he showed
me
a river
of water
of life
clear
as
crystal
flowing
out of
the
throne
-
of God
and
of the
Lamb
In
the middle
of the
street
of it
and
of the
river
on this side
and
on that side
[was a] tree
of life
producing
fruits
twelve
according to
month
each
yielding
the
fruit
of it
and
the
leaves
of the
tree
[are] for
[the] healing
of the
nations
And
any
curse
not
there will be
any longer
And
the
throne
-
of God
and
of the
Lamb
in
it
will be
and
the
servants
of Him
will serve
Him
And
they will see
the
face
of Him
and
the
name
of Him
[will be] on
the
foreheads
of them
And
night
not
there will be
there
and
not
they have
need
of [the] light
of a lamp
and
of [the] light
of [the] sun
because
[the] Lord
-
God
will enlighten
upon
them
and
they will reign
to
the
ages
of the
ages
And
he said
to me
These
-
words
[are] faithful
and
true
And
the
Lord
the
God
of the
spirits
of the
prophets
sent
the
angel
of Him
to show
the
servants
of Him
the things that
must
come to pass
in
quickness
And
behold
I am coming
quickly
Blessed [is]
the [one]
keeping
the
words
of the
prophecy
of the
book
this
And I
John
[am] the [one]
hearing
and
seeing
these things
And
when
I heard
and
saw
I fell down
to worship
before
the
feet
of the
angel
-
showing
me
these things
And
he says
to me
See that you
not
Fellow servant
of you
I am
and
with the
brothers
of you
the
prophets
and
with those
keeping
the
words
of the
book
this
-
God
worship
And
he says
to me
Not
seal
the
words
of the
prophecy
of the
book
this
the
time
for
near
is
The [one]
being unrighteous
let him be unrighteous
still
and
he who
is filthy
let him be filthy
still
and
he who
[is] righteous
righteousness
let him practice
still
and
he who [is]
holy
let him be holy
still
Behold
I am coming
quickly
and
the
reward
of Me
[is] with
Me
to give
to each
as
the
work
is
his
I [am]
the
Alpha
and
the
Omega
the
First
and
the
Last
the
Beginning
and
the
End
Blessed [are]
those
washing
the
robes
of them
that
will be
the
right
of them
to
the
tree
-
of life
and
by the
gates
they shall enter
into
the
city
Outside [are]
the
dogs
and
the
sorcerers
and
the
sexually immoral
and
the
murderers
and
the
idolaters
and
everyone
loving
and
practicing
falsehood
I
Jesus
have sent
the
angel
of Me
to testify
to you
these things
in
the
churches
I
am
the
root
and
the
offspring
of David
the
star

And
the
Spirit
and
the

say
Come
And
the [one]
hearing
let him say
Come
And
the [one]
thirsting
let him come
the [one]
desiring
let him take
[the] water
of life
freely
Testify
I
to everyone
-

the
words

prophecy
of the
book
this
If
anyone
should add
to
these things
will add
-
God
unto
him
the
plagues
-
having been written
in
the
book
this
And
if
anyone
should take away
from
the
words
of the
book

prophecy
this
will take away

God

now
of him

behold
168637	an angel

168640	in

appeared
to him
saying
Joseph
168647	son
of David
not
you should fear
to receive
Mary
168654	[as] the
168656	wife
of you
that
for
168661	in
her
having been conceived
168665	from
168667	[the] Spirit
is
Holy
She will bear
then
a son
and
you will call
168676	the
168678	name
of Him
Jesus
He
for
will save
168685	the
168687	people
of Him
168690	from
168692	the
168694	sins
of them
168697	This
then
all
has come to pass
that
may be fulfilled
that
having been spoken
168706	by
the Lord
168709	through
168711	the
prophet
saying
Behold
168716	the
virgin
168719	in
womb
will hold
and
will bear
a son
and
they will call
168728	the
168730	name
of Him
Immanuel
which
168735	is
being translated
168738	With
us
168741	-
God
Having been awoken
then
168746	-
Joseph
168749	from
168751	the
sleep
he did
as
had commanded
him
168758	the
168760	angel
of [the] Lord
and
received
168765	the
168767	wife
of him
and
not
knew
her
168774	until
that
she had brought forth
a son
and
he called
168781	the
168783	name
of Him
Jesus
168787	-
Now
Jesus
having been born
168792	in
168794	Bethlehem
168796	-
of Judea
168799	in
168801	[the] days
of Herod
168804	the
king
behold
Magi
168809	from [the]
east
arrived
168813	in
Jerusalem
saying
Where
is
168819	the [One]
168821	having been born
168823	King
168825	of the
Jews
We saw
for
168830	of Him
168832	the
star
168835	in
168837	the
east
and
are come
to worship
Him
Having heard
then
168846	-
King
Herod
he was troubled
and
168852	all
Jerusalem
168855	with
him
And
having gathered together
168860	all
168862	the
chief priests
and
168866	scribes
168868	of the
people
he was inquiring
168872	of
them
where
168876	the
Christ
was to be born
-
And
they said
to him
168884	In
168886	Bethlehem
168888	-
of Judea
thus
for
has it been written
168894	through
168896	the
prophet
And
you
Bethlehem
168902	land
of Judah
by no means
least
are
168908	among
168910	the
168912	rulers
of Judah
168915	out
of you
for
will go forth
[One] leading
who
will shepherd
168923	the
168925	people
of Me
168928	-
Israel
Then
Herod
secretly
having called
168935	the
Magi
inquired exactly
168939	of
them
168942	the
168944	time
168946	of the
168948	appearing
star
And
having sent
them
168954	to
Bethlehem
he said
Having gone
search
carefully
168961	for
168963	the
Child
when
then
You shall have found [Him]
bring word back
to me
so that
I also
having come
may worship
Him
-
And
having heard
168979	the
king
they went away
and
behold
168985	the
star
which
they saw
168990	in
168992	the
east
went before
them
until
having arrived
it stood
169000	over
where
was
169004	the
Child
Having seen
now
169009	the
star
they rejoiced [with]
169013	joy
great
exceedingly
And
having come
169019	into
169021	the
house
they found
169025	the
169027	Child
169029	with
Mary
169032	the
169034	mother
of Him
and
having fallen down
they worshiped
Him
and
having opened
169043	the
169045	treasures
of them
they offered
to Him
gifts
gold
and
frankincense
and
myrrh
And
having been divinely warned
169058	in
a dream
not
to return
169063	to
Herod
169066	by
169068	another
route
they withdrew
169072	into
169074	the
169076	country
of them
Having withdrawn
then
of them
behold
169083	an angel
of [the] Lord
appears
169087	in
a dream
169090	-
to Joseph
saying
Having arisen
take
169096	the
Child
and
169100	the
169102	mother
of Him
and
flee
169107	into
Egypt
and
remain
there
until
-
I should tell
you
is about
for
Herod
to seek
169121	the
Child
-
to destroy
Him
-
And
having arisen
he took
169131	the
Child
and
169135	the
169137	mother
of Him
by night
and
withdrew
169143	into
Egypt
and
he remained
there
169149	until
169151	the
169153	death
of Herod
so that
it might be fulfilled
that
having been spoken
169160	by
[the] Lord
169163	through
169165	the
prophet
saying
169169	Out
of Egypt
have I called
169173	the
169175	Son
of me
Then
Herod
having seen
that
he had been outwitted
169183	by
169185	the
Magi
was enraged
intensely
and
having sent forth
he put to death
169193	all
169195	the
boys
169198	that [were]
169200	in
Bethlehem
and

169213	from
two years old
and
under

169220	the
time
which
he had ascertained
169225	from
169227	the
Magi
Then
was fulfilled
that
having been spoken
169234	by
Jeremiah
169237	the
prophet
saying
A voice
169242	in
Ramah
was heard
weeping
and
169248	mourning
great
Rachel
weeping [for]
169253	the
169255	children
of her
and
not
would
be comforted
because
no more
are they
Having died
now
169267	-
of Herod
behold
169271	an angel
of [the] Lord
appears
169275	in
a dream
169278	to
Joseph
169281	in
Egypt
saying
Having arisen
take
169287	the
Child
and
169291	the
169293	mother
of Him
and
go
169298	into
169300	[the] land
of Israel
they have died
for
those
seeking
169307	the
169309	life
169311	of the
Child
-
And
having arisen
he took
169318	the
Child
and
169322	the
169324	mother
of Him
and
came
169329	into
169331	[the] land
of Israel
Having heard
now
that
Archelaus
reigns over
169339	-
Judea
169342	in place of
169344	the
169346	father
of him
Herod
he was afraid
there
to go
having been divinely warned
now
169355	in
a dream
he withdrew
169359	into
169361	the
169363	district
169365	-
of Galilee
and
having come
he dwelt
169371	in
169373	a city
being called
Nazareth
so that
it should be fulfilled
that
having been spoken
169381	through
169383	the
prophets
that
A Nazarene
He will be called
169389	In
then
169393	the
days
those
comes
John
169399	the
Baptist
preaching
169403	in
169405	the
169407	wilderness
169409	-
of Judea
saying
Repent
has drawn near
for
169416	the
169418	kingdom
169420	of the
heavens
This
for
is
the [One]
having been spoken of
169428	through
Isaiah
169431	the
prophet
saying
169435	[The] voice
of one crying
169438	in
169440	the
wilderness
Prepare
169444	the
169446	way
of [the] Lord
straight
make
169451	the
169453	paths
of Him
169456	Himself
now
169459	-
John
had
169463	the
169465	garment
of him
169468	of
169470	hair
of a camel
and
169474	a belt
of leather
169477	around
169479	the
169481	waist
of him
169484	-
and
169487	the food
was
of him
locusts
and
169493	honey
wild
At that time
were going out
169498	to
him
Jerusalem
and
169503	all
169505	-
Judea
and
169509	all
169511	the
169513	region around
169515	the
Jordan
and
were being baptized
169520	in
169522	the
Jordan
River
169526	by
him
confessing
169530	the
169532	sins
of them
Having seen
now
169538	many
169540	of the
Pharisees
and
Sadducees
coming
169546	to
169548	the
baptism
he said
to them
169553	Brood
of vipers
who
forewarned
you
to flee
169560	from
169562	the
169564	coming
wrath
Produce
therefore
169569	fruit
169571	worthy
169573	-
of repentance
And
not
presume
to say
169580	within
yourselves
[As] father
we have
169585	-
Abraham
I say
for
to you
that
able is
169593	-
God
169596	out of
169599	the
stones
these
to raise up
children
169605	unto
Abraham
Already
now
169610	the
ax
169613	to
169615	the
169617	root
169619	of the
trees
is applied
169623	every
therefore
169626	tree
not
producing
169630	fruit
good
is cut down
and
169635	into
[the] fire
is thrown
I
indeed
you
baptize
169643	with
water
169646	to
repentance
-
but
169651	after
me
is coming
mightier
than I
He
of whom
not
I am
fit
169662	the
sandals
to carry
He
you
will baptize
169669	with
169671	[the] Spirit
Holy
and
with fire
169676	whose
169678	-
winnowing fork [is]
169681	in
169683	the
169685	hand
of Him
and
He will clear
169690	the
169692	threshing floor
of Him
and
will gather
169697	the
169699	wheat
of Him
169702	into
169704	the
barn
169707	the
but
chaff
He will burn up
169712	with fire
unquenchable
Then
comes
169717	-
Jesus
169720	from
169722	-
Galilee
169725	to
169727	the
Jordan
169730	unto
169732	-
John
-
to be baptized
169737	by
him
-
But
was hindering
Him
saying
I
need
have
169748	by
You
to be baptized
and
You
come
169755	to
me
Answering
however
169760	-
Jesus
said
him
Permit [it]
presently
thus
for
fitting
it is
to us
to fulfill
169773	all
righteousness
Then
he permits
Him
Having been baptized
now
169781	-
Jesus
immediately
went up
169786	from
169788	the
water
and
behold
were opened
169794	the
heavens
and
he saw
169799	Spirit
God
descending
169803	as
a dove
alighting
169807	upon
Him
And
behold
a voice
169813	out
169815	of the
heavens
saying
This
is
169821	the
169823	Son
of me
169826	the
beloved
169829	in
whom
I was well pleased
Then
169834	-
Jesus
was led up
169838	into
169840	the
wilderness
169843	by
169845	the
Spirit
to be tempted
169849	by
169851	the
devil
And
having fasted
169856	days
forty
and
169860	forty
nights
afterward
He was hungry
And
having come
the
[one] tempting
he said
to Him
If
169872	Son
You are
169875	-
of God
speak
that
169881	the
stones
these
loaves of bread
might become
-
But
answering
He said
It has been written
Not
169893	by
169895	bread
alone
shall live
169899	the
man
but
169903	by
169905	every
169907	word
coming out
169910	of
169912	[the] mouth
of God
Then
takes
Him
169918	the
devil
169921	to
169923	the
169925	holy
city
and
sets
Him
169931	upon
169933	the
169935	pinnacle
169937	of the
temple
and
says
to him
If
169944	Son
You are
169947	-
of God
throw
Yourself
down
it has been written
for
-
169956	To the
169958	angels
of Him
He will give orders
169962	concerning
You
and
169966	in
[their] hands
will they bear up
You
lest
ever
You strike
169974	against
a stone
169977	the
169979	foot
of You
Said
to him
169984	-
Jesus
Again
it has been written
Not
you shall test
[the] Lord
169992	the
169994	God
of you
Again
takes
Him
170000	the
devil
170003	to
170005	a mountain
170007	high
exceedingly
and
shows
to Him
170013	all
170015	the
170017	kingdoms
170019	of the
world
and
170023	the
170025	glory
of them
and
he says
to Him
170031	These things
to You
all
will I give
if
falling down
You will worship
me
Then
says
to him
170043	-
Jesus
Get you away
Satan
it has been written
for
[The] Lord
170051	the
170053	God
of you
you shall worship
and
170058	Him
alone
shall you serve
Then
leaves
Him
170065	the
devil
and
behold
angels
came
and
were ministering
to Him
Having heard
now
that
John
had been delivered up
He withdrew
170081	into
170083	-
Galilee
And
having left
170088	-
Nazareth
having come
he dwelt
170093	at
Capernaum
170097	which
[is] on the sea-side
170100	in
170102	[the] region
of Zebulun
and
Naphtali
that
it might be fulfilled
that
having been spoken
170111	by
Isaiah
170114	the
prophet
saying
170120	Land
of Zebulun
and
170124	land
of Naphtali
170127	way
of [the] sea

170137	of the
Gentiles
170140	The
people

darkness
170148	a light
have seen
great
and
to those
sitting
170155	in [the]
170157	land
and
shadow
of death
a light
has dawned
on them
170165	From
that time
began
170169	-
Jesus
to proclaim
and
to say
Repent
has drawn near
for
170178	the
170180	kingdom
170182	of the
heavens
Walking
now
170187	beside
170189	the
170191	Sea
170193	-
of Galilee
He saw
170197	two
brothers
Simon
-
called
Peter
and
Andrew
170206	the
170208	brother
of him
casting
a net
170213	into
170215	the
sea
they were
for
fishermen
And
He says
to them
Come follow
170225	after
Me
and
I will make
you
170231	fishers
of men
-
And
immediately
having left
170238	the
nets
they followed
Him
And
having gone on
from there
He saw
170247	others
170249	two
brothers
James
170253	the [son]
170255	-
of Zebedee
and
John
170260	the
170262	brother
of him
170265	in
170267	the
boat
170270	with
Zebedee
170273	the
170275	father
of them
mending
170279	the
170281	nets
of them
and
He called
them
-
And
immediately
having left
170291	the
boat
and
170295	the
170297	father
of them
they followed
Him
And
He was going
170304	throughout
170306	all

Galilee

170312	in
170314	the
170316	synagogues
of them
and
proclaiming
170321	the
170323	gospel
170325	of the
kingdom
and
healing
170330	every
disease
and
170334	every
sickness
170337	among
170339	the
people
And
went out
170344	the
170346	news
of Him
170349	into
170351	all
170353	-
Syria
And
they brought
to Him
170359	all
the
sick
having
170364	various
diseases
and
pains
oppressing
being possessed by demons
and
being epileptics
and
paralytics
and
He healed
them
And
followed
Him
170382	crowds
great
170385	from
170387	-
Galilee
and
[the] Decapolis
and
Jerusalem
and
Judea
and
170397	beyond
170399	the
Jordan
Having seen
then
170404	the
crowds
He went up
170408	on
170410	the
mountain
and
having sat down
of Him
came
to Him
170418	the
170420	disciples
of Him
And
opening
170425	the
170427	mouth
of Him
He was teaching
them
saying
Blessed [are]
170434	the
170436	poor
170438	in the
spirit
for
theirs
is
170444	the
170446	kingdom
170448	of the
heavens
Blessed [are]
those
mourning
for
they
will be comforted
Blessed
170458	the
meek
for
they
will inherit
170464	the
earth
Blessed [are]
those
hungering
and
thirsting for
170472	-
righteousness
for
they
will be filled
Blessed [are]
170479	the
merciful
for
they
will receive mercy
Blessed
170486	the
170488	pure
170490	-
in heart
for
they
170495	-
God
will see
Blessed
170500	the
peacemakers
for
they
170505	sons
of God
will be called
Blessed [are]
those
having been persecuted
170512	on account of
righteousness
for
theirs
is
170518	the
170520	kingdom
170522	of the

Blessed
are you
when
they shall insult
you
and
shall persecute [you]
and
shall say
170534	all kinds of
evil
170537	against
you
lying
170541	on account of
Me
Rejoice
and
exult
for
170548	the
170550	reward
of you
[is] great
170554	in
170556	the
heavens
thus
for
they persecuted
170562	the
prophets
170565	-
170567	before
you
You
are
170572	the
170574	salt
170576	of the
earth
if
however
170581	the
salt
becomes tasteless
170585	with
what
will it be salted
170589	For
nothing
it is potent
any longer
if
not
having been cast
out
to be trampled upon
170599	by
170601	-
men
You
are
170606	the
170608	light
170610	of the
world
Not
is able
a city
to be hidden
170617	on
a hill
lying
Nor
do they light
a lamp
and
put
it
170627	under
170629	-
a basket
but
170633	upon
170635	the
lampstand
and
it shines
170640	for all
170642	those
170644	in
170646	the
house
Thus
let shine
170651	the
170653	light
of you
170656	before
170658	-
men
so that
they may see
170663	your
170665	-
170667	good
works
and
they should glorify
170672	the
170674	Father
of you
170677	-
170679	in
170681	the
heavens
Not
think
that
I have come
to abolish
170689	the
law
or
170693	the
Prophets
not
I have come
to abolish
but
to fulfill
Truly
for
I say
to you
until
-
shall pass away
170708	the
heaven
and
170712	the
earth
170715	iota
one
or
170719	one
stroke of a letter
170722	no
not
shall pass away
170726	from
170728	the
law
until
-
everything
should happen
Whoever
if
then
shall break
170739	one
170743	of the
commandments
of these
170747	the
least
and
shall teach
so
170753	the
others
least
he will be called
170758	in
170760	the
170762	kingdom
170764	of the
heavens
whoever
now
-
shall keep
and
shall teach [them]
this [one]
great
will be called
170776	in
170778	the
170780	kingdom
170782	of the
heavens
I say
for
to you
that
if
not
shall abound
170792	your
170794	-
righteousness
above [that]
170798	of the
scribes
and
Pharisees
170803	no
not
shall you enter
170807	into
170809	the
170811	kingdom
170813	of the
heavens
You have heard
that
it was said
170819	to the
ancients
Not
you shall murder
whoever
now
-
shall murder
liable
will be
170830	to the
judgment
I
however
say
to you
that
170838	everyone
-
being angry with
170842	the
170844	brother
of him
liable
will be
170849	to the
judgment
whoever
now
-
shall say
170856	to
170858	brother
of him
Raca
liable
will be
170864	to the
Sanhedrin
whoever
now
-
shall say
Fool
liable
will be
170874	to
170876	the
170878	hell
170880	-
of fire
If
therefore
you shall offer
170886	the
170888	gift
of you
170891	at
170893	the
altar
and there
shall remember
that
170899	the
170901	brother
of you
has
something
170906	against
you
leave
there
170911	the
170913	gift
of you
170916	before
170918	the
altar
and
go away
first
be reconciled
170925	to
170927	brother
of you
and
then
having come
offer
170934	the
170936	gift
of you
170939	Be
agreeing
170942	with
170944	accuser
of you
quickly
170948	while
which
you are
170952	with
him
170955	on
170957	the
way
lest
ever
you
deliver
170964	the
accuser
170967	to the
judge
and
170971	the
judge
170974	to the
officer
and
170978	into
prison
you will be cast
Truly
I say
to you
170985	no
not
shall you come out
from there
until
-
you should pay
170993	the
170995	last
kodranten
You have heard
that
it was said
Not
shall you commit adultery
I
however
say
to you
that
171008	everyone
-
looking upon
a woman
171013	in order
-
to lust after
her
already
has committed adultery with
her
171021	in
171023	the
171025	heart
of him
If
now
171030	the
171033	eye
of you
171036	-
right
causes to stumble
you
pluck out
it
and
cast [it]
171045	from
you
it is better
indeed
for you
that
should perish
171053	one
171055	of the
171057	members
of you
and
not
171062	all
171064	the
171066	body
of you
should be cast
171070	into
hell
And
if
171075	the
171077	right
171079	of you
hand
causes to stumble
you
cut off
it
and
cast [it]
171088	from
you
it is better
indeed
for you
that
should perish
171096	one
171098	of the
171100	members
of you
and
not
171105	all
171107	the
171109	body
of you
171112	into
hell
should depart
It was said
also
Whoever
-
shall divorce
171121	the
171123	wife
of him
let him give
to her
a letter of divorce
I
however
say
to you
that
171134	everyone
-
divorcing
171138	the
171140	wife
of him
171143	except
171145	on account
of sexual immorality
causes
her
to commit adultery
And
whoever
if
her having been divorced
shall marry
commits adultery
Again
you have heard
that
it was said
171161	to the
ancients
Not
shall you swear falsely
you shall keep
now
171168	to the
Lord
171171	the
171173	oaths
of you
I
however
say
to you
not
to swear
at all
neither
171184	by
171186	-
heaven
because
171190	[the] throne
it is
171193	-
of God
nor
171197	by
171199	the
earth
because
171203	[the] footstool
it is
171206	of the
171208	feet
of Him
nor
171212	by
Jerusalem
because
171216	[the] city
it is
171219	of the
171221	great
King
Neither
171225	by
171227	the
171229	head
of you
shall you swear
because
not
you are able
171236	one
hair
white
to make
or
black
Let it be
however
171245	the
171247	statement
of you
Yes
âYes
[and] âNo
No
171254	The
however
171257	more than
these
171260	from
171262	-
evil
comes
You have heard
that
it was said
Eye
171270	for
eye
and
tooth
171275	for
tooth
I
however
say
to you
not
to resist
171284	the
evil [person]
Instead
whoever
you
shall strike
171291	on
171293	the
171296	right
cheek
of you
turn
to him
171302	also
171304	the
other
and
to the one
willing
you
to sue
and
171313	the
171315	tunic
of you
to take
yield
to him
171321	also
171323	the
cloak
and
whoever
you
shall compel to go
171330	mile
one
go
171334	with
him
two
To the [one]
asking of
you
give
and
the [one]
desiring
171345	from
you
to borrow
not
you shall turn away from
You have heard
that
it was said
You shall love
171355	-
171357	neighbor
of you
and
shall hate
171362	-
171364	enemy
of you
I
however
say
to you
love
171372	the
171374	enemies
of you
and
pray
171379	for
those
persecuting
you
so that
you may be
171386	sons
171388	of the
171390	Father
of you
171393	who is
171395	in
[the] heavens
For
171399	the
171401	sun
of Him
He makes rise
171405	on
evil
and
good
and
He sends rain
171412	on
righteous
and
unrighteous
If
for
you love
those
loving
you
171423	what
reward
have you
Do not
171428	also
171430	the
tax collectors
171433	the
same
do
And
if
you greet
171440	the
171442	brothers
of you
only
171446	what
extraordinary
do you
Do not
171451	also
171453	the
Gentiles
171456	the
same
do
Shall be
therefore
you
perfect
as
171465	the
171468	Father
of you
171471	who [is]
Heavenly
perfect
is
Beware
now
171478	the
171480	righteousness
of you
not
to do
171485	before
171487	-
men
171490	in order
-
to be seen
by them
if
now
otherwise
reward
not
have you
171501	with
171503	the
171505	Father
of you
171508	who [is]
171510	in
171512	the
heavens
When
therefore
you do
acts of charity
not
do sound a trumpet
171521	before
you
as
171525	the
hypocrites
do
171529	in
171531	the
synagogues
and
171535	in
171537	the
streets
so that
they may have glory
171542	from
171544	-
men
Truly
I say
to you
they have
171551	the
171553	reward
of them
You
however
doing
charity
not
let know
171562	the
171564	left [hand]
of you
what
is doing
171569	the
171571	right hand
of you
so that
may be
171576	your
171578	-
giving
171581	in
171583	-
secret
And
171587	the
171589	Father
of you
the [One]
seeing
171594	in
171596	-
secret
will reward
you
And
when
you pray
not
you shall be
171606	like
171608	the
hypocrites
for
they love
171613	in
171615	the
synagogues
and
171619	on
171621	the
171623	corners
171625	of the
streets
standing
to pray
so that
they might be seen
171632	-
by men
Truly
I say
to you
they have
171639	the
171641	reward
of them
You
however
when
you pray
enter
171649	into
171651	the
171653	room
of you
and
having shut
171658	the
171660	door
of you
pray
171664	to
171666	Father
of you
171669	the [One]
171671	in
171673	-
secret
And
171677	the
171679	Father
of you
the [One]
seeing
171684	in
171686	-
secret
will reward
you
Praying
now
not
do use vain repetitions
like
171696	the
pagans
they think
for
that
171702	in
171704	the
171706	many words
of them
they will be heard
Not
therefore
be like
to them
knows
for
171716	the
171718	Father
of you
171721	of what things
need
you have
171725	before
-
your
asking
Him
Thus
therefore
pray
you
171735	Father
of us
171738	who [is]
171740	in
171742	the
heavens
hallowed be
171746	the
171748	name
of You
Come
171752	the
171754	kingdom
of You
be done
171758	the
171760	will
of You
171763	as
171765	in
heaven
171768	[so] also
171770	upon
earth
171773	The
171776	bread
of us
171779	-
daily
grant
us
today
And
forgive
us
171788	the
171790	debts
of us
as
171794	also
we
forgive
171798	the
171800	debtors
of us
And
not
lead
us
171807	into
temptation
but
deliver
us
171813	from
171815	-
evil
If
for
you forgive
171821	-
men
171824	the
171826	trespasses
of them
will forgive
171830	also
you
171833	the
171836	Father
of you
171839	-
Heavenly
If
however
not
you forgive
171846	-
men
neither
171850	the
171852	Father
of you
will forgive
171856	the
171858	trespasses
of you
Whenever
now
you fast
not
be
like
171867	the
hypocrites
gloomy
they disfigure
for
171873	the
171875	appearance
of them
so that
they might appear
171880	-
to men
[as] fasting
Truly
I say
to you
they have
171888	the
171890	reward
of them
You
however
fasting
anoint
171897	your
171899	-
head
and
171903	the
171905	face
of you
wash
so that
not
you might appear
171912	-
to men
[as] fasting
but
171917	-
171919	to Father
your
171922	the [One]
171924	in
171926	-
secret
and
171930	the
171932	Father
of you
the [One]
seeing
171937	in
171939	-
secret
will reward
you
Not
store up
for yourselves
treasures
171948	upon
171950	the
earth
where
moth
and
rust
destroy
and
where
thieves
break in
and
steal
store up
however
for yourselves
treasures
171968	in
heaven
where
neither
moth
nor
rust
destroy
and
where
thieves
not
do break in
nor
steal
Where
for
is
171987	the
171989	treasure
of you
there
will be
171994	also
171996	the
171998	heart
of you
172001	The
172003	lamp
172005	of the
body
is
172009	the
eye
If
therefore
is
172015	the
172017	eye
of you
clear
172021	[the] whole
172023	-
172025	body
of you
full of light
will be
If
however
172032	the
172034	eye
of you
evil
is
172039	all
172041	the
172043	body
of you
full of darkness
will be
If
then
172050	the
light
172053	that [is]
172055	within
you
darkness
is
172060	that
darkness
how great
No one
is able
172066	two
masters
to serve
either
for
172072	the
one
he will hate
and
172077	the
other
he will love
or
[the] one
he will be devoted to
and
172085	the
other
he will despise
Not
you are able
God
to serve
and
money
172095	Because of
this
I say
to you
not
be anxious about
172102	the
172104	life
of you
what
you should eat
or
what
you should drink
nor
172113	the
172115	body
of you
what
you should put on
Not
172121	the
life
more
is
172126	than the
food
and
172130	the
body
172133	than
clothing
Look
172137	at
172139	the
172141	birds
172143	of the
air
that
not
they sow
nor
do they reap
nor
do they gather
172153	into
barns
and
172157	the
172160	Father
of you
172163	-
Heavenly
feeds
them
Not
you
much
are more valuable
than they
172173	Who
now
172176	from
you
being anxious
is able
to add
172182	to
172184	the
172186	lifespan
of him
172189	hour
one
And
172193	about
clothing
why
are you anxious
Observe
172199	the
172201	lilies
172203	of the
field
how
they grow
[They do] not
labor
nor
do they spin
I say
however
to you
that
not even
Solomon
172218	in
172220	all
172222	the
172224	glory
of him
was adorned
like
172229	one
of these
If
however
172234	the
172236	grass
172238	of the
field
today
being [here]
and
tomorrow
172245	into
the furnace
being thrown
172249	-
God
thus
clothes
[will He] not
172255	much
more
you
O [you] of little faith
Not
therefore
be anxious
saying
What
shall we eat
Or
what
shall we drink
Or
what
shall we wear
172272	All
for
these things
172276	the
Gentiles
seek after
knows
for
172282	the
172285	Father
of you
172288	-
Heavenly
that
you have need
172293	of them
all
Seek
however
first
172299	the
kingdom
and
172303	the
172305	righteousness
of Him
and
172309	these things
all
will be added
to you
Not
therefore
be anxious
172317	about
172319	things
tomorrow
172322	-
for
tomorrow
will be anxious about
itself
Sufficient
172329	to the
day [is]
172332	the
172334	trouble
of it
Not
do judge
that
not
you should be judged
172342	With
172344	whatever
for
verdict
you judge
you will be judged
and
172351	with
172353	whatever
measure
you measure
it will be measured again
to you
Why
now
do you look at
172362	the
splinter
172365	that [is]
172367	in
172369	the
172371	eye
172373	the
172375	brother
of you
172378	-
and
172382	the in
172384	-
172386	your [own]
eye
beam
not
notice
Or
how
shall you say
172395	to the
172397	brother
of you
Permit that
I might cast out
172402	the
splinter
172405	from
172407	the
172409	eye
of you
and
behold
172414	the
beam
172417	[is] in
172419	the
172421	eye
of you
Hypocrite
Cast out
first
172427	from
172429	the
172431	eye
of you
172434	the
beam
and
then
you will see clearly
to cast out
172441	the
splinter
172444	from
172446	the
172448	eye
172450	of the
172452	brother
of you
Not
give
172457	that which [is]
holy
172460	to the
dogs
nor
cast
172465	the
172467	pearls
of you
172470	before
172472	the
pigs
not
lest
they shall trample upon
them
172479	with
172481	the
172483	feet
of them
and
having turned
they tear to pieces
you
Ask
and
it will be given
to you
seek
and
you will find
knock
and
it will be opened
to you
172501	Everyone
for
-
asking
receives
and
the [one]
seeking
finds
and
to the [one]
knocking
it will be opened
Or
172516	which
is
172519	of
you
a man
whom
will ask for
172525	the
172527	son
of him
bread
not
a stone
will he give
him
Or
172536	also
a fish
he will ask for
not
a serpent
will he give
him
If
therefore
you
evil
being
know
172550	gifts
good
to give
172554	to the
172556	children
of you
172559	how much
more
172562	the
172564	Father
of you
172567	who [is]
172569	in
172571	the
heavens
will give
good things
to those
asking
Him
172579	All things
therefore
as many as
if
you might desire
that
should do
to you
172588	the
men
so
172592	also
you
do
to them
This
for
is
172600	the
law
and
172604	the
prophets
Enter
172608	through
172610	the
172612	narrow
gate
For
wide [is]
172617	the
gate
and
broad
172622	the
way
-
leading
172627	to
172629	-
destruction
and
many
are
those
entering
172637	through
it
For
small [is]
172642	the
gate
and
compressed
172647	the
way
-
leading
172652	to
172654	-
life
and
few
are
those
finding
it
But beware
172664	of
172666	the
false prophets
who
come
172671	to
you
172674	in
172676	clothing
of sheep
inwardly
however
they are
172682	wolves
ravenous
172685	By
172687	the
172689	fruits
of them
you will know
them
Not
do they gather
172696	from
thorns
grapes
or
172701	from
thistles
figs
So
172706	every
172708	tree
good
172711	fruits
good
produces
172715	-
but
172718	the bad
tree
172721	fruits
bad
produces
Not
is able
172727	a tree
good
172730	fruits
bad
to produce
nor
172735	a tree
bad
172738	fruits
good
to produce
172742	Every
172744	tree
not
producing
172748	fruit
good
is cut down
and
172753	into
fire
is thrown
Then surely
172758	by
172760	the
172762	fruits
of them
you will know
them
Not
172768	everyone
-
saying
to Me
Lord
Lord
will enter
172776	into
172778	the
172780	kingdom
172782	of the
heavens
but
the [one]
doing
172788	the
172790	will
172792	the
172794	Father
of Me
172797	who [is]
172799	in
172801	the
heavens
Many
will say
to Me
172807	in
172809	that
172811	the
day
Lord
Lord
not
172817	in
172819	Your
name
did we prophesy
and
172824	[in]
172826	Your
name
demons
cast out
and
172832	[in]
172834	your
name
172837	miracles
many
perform
And
then
I will declare
to them
-
Never
knew I
you
depart you
172850	from
Me
those
working
172855	-
lawlessness
172858	Everyone
therefore
whoever
hears
172863	My
172866	-
words
these
and
does
them
will be like
172874	a man
wise
who
built
172879	his
172881	-
house
172884	upon
172886	the
rock
And
came down
172891	the
rain
and
came
172896	the
torrents
and
blew
172901	the
winds
and
beat
172907	that
house
upon
and
not
it fell
it had been founded
for
172916	upon
172918	the
rock
And
172922	everyone
-
hearing
172926	My
172929	-
words
these
and
not
doing
them
he will be likened
172938	to a man
foolish
who
built
172943	of him
172945	the
house
172948	upon
172950	the
sand
And
came down
172955	the
rain
and
came
172960	the
torrents
and
blew
172965	the
winds
and
beat
172971	that
house
upon
and
it fell
and
was
172979	the
172981	fall
of it
great
And
it came to pass
when
had finished
172989	-
Jesus
172993	the
words
these
were astonished
172998	the
crowds
173001	at
173003	the
173005	teaching
of Him
173008	He was
for
teaching
them
as
authority
having
and
not
as
173019	the
173021	scribes
of them
Having come down
now
He
173027	from
173029	the
mountain
followed
Him
173034	crowds
great
And
behold
a leper
having come
was worshipping
Him
saying
Lord
if
You are willing
You are able
me
to cleanse
And
having stretched out
173052	the
hand
He touched
him
saying
I am willing
be you cleansed
And
immediately
was cleansed
173063	his
173065	-
leprosy
And
says
to him
173071	-
Jesus
See that
no one
you tell
But
go
yourself
show
173081	to the
priest
and
offer
173086	the
gift
that
commanded
Moses
173092	for
173094	a testimony
to them
Having entered
now
He
173100	into
Capernaum
came
to Him
a centurion
imploring
Him
and
saying
Lord
173111	the
173113	servant
of me
is lying
173117	in
173119	the
house
paralyzed
grievously
tormented
He says
to him
I
having come
will heal
him
Answering
however
173133	the
centurion
said
Lord
not
I am
worthy
that
173143	of me
under
173146	the
roof
You should come
but
only
speak
the word
and
will be healed
173156	the
173158	servant
of me
173161	Also
for
I
173166	a man
am
173169	under
authority
having
173173	under
me
soldiers
and
I say
to this [one]
Go
and
he goes
and
to another
Come
and
he comes
and
173189	to
173191	[the] servant
of me
Do
this
and
he does [it]
Having heard
now
173200	-
Jesus
marveled
and
said
to those
following
Truly
I say
to you
173211	except
no one
173214	so great
faith
173217	in
173219	-
Israel
have I found
I say
now
to you
that
many
173228	from
east
and
west
will come
and
will recline
173236	with
Abraham
and
Isaac
and
Jacob
173243	in
173245	the
173247	kingdom
173249	of the
heavens
173252	the
however
173255	sons
173257	of the
kingdom
will be cast out
173261	into
173263	the
173265	darkness
173267	the
outer
there
will be
173272	the
weeping
and
173276	the
173278	gnashing
173280	of the
teeth
And
said
173285	-
Jesus
173288	to the
centurion
Go
as
you have believed
be it
to you
And
was healed
173298	the
servant
173301	in
173304	the
hour
that
And
having come
173310	-
Jesus
173313	to
173315	the
173317	house
of Peter
He saw
173321	the
173323	mother-in-law
of him
lying sick
and
fevering
And
He touched
173331	the
173333	hand
of her
and
left
her
173339	the
fever
and
she arose
and
was ministering
to them
Evening
now
having come
they brought
to Him
173352	being possessed with demons
many
and
He cast out
173357	the
spirits
by a word
and
173362	all
those
sick
being
He healed
so that
it might be fulfilled
that
having been spoken
173372	by
Isaiah
173375	the
prophet
saying
Himself
173380	the
173382	infirmities
of us
He took
and
173387	our
diseases
bore
Having seen
now
173393	-
Jesus
crowd
173397	around
Him
He commanded
to depart
173402	to
173404	the
other side
And
having come to [him]
173409	one
scribe
said
to Him
Teacher
I will follow
You
wherever
if
You might go
And
says
to him
173423	-
Jesus
173426	-
Foxes
holes
have
and
173432	the
173434	birds
173436	of the
air
nests
173440	-
but
173443	the Son
173445	-
of Man
no
has
[place] where
173451	the
head
He might lay
173455	Another
now
173458	of the
disciples
said
to Him
Lord
allow
me
first
to go
and
to bury
173470	the
173472	father
of me
173475	-
But
Jesus
said
to him
Follow
Me
and
leave
173485	the
dead
to bury
173489	-
173491	their own
dead
And
having entered
He
173497	into
173499	the
boat
followed
Him
173504	the
173506	disciples
of Him
And
behold
173511	a storm
great
arose
173515	in
173517	the
sea
so that
173521	the
boat
was being swamped
173525	by
173527	the
waves
He Himself
however
was sleeping
And
having come to [Him]
they awoke
Him
saying
Lord
save us
we are perishing
And
He says
to them
Why
fearful
are you
O [you] of little faith
Then
having arisen
He rebuked
173551	the
winds
and
173555	the
sea
and
there was
173560	a calm
great
173563	-
And
the men
marveled
saying
What kind [of man]
is
this
that
even
173574	the
winds
and
173578	the
sea
Him
obey
And
having come
He
173586	to
173588	the
other side
173591	to
173593	the
173595	region
173597	of the
Gadarenes
met
Him
173602	two
173605	being possessed by demons
173607	out of
173609	the
tombs
coming forth
173613	violent
extremely
so that
not
was able
anyone
to pass
173621	by
173624	the
way
that
And
behold
they cried out
saying
What
to us
and
to you
173636	Son
173638	-
of God
Are You come
here
173643	before [the]
time
to torment
us
There was
now
far off
173651	from
them
173655	a herd
173657	of pigs
many
feeding
173661	-
And
the demons
were begging
Him
saying
If
You cast out
us
send away
us
173673	into
173675	the
173677	herd
173679	-
of pigs
And
He said
to them
Go
-
And
having gone out
they went away
173690	into
173692	the
pigs
and
behold
rushed
173698	all
173700	the
herd
173703	down
173705	the
steep bank
173708	into
173710	the
sea
and
perished
173715	in
173717	the
waters
Those
now
feeding [them]
fled
and
having gone away
173726	into
173728	the
city
they related
everything
including
173734	the [matter]
of those
being possessed by demons
And
behold
173740	all
173742	the
city
went out
173746	to
173748	meet
173750	-
Jesus
And
having seen
Him
they begged [Him]
that
He would depart
173759	from
173761	the
173763	region
of them
And
having entered
173768	into
a boat
He passed over
and
came
173774	to
173776	the
173778	own
city
And
behold
they were bringing
to Him
173785	a paralytic
173787	on
a bed
lying
And
having seen
173793	-
Jesus
173796	the
173798	faith
of them
He said
173802	to the
paralytic
Take courage
son
have been forgiven
173808	of you
173810	the
sins
And
behold
173815	some
173817	of the
scribes
said
173821	to
themselves
This [man]
blasphemes
And
having known
173828	-
Jesus
173831	the
173833	thoughts
of them
He said
173837	So that
why
think you
evil
173842	in
173844	the
173846	hearts
of you
Which
for
is
easier
to say
Are forgiven
173855	of you
173857	the
sins
or
to say
Arise
and
walk
So that
however
you may know
that
authority
has
173871	the
173873	Son
173875	-
of Man
173878	on
173880	the
earth
to forgive
sins
Then
He says
173887	to the
paralytic
Having arisen
take up
173892	your
173894	-
mat
and
go
173899	to
173901	the
173903	house
of you
And
having arisen
he went away
173909	to
173911	the
173913	house
of him
Having seen
now
173918	the
crowds
marveled
and
glorified
173924	-
God
the [One]
having given
173929	authority
such
173932	-
to men
And
passing on
173937	-
Jesus
from there
He saw
173943	a man
sitting
173946	at
173948	the
tax booth
Matthew
named
And
He says
to him
Follow
Me
And
having arisen
he followed
Him
And
it came to pass
of Him
reclining
173966	in
173968	the
house
that
behold
173973	many
tax collectors
and
sinners
having come
were reclining with
173980	-
Jesus
and
173984	the
173986	disciples
of Him
And
having seen [it]
173991	the
Pharisees
said
173995	to
173997	disciples
of Him
174000	Because of
why
174003	with
174005	the
tax collectors
and
sinners
eats
174011	the
174013	Teacher
of you
-
And
having heard
He said
Not
174021	need
have
those
being strong
of a physician
but
those
sick
being
Having gone
however
learn
what
is
Mercy
I desire
and
not
sacrifice
Not
for
I came
to call
[the] righteous
but
sinners
Then
come
to Him
174051	the
174053	disciples
of John
saying
174057	Because of
why
we
and
174062	the
Pharisees
do fast
174066	the
however
174069	disciples
of You
not
fast
And
said
to them
174077	-
Jesus
Not
can
174082	the
174084	sons
174086	of the
bridechamber
mourn
174090	as
long as
174093	with
them
is
174097	the
bridegroom
Will come
however
days
when
shall have been taken away
174105	from
them
174108	the
bridegroom
and
then
they will fast
No one
however
puts
174117	a patch
174119	of cloth
unshrunk
174122	on
174124	clothing
old
tears away
for
174129	the
174131	patch
of it
174134	from
174136	the
garment
and
174140	a worse
tear
emerges
Nor
pour they
174146	wine
new
174149	into
174151	wineskins
old
if
now
lest
are burst
174158	the
wineskins
and
174162	the
wine
is poured out
and
174167	the
wineskins
are destroyed
But
they pour
174173	wine
new
174176	into
174178	wineskins
new
and
both
are preserved
These things
of Him
speaking
to them
behold
174189	a ruler
certain
having come
was kneeling down
to Him
saying
-
174197	The
174199	daughter
of Me
presently
has died
but
having come
lay
174207	the
174209	hand
of You
174212	upon
her
and
she will live
And
having arisen
174219	-
Jesus
followed
him
also
174225	the
174227	disciples
of Him
And
behold
174232	a woman
having had a flux of blood
174235	twelve
years
having come up
behind [Him]
touched
174241	the
174243	fringe
174245	of the
174247	garment
of Him
She was saying
for
174252	within
herself
If
only
I shall touch
174258	the
174260	garment
of Him
I will be healed
174264	-
And
Jesus
having turned
and
having seen
her
said
Take courage
daughter
174275	the
174277	faith
of you
has cured
you
And
was cured
174284	the
woman
174287	from
174290	the
hour
very
And
having come
174296	-
Jesus
174299	into
174301	the
174303	house
174305	of the
ruler
and
having seen
174310	the
flute players
and
174314	the
crowd
making a commotion
He says
Go away
Not
for
is dead
174323	the
girl
but
sleeps
And
they began to laugh at
Him
When
now
had been put outside
174334	the
crowd
having entered
He took hold of
174339	the
174341	hand
of her
and
arose
174346	the
girl
And
went out
174352	the
report
this
174356	into
174359	all
174361	the
land
that
And
passing on
from there
174368	-
Jesus
followed
174372	two
blind [men]
crying out
and
saying
Have mercy on
us
174380	Son
of David
Having come
now
174385	into
174387	the
house
came
to Him
174392	the
blind [men]
and
says
to them
174398	-
Jesus
Believe you
that
I am able
this
to do
They say
to him
Yes
Lord
Then
He touched
174412	the
174414	eyes
of them
saying
174418	According to
174420	the
174422	faith
of you
be it
to you
And
were opened
174429	their
174431	-
eyes
And
strictly instructed
them
174437	-
Jesus
saying
See that
no one
knows
-
But
having gone out
they make known
Him
174449	in
174452	all
174454	the
land
that
[As] they
now
were going out
behold
they brought
to Him
174464	mute
possessed by a demon
And
having been cast out
174469	the
demon
spoke
174473	the
mute [man]
And
marveled
174478	the
crowds
saying
Never
was it seen
thus
174485	in
174487	-
Israel
174490	The
now
Pharisees
were saying
174495	By
174497	the
174499	prince
174501	of the
demons
He casts out
174505	-
demons
And
was going throughout
174510	-
Jesus
174514	the
cities
all
and
174519	the
villages
teaching
174523	in
174525	the
174527	synagogues
of them
and
proclaiming
174532	the
174534	gospel
174536	of the
kingdom
and
healing
174541	every
disease
and
174545	every
sickness
Having seen
now
174550	the
crowds
He was moved with compassion
174554	for
them
because
174558	they were
wearied
and
cast away
as
174564	sheep
not
having
a shepherd
Then
He says
174571	to the
174573	disciples
of Him
174576	The
indeed
harvest
[is] plentiful
174581	the
however
workmen
[are] few
Beseech
therefore
174588	the
174590	Lord
174592	of the
harvest
that
He might send out
workmen
174598	into
174600	the
174602	harvest
of Him
And
having summoned
174607	the
174609	twelve
174611	disciples
of Him
He gave
to them
174616	authority
174618	over spirits
unclean
so as
to cast out
them
and
to heal
174626	every
disease
and
174630	every
sickness

Going on

therefore
shrewd
as
174938	the

innocent
as

Beware
however
174949	of
174951	-
men
they will deliver
for
you
174957	into
courts

174961	in
174963	the
174965	synagogues
of them
they will flog
you
174970	and
174972	before

Gentiles
When
then
they deliver up
you

how

what
you should speak
it will be given
for
you
175004	in

teacher
nor
a servant
175126	above
175128	the
175130	master
of him
[It is] sufficient
175134	for the
disciple
that
he become

175163	how much
more

of him
Not
therefore
you should fear

175218	of
those
killing
175222	the
body
175225	the
however
soul
not
being able
to kill
you should fear
however
rather
the [One]
being able
both
soul
and
body
to destroy
175242	in
hell
Not

And
175252	one
175254	of
them
not

will confess
175301	in

of Me

but
a sword
I came
for
to set at variance
A man
175376	against
175378	the
175380	father
of him
and
a daughter
175385	against
175387	the
175389	mother
of her
and
a daughter-in-law
175394	against
175396	the
175398	mother-in-law
of her
And
175402	enemies
175404	of the
man
175407	the
175409	household
of him
The [one]
loving
father
or
mother
175417	above
Me
not
is
of Me
worthy
and
the [one]
loving
son
or
daughter
175430	above
Me
not
is
of Me
worthy
And
he who
not
takes
175441	the
175443	cross
of him
and
follows
175448	after
Me
not
is
of Me
worthy
The [one]
having found
175457	the
175459	life
of him
will lose
it
and
the [one]
having lost
175467	the
175469	life
of him
175472	on account of
Me
will find
it
The [One]
receiving
you
Me
receives
and
the [one]
Me
receiving
receives
the [One]
having sent
Me
The [one]
receiving
a prophet
175493	in [the]
175495	name
of a prophet
175498	[the] reward
of a prophet
will receive
and
the [one]
receiving
a righteous [man]
175506	in [the]
175508	name
of a righteous [man]
175511	the reward
of a righteous [man]
will receive
And
whoever
-
shall give to drink
175519	one
175522	the
little ones
of these
175526	a cup
of cold [water]
only
175530	in [the]
175532	name
of a disciple
truly
I say
to you
175538	no
not
shall he lose
175542	the
175544	reward
of him
And
it came to pass
when
had finished
175551	-
Jesus
commanding
175555	the
175557	twelve
175559	disciples
of Him
He departed
from there
-
to teach
and
to preach
175568	in
175570	the
175572	cities
of them
175575	-
And
John
having heard
175580	in
175582	the
prison
175585	the
175587	works
175589	of the
Christ
having sent
175593	two
175595	of the
175597	disciples
of him
said
to Him
You
are
the
coming [One]
or
another
are we to look for
And
answering
175611	-
Jesus
said
to them
Having gone
relate
to John
what
you hear
and
see
Blind
receive sight
and
lame
walk
lepers
are cleansed
and
deaf
hear
and
dead
are raised
and
poor
are gospelized
And
blessed
is
he who
if
not
shall fall away
175646	in
Me
As these
now
were going away
began
175653	-
Jesus
to speak
175657	to the
crowds
175660	concerning
John
What
went you out
175665	into
175667	the
wilderness
to see
175671	A reed
175673	by [the]
wind
shaken
But
what
did you go out
to see
175681	A man
175683	in
delicate [clothing]
having been dressed
Behold
those
175689	-
delicate [clothing]
wearing
175693	in
175695	the
175697	houses
175699	-
of kings
But
what
did you go out
a prophet
to see
Yes
I say
to you
and [one]
175711	more excellent
than a prophet
For this
is [he]
175716	concerning
whom
it has been written
Behold
I
send
175723	the
175725	messenger
of Me
175728	before
175730	[the] face
of You
who
will prepare
175735	the
175737	way
of You
175740	before
You
Truly
I say
to you
not
there has risen
175748	among [those]
175750	born
of women
175753	one greater
175755	than John
175757	the
Baptist
175760	-
Yet
175763	the least
175765	in
175767	the
175769	kingdom
175771	of the
heavens
greater
than he
is
175777	From
then
175780	the
175782	days
of John
175785	the
Baptist
175788	until
now
175791	the
175793	kingdom
175795	of the
heavens
is taken by violence
and [the]
violent
claim
it
175803	All
for
175806	the
prophets
and
175810	the
law
175813	until
John
prophesied
And
if
you are willing
to receive [it]
he
is
Elijah
the one
being about
to come
The [one]
having
ears
let him hear
To what
however
will I compare
175835	the
generation
this
Like
it is
175841	little children
sitting
175844	in
175846	the
markets
and
calling out
175851	-
to others
saying
We piped
for you
and
not
you did dance
we sang a dirge
and
not
you did wail
Came
for
John
neither
eating
nor
drinking
and
they say
A demon
he has
Came
175876	the
175878	Son
175880	-
of Man
eating
and
drinking
and
they say
Behold
a man
a glutton
and
a drunkard
175893	of tax collectors
a friend
and
of sinners
But
is justified
175900	-
wisdom
175903	by
175905	the
175907	deeds
of her
Then
He began
to denounce
175913	the
cities
175916	in
which
had taken place
175920	the
175922	most
175924	miracles
of Him
because
not
they repented
Woe
to you
Chorazin
Woe
to you
Bethsaida
For
if
175938	in
Tyre
and
Sidon
had taken place
175944	the
miracles
-
having come to pass
175949	in
you
long ago
then
175954	in
sackcloth
and
ashes
they would have repented
But
I say
to you
for Tyre
and
Sidon
more tolerable
will it be
175968	in
175970	[the] day
of judgment
than
for you
And
you
Capernaum
not
175979	to
heaven
will be exalted
175983	to
Hades
will be brought down
For
if
175989	in
Sodom
had taken place
175993	the
miracles
-
having taken place
175998	in
you
it would have remained
-
176003	until
176005	the
day
But
I say
to you
that
176012	for [the] land
of Sodom
more tolerable
will it be
176017	in
176019	day
of judgment
than
for you
176024	At
176026	that
176028	-
time
answering
176032	-
Jesus
said
I fully consent
to You
Father
176039	Lord
176041	of the
heaven
and
176045	the
earth
that
You did hide
these things
176051	from
wise
and
learned
and
did reveal
them
to little children
Yes
176061	-
Father
for
thus
well-pleasing
it was
176068	before
You
All things
to Me
have been delivered
176074	by
176076	the
176078	Father
of Me
And
no one
knows
176084	the
Son
if
not
176089	the
Father
nor
176093	the
Father
anyone
does know
if
not
176100	the
Son
and
to whom
if
might choose
176107	the
Son
to reveal [Him]
Come
176112	to
Me
176115	all
those
toiling
and
being burdened
and I
will give rest
to you
Take
176125	the
176127	yoke
of Me
176130	upon
you
and
learn
176135	from
Me
for
gentle
I am
and
humble
176143	[in] the
heart
and
you will find
rest
176149	[for] the
176151	souls
of you
176154	The
for
176157	yoke
of Me
[is] easy
and
176162	the
176164	burden
of Me
light
is
176169	At
176171	that
176173	-
time
went
176177	-
Jesus
176180	on the
Sabbaths
176183	through
176185	the
grainfields
176188	-
and
176191	the disciples
of Him
were hungry
and
they began
to pluck [the]
heads of grain
and
to eat
176201	-
And
the Pharisees
having seen
said
to Him
Behold
176209	the
176211	disciples
of You
are doing
what
not
it is lawful
to do
176219	on
Sabbath
-
And
He said
to them
Not
you have read
what
did
David
when
he was hungry
and
176234	those
176236	with
him
how
he entered
176241	into
176243	the
176245	house
176247	-
of God
and
176251	the
176253	loaves
176255	of the
presentation
they ate
which
not
176261	lawful
it was
for him
to eat
nor
176267	for those
176269	with
him
if
not
176274	for the
priests
only
Or
not
have you read
176281	in
176283	the
law
that
176287	on the
Sabbath
176290	the
priests
176293	in
176295	the
temple
176298	the
Sabbath
profane
and
guiltless
are
I say
however
to you
that
176310	the
temple
a greater than
is
here
If
however
you had known
what
is
Mercy
I desire
and
not
sacrifice
not
-
you would have condemned
176329	the
guiltless
176332	Lord
for
is
176336	of the
Sabbath
176339	the
176341	Son
176343	of
Man
And
having departed
from there
He went
176350	into
176352	the
176354	synagogue
of them
And
behold
176359	a man
a hand
having
withered
And
they asked
Him
saying
Is
it lawful
176370	on the
Sabbaths
to heal
so that
they might accuse
Him
-
And
He said
to them
What
will there be
176383	among
you
man
who
will have
176389	sheep
one
and
if
falls
it
176396	on the
Sabbaths
176399	into
a pit
not
will he take hold of
it
and
will raise [it] up
How much
therefore
is more valuable
a man
than a sheep
Therefore
it is lawful
176414	on the
Sabbaths
good
to do
Then
He says
176421	to
[the] man
Stretch out
176425	your
176427	-
hand
And
he stretched [it] out
and
it was restored
sound
as
176436	the
other
Having gone out
now
176441	the
Pharisees
a counsel
held
176446	against
Him
how
Him
they might destroy
176452	-
And
Jesus
having known
withdrew
from there
And
followed
Him
great
and
He healed
176465	them
all
and
He warned
them
that
not
known
Him
they should make
so that
might be fulfilled
that
having been spoken
176480	by
Isaiah
176483	the
prophet
saying
Behold
176488	the
176490	servant
of Me
whom
I have chosen
176495	the
176497	beloved
of Me
whom
has found delight
176502	the
176504	soul
of Me
I will put
176508	the
176510	Spirit
of Me
176513	upon
Him
and
justice
176518	to the
Gentiles
He will proclaim
Not
will He quarrel
nor
will he cry out
nor
will hear
anyone
176529	in
176531	the
streets
176534	the
176536	voice
of Him
176539	A reed
bruised
not
He will break
and
176545	a wick
smoldering
not
He will quench
until
-
He leads
176553	to
victory
176556	-
justice
And
176560	in the
176562	name
of Him
[the] Gentiles
will hope
Then
was brought
to Him
176570	[one] possessed by a demon
blind
and
mute
and
He healed
him
in order for
176579	the
mute [man]
to speak
and
to see
And
were amazed
176587	all
176589	the
crowds
and
were saying
Whether
this
is
176597	the
176599	son
of David
176602	-
And
the Pharisees
having heard
said
This [man]
not
casts out
176611	the
demons
if
not
176616	by
176618	-
Beelzebul
176621	prince
176623	of the
demons
Having known
now
176628	the
176630	thoughts
of them
He said
to them
176635	Every
176637	kingdom
having been divided
176640	against
itself
is brought to desolation
and
176645	every
176647	city
or
house
having been divided
176652	against
itself
not
will stand
And
if
176659	-
Satan
176662	-
Satan
casts out
176666	against
himself
he is divided
How
then
will stand
176673	the
176675	kingdom
of him
And
if
I
176681	by
Beelzebul
cast out
176685	-
demons
176688	the
176690	sons
of you
176693	by
whom
do they cast out
176697	On account of
this
they
176701	judges
will be
of you
If
however
176707	by [the]
176709	Spirit
of God
I
cast out
176714	-
demons
then
has come
176719	upon
you
176722	the
176724	kingdom
176726	-
of God
Or
how
is able
anyone
to enter
176734	into
176736	the
176738	house
176740	of the
strong [man]
and
176744	the
176746	goods
of him
to plunder
if
not
first
he bind
176754	the
strong [man]
And
then
176759	the
176761	house
of him
he will plunder
The [one]
not
being
176768	with
Me
176771	against
Me
is
and
the [one]
not
gathering
176779	with
Me
scatters
176783	Because of
this
I say
to you
176788	every
sin
and
blasphemy
will be forgiven
176794	-
men
176797	-
however
176801	against
[the] Spirit
blasphemy
not
will be forgiven
And
whoever
if
speaks
a word
176812	against
176814	the
176816	Son
176818	-
of Man
it will be forgiven
him

now
-
speaks
176827	against
176829	-
176831	Spirit
176833	the
Holy
not
it will be forgiven
him
neither
176840	in
176842	this

age
nor
176848	in

176854	the

good

for

of vipers
how
are you able
good things
to speak

176897	Out of
for
176900	the
176902	abundance
176904	of the

176931	out of
176933	his
176935	evil
treasure
puts forth
evil things
I say
now
to you
that
176944	every
176946	word
careless
that
will speak
176951	-
men
they will give
176955	of
it
an account
176959	in
176961	day
of judgment
176964	By
for
176967	the
176969	words
of you
you will be justified
and
176974	by
176976	the
176978	words
of you
you will be condemned
Then
answered
him
176985	some
176987	of the
scribes
and
Pharisees
saying
Teacher
we wish
176995	from
You
a sign
to see
-
And
answering
He said
to them
177005	A generation
evil
and
adulterous
a sign
seeks for
and
a sign
not
will be given
to it
if
not
177019	the
177021	sign
of Jonah
177024	the
prophet
Just as
for
was
Jonah
177031	in
177033	the
177035	belly
177037	of the
great fish
177040	three
days
and
177044	three
nights
so
will be
177049	the
177051	Son
177053	-
of Man
177056	in
177058	the
177060	heart
177062	of the
earth
177065	three
days
and
177069	three
nights
The men
of Nineveh
will stand up
177075	in
177077	the
judgment
177080	with
177083	the
generation
this
and
will condemn
it
for
they repented
177092	at
177094	the
177096	preaching
of Jonah
and
behold
177101	greater
than Jonah
here
177105	The queen
of [the] south
will rise up
177109	in
177111	the
judgment
177114	with
177117	the
generation
this
and
will condemn
it
for
she came
177126	from
177128	the
177130	ends
177132	of the
earth
to hear
177136	the
177138	wisdom
of Solomon
and
behold
177143	greater
than Solomon
here
When
now
177149	the
177151	unclean
spirit
is gone out
177155	from
177157	the
man
it passes
177161	through
177163	waterless
places
seeking
rest
and
none
finds [it]
Then
it says
177173	To
177175	the
177177	house
of me
I will return
from where
I came out
And
having come
it finds [it]
being unoccupied
and
swept
and
put in order
Then
it goes
and
takes
177195	with
itself
177198	seven
177200	other
177202	spirits
177204	more evil
than itself
and
having entered in
they dwell
there
and
becomes
177213	the
177215	last
177218	of the
man
that
worse
177223	than the
first
So
it will be
177228	also
177232	unto
generation
this
177236	the
evil
While
He
was speaking
177242	to the
crowds
behold
177246	the
mother
and
177250	the
177252	brothers
of Him
were standing
outside
seeking
to Him
to speak
Said
now
someone
to Him
Behold
177265	the
177267	mother
of You
and
177271	the
177273	brothers
of you
outside
are standing
seeking
to You
to speak
-
And
answering
He said
to the [one]
telling
Him
Who
is
177290	the
177292	mother
of Me
and
who
are
177298	the
177300	brothers
of Me
And
having stretched out
177305	the
177307	hand
of Him
177310	to
177312	the
177314	disciples
of Him
He said
Behold
177319	the
177321	mother
of Me
and
177325	the
177327	brothers
of Me
Whoever
for
-
shall do
177334	the
177336	will
177338	the
177340	Father
of Me
177343	who [is]
177345	in
[the] heavens
he
177349	My
brother
and
sister
and
mother
is
177357	In
177360	the
day
that
having gone forth
177365	-
Jesus
177368	[from] the
house
was sitting
177372	by
177374	the
sea
And
were gathered together
177379	to
Him
177382	crowds
great
so that
He
177387	into
a boat
having entered
sat down
and
177393	all
177395	the
crowd
177398	on
177400	the
shore
stood
And
He spoke
to them
many things
177408	in
parables
saying
Behold
went out
the [one]
sowing
-
to sow
And
177419	in
-
sowing
of him
some
indeed
fell
177427	along
177429	the
road
and
having come
177434	the
birds
devoured
them
Other
now
fell
177442	upon
177444	the
rocky places
where
not
it had
177450	soil
much
and
immediately
it sprang up
177456	through
-
not
having
177461	depth
of soil
[the] sun
now
having risen
they were scorched
and
177469	through
the
not
having
root
were dried up
Other
now
fell
177479	upon
177481	the
thorns
and
grew up
177486	the
thorns
and
choked
them
Other
now
fell
177495	upon
177497	the
177499	soil
177501	-
good
and
were yielding
fruit
some
indeed
a hundredfold
some
now
sixty
some
now
thirty
The [one]
having
ears
let him hear
And
having come to [Him]
177522	the
disciples
said
to Him
177527	Because of
why
177530	in
parables
speak You
to them
-
And
answering
He said
Because
to you
it has been granted
to know
177543	the
177545	mysteries
177547	of the
177549	kingdom
177551	of the
heavens
to them
however
not
it has been granted
Whoever
for
has
will be given
to him
and
he will be in abundance
whoever
now
not
has
177569	even
what
he has
will be taken away
177574	from
him
177577	Because of
this
177580	in
parables
to them
I speak
Because
seeing
not
do they see
and
hearing
not
do they hear
nor
do they understand
And
is fulfilled
in them
177598	the
177600	prophecy
of Isaiah
-
saying
In hearing
you will hear
and
177608	no
not
understand
and
seeing
you will see
and
177616	no
not
perceive
Has grown dull
for
177622	the
177624	heart
177627	of the
people
this
and
177632	with the
ears
barely
they have heard
and
177638	the
177640	eyes
of them
they have closed
not
lest
they should see
177647	with the
eyes
and
177651	with the
ears
they should hear
and
177656	with the
heart
they should understand
and
should return
and
I will heal
them
177665	Of you
however
blessed
177669	[are] the
eyes
because
they see
and
177675	the
177677	ears
of you
because
they hear
Truly
for
I say
to you
that
177687	many
prophets
and
righteous [men]
longed
to see
what
you see
and
not
saw
and
to hear
what
you hear
and
not
heard
You
therefore
hear
177709	the
177711	parable
of the [one]
having sown
Everyone
hearing
177717	the
177719	word
177721	of the
kingdom
and
not
understanding
comes
177728	the
evil one
and
snatches away
that
having been sown
177735	in
177737	the
177739	heart
of him
This
is
the [one]
177745	on
177747	the
path
having been sown
That which
now
177753	upon
177755	the
rocky places
having been sown
this
is
the [one]
177762	the
word
hearing
and
immediately
177768	with
joy
receiving
it
no
he has
now
root
177777	in
himself
but
temporary
is
having come
however
tribulation
or
persecution
177788	on account of
177790	the
word
immediately
he falls away
That which
now
177797	among
177799	the
thorns
having been sown
this
is
the [one]
177806	the
word
hearing
and
177811	the
177813	care
177815	-
present age
and
177819	the
177821	deceit
177823	-
of riches
choke
177827	the
word
and
unfruitful
it becomes
That
however
177835	on
177837	the
177839	good
soil
having been sown
this
is
the [one]
177846	the
word
hearing
and
understanding
who
indeed
brings forth fruit
and
produces
some
indeed
a hundredfold
some
now
sixty
some
now
thirty
177866	Another
parable
put He before
them
saying
Has become like
177873	the
177875	kingdom
177877	of the
heavens
177880	a man
having sown
177883	good
seed
177886	in
177888	the
177890	field
of him
177893	In
now
the [time]
are sleeping
177898	the
men
came
177902	his
177904	-
enemy
and
sowed
weeds
177910	in [the]
177912	midst
177914	of the
wheat
and
went away
When
now
sprouted
177922	the
plants
and
fruit
produced
then
appeared
177930	also
177932	the
weeds
Having come to [him]
now
177937	the
177939	servants
177941	the
master of the house
said
to him
Sir
not
177948	good
seed
did you sow
177952	in
177954	-
177956	your
field
How
then
has it
the weeds
-
And
he said
to them
177967	An enemy
a man
this
did
177972	-
And
the servants
to him
said
Do you desire
then
[that] having gone forth
we should gather
them
-
And
he said
No
not
lest
gathering
177990	the
weeds
you would uproot
177994	with
them
177997	the
wheat
Allow
to grow together
both
178003	until
178005	the
harvest
and
178009	in
178011	the time
178013	of the
harvest
I will say
178017	to the
harvesters
Gather
first
178022	the
weeds
and
bind
them
178028	into
bundles
178031	in order
-
to burn
them
178036	-
and
the wheat
gather together
178041	into
178043	the
178045	barn
of me
178048	Another
parable
put He before
them
saying
Like
is
178056	the
178058	kingdom
178060	of the
heavens
178063	to a grain
of mustard
which
having taken
a man
sowed
178070	in
178072	the
178074	field
of him
which
smallest
indeed
is
178081	of all
178083	the
seeds
when
however
it is grown
greater
178090	than the
garden plants
it is
and
becomes
a tree
so that
come
178099	the
178101	birds
178103	of the
air
and
perch
178108	in
178110	the
178112	branches
of it
178115	Another
parable
spoke He
to them
Like
is
178122	the
178124	kingdom
178126	of the
heavens
to leaven
which
having taken
a woman
hid
178134	in
178136	of flour
178138	measures
three
178141	until
of it
was leavened
all
178146	These things
all
spoke
178150	-
Jesus
178153	in
parables
178156	to the
crowds
and
178160	without
a parable
not
He was speaking
to them
so that
might be fulfilled
that
having been spoken
178170	by
178172	the
prophet
saying
I will open
178177	in
parables
178180	the
178182	mouth
of Me
I will utter
things hidden
178187	from
[the] foundation
Then
having dismissed
178192	the
crowds
He went
178196	into
178198	the
house
And
came
to Him
178204	the
178206	disciples
of Him
saying
Explain
to us
178212	the
178214	parable
178216	of the
178218	weeds
178220	of the
field
-
And
answering
He said
The [One]
sowing
178229	the
178231	good
seed
is
178235	the
178237	Son
178239	-
of Man
178242	-
and
the field
is
178247	the
world
178250	-
and
178253	the good
seed
these
are
178258	the
178260	sons
178262	of the
kingdom
178265	-
and
the weeds
are
178270	the
178272	sons
178274	of the
evil [one]
178277	-
and
the enemy
-
having sown
them
is
178285	the
devil
178288	-
and
the harvest
178292	[the] consummation
of the age
is
178296	-
and
the harvesters
angels
are
As
therefore
is gathered
178305	the
weeds
and
in fire
is consumed
thus
it will be
178313	in
178315	the
178317	consummation
178319	of the
age
Will send forth
178323	the
178325	Son
178327	-
of Man
178330	the
178332	angels
of Him
and
they will gather
178337	out of
178339	the
178341	kingdom
of Him
178344	all
178346	the
causes of sin
and
those
practicing
178352	-
lawlessness
and
they will cast
them
178358	into
178360	the
178362	furnace
178364	of the
fire
there
will be
178369	the
weeping
and
178373	the
178375	gnashing
178377	of
teeth
Then
178381	the
righteous
will shine forth
as
178386	the
sun
178389	in
178391	the
178393	kingdom
178395	of the
178397	Father
of them
The [one]
having
ears
let him hear
Like
is
178406	the
178408	kingdom
178410	of the
heavens

having been hidden
178416	in
178418	the
field

having found
a man
hid
and
178426	for
178428	the
178430	joy
of it
goes
and
he sells
that
he has
and
buys
178441	the
field
that
Again
like

178458	fine
pearls

now
178463	one
178465	very precious
pearl
having gone away
he has sold
178470	all things
as many as
he had
and
bought
it

178482	kingdom
178484	of the

178496	of
178498	every
kind
having gathered together
which
when
it was filled
having drawn up
178506	on
178508	the
shore
and
having sat down
they collected
178514	the
good
178517	into
vessels
178520	the
and
bad
out
they cast
Thus
will it be
178528	in
178530	the
178532	consummation
178534	of the
age
will go out
178538	the
angels
and
will separate
178543	the
evil
178546	from
178548	[the] midst
178550	of the
righteous
and
will cast
them
178556	into
178558	the
178560	furnace
178562	of the
fire
There
will be
178567	the
weeping
and
178571	the
178573	gnashing
178575	of the
teeth
Have you understood
178579	these things
all
They say
to Him
Yes
-
And
He said
to them
178589	Because of
this
178592	every
178594	scribe
having been discipled
178597	into the
178599	kingdom
178601	of the
heavens

a man
a master of a house
who
puts forth
178610	out of
178612	the
178614	treasure
of him
[things] new
and
old
And
it came to pass
when
had finished
178624	-
Jesus
178628	the
parables
these
He withdrew
from there
And
having come
178636	into
178638	the
178640	region
His [own]
He was teaching
them
178645	in
178647	the
178649	synagogue
of them
so that
are astonished
they
and
are saying
From where
to this [man]
178660	the
wisdom
this
and
178665	the
miraculous powers
Not
this
is
178671	the
178674	of the
carpenter
Son

Mary
And

Judas
And
178700	the
178702	sisters
of Him
not
all
178707	with
us
are
From where
then
to this [man]
178714	these things
all
And
they were offended
178719	at
Him
178722	-
But
Jesus
said
to them
Not

a prophet
without Honor

not
178734	in
178736	the
hometown
and
178740	in
178742	the
178744	household
of him
And
not
He did
there
178751	miracles
many
178754	because of
178756	the
178758	unbelief
of them
178761	At
178763	that
178765	-
time
heard
Herod
178770	the
tetrarch
178773	the
178775	news
of Jesus
and
he said
178780	to
178782	[the] servants
of him
This
is
John
178788	the
Baptist
he
is risen
178793	from
178795	the
dead
and
178799	because of
this
178802	the
miraculous powers
are working
178806	in
him
178809	-
For
Herod
having seized
178814	-
John
he bound
and
178819	in
prison
put [him]
178823	on account of
Herodias
178826	the
178828	wife
of Philip
178831	the
178833	brother
of him
Had been saying
for
178838	-
John
to him
Not
it is lawful
for you
to have
her
Although
wishing
him
to kill
he feared
178852	the
multitude
because
178856	as
a prophet
him
they were holding
178861	[The] birthday
now
having been celebrated
178865	-
of Herod
danced
178869	the
178871	daughter
178873	-
of Herodias
178876	in
178878	the
midst
and
pleased
178883	-
Herod
whereupon
178887	with
oath
he promised
to her
to give
whatever
if
she should ask
-
And
having been urged on
178899	by
178901	the
178903	mother
of her
Give
me
she says
here
178910	upon
a platter
178913	the
178915	head
of John
178918	the
Baptist
And
having been grieved
178923	the
king
178926	on account of
178928	the
oaths
and
those
reclining with [him]
he commanded [it]
to be given
And
he having sent
beheaded
John
178940	in
178942	the
prison
And
was brought
178947	the
178949	head
of him
178952	on
a platter
and
was given
178957	to the
girl
and
she brought [it]
178962	to
178964	[the] mother
of her
And
having come
178969	the
178971	disciples
of him
took
178975	the
body
and
buried
it
and
having come
they told
178984	-
Jesus
Having heard
now
178989	-
Jesus
withdrew
from there
178994	by
boat
178997	to
178999	a secluded
place
179002	apart
Himself
And
having heard [of it]
179007	the
crowds
followed
Him
on foot
179013	from
179015	the
towns
And
having gone out
He saw
179021	great
a crowd
and
was moved with compassion
179026	toward
them
and
healed
179031	the
179033	sick
of them
Evening
now
having come
came
to Him
179041	the
disciples
saying
Desolate
is
179047	this
place
and
179051	the
time
already
is gone by
Dismiss
therefore
179058	the
crowds
that
having gone
179063	into
179065	the
villages
they might buy
for themselves
food
179071	-
And
Jesus
said
to them
No
need
they have
to go away
Give
to them
you
to eat
-
And
they say
to Him
Not
we have
here
if
not
179094	five
loaves
and
179098	two
fish
-
And
He said
Bring
to Me
here
them
And
having commanded
179110	the
crowds
to sit down
179114	on
179116	the
grass
having taken
179120	the
179122	five
loaves
and
179126	the
179128	two
fish
having looked up
179132	to
179134	-
heaven
He spoke a blessing
and
having broken
He gave
179141	to the
disciples
179144	the
loaves
179147	-
and
the disciples
179151	to the
crowds
And
ate
all
and
were satisfied
and
they took up
179161	that
179163	being over and above
179165	of the
fragments
179168	twelve
179170	hand-baskets
full
Those
then
eating
were
179177	men
179179	about
five thousand
179182	besides
women
and
children
And
immediately
He compelled
179190	the
disciples
to enter
179194	into
179196	the
boat
and
to go before
Him
179202	to
179204	the
other side
179207	until
that
He would have dismissed
179211	the
crowds
And
having dismissed
179216	the
crowds
He went up
179220	on
179222	the
mountain
179225	by
Himself
to pray
Evening
now
having arrived
alone
He was
there
179235	-
And
the boat
now

many
179243	from
179245	the
land
being
tossed
179250	by
179252	the
waves
was
for
contrary [was]
179258	the
wind
179261	In [the] fourth
now
179264	watch
179266	of the
night
He went
179270	to
them
walking
179274	on
179276	the
sea
179279	-
And
the disciples
having seen
Him
179285	on
179287	the
sea
walking
were troubled
saying
-
A ghost
it is
And
179297	in
179299	-
fear
they cried out
Immediately
now
spoke
179306	-
Jesus
to them
saying
Take courage
I
it is
not
fear
Answering
now
to Him
179319	-
Peter
said
Lord
if
You
[it] is
command
me
to come
179330	to
You
179333	upon
179335	the
waters
-
And
He said
Come
And
having descended
179344	from
179346	the
boat
Peter
walked
179351	upon
179353	the
water
and
came
179358	to
179360	-
Jesus
Seeing
now
179365	the
wind
he was afraid
and
having begun
to sink
he cried out
saying
Lord
save
me
Immediately
now
179379	-
Jesus
having stretched out
179383	the
hand
took hold
of him
and
says
to him
[You] of little faith
179392	of
why
did you doubt
And
having entered
they
179399	into
179401	the
boat
ceased
179405	the
wind
179408	Those
then
179411	in
179413	the
boat
worshiped
Him
saying
Truly
179420	of God
Son
You are
And
having crossed over
they came
179427	to
179429	the
land
179432	of
Gennesaret
And
having recognized
Him
179438	the
179440	men
179443	the
place
of that
sent
179448	to
179451	all
179453	the
surrounding region
that
and
brought
to Him
179460	all
those
sick
being
and
they were begging
Him
that
only
they might touch
179471	the
179473	fringe
179475	of the
179477	garment
of Him
and
as many as
touched
were cured
Then
come
179486	-
to Jesus
179489	from
Jerusalem
Pharisees
and
scribes
saying
179496	Because of
why
179499	the
179501	disciples
of You
break
179505	the
179507	tradition
179509	of the
elders
Not
for
they wash
179515	the
hands
when
bread
they shall eat
-
And
answering
He said
to them
179526	Because of
why
179529	also
you
break
179533	the
179535	commandment
179537	-
of God
179540	on account of
179542	the
179544	tradition
of you
179547	-
For
God
commanded
Honor
179553	the
Father
and
179557	the
mother
and
The [one]
speaking evil of
father
or
mother
in death
must end
You
however
say
Whoever
-
shall say
179574	to the
father
or
179578	the
mother
[It is] a gift
whatever
if
179584	by
me
you might be profited
179588	no
not
he shall honor
179592	the
179594	father
of himself
or
179598	the
179600	mother
of himself
And
you made void
179605	the
179607	commandment
179609	-
of God
179612	on account of
179614	the
179616	tradition
of you
Hypocrites
Rightly
prophesied
179622	concerning
you
Isaiah
saying
179628	The
people
this
179632	with the
lips
Me
it honors
179637	the
however
179640	heart
of them
far away
is kept
179645	from
Me
in vain
then
they worship
Me
teaching [as]
doctrines
179654	[the] precepts
of men
And
having called to [Him]
179659	the
crowd
He said
to them
Hear
and
understand
Not
what
is entering
179670	into
179672	the
mouth
defiles
179676	the
man
but
that
going forth
179682	out of
179684	the
mouth
this
defiles
179689	the
man
Then
having come near
179694	the
disciples
said
to Him
Know You
that
179701	the
Pharisees
having heard
179705	the
saying
were offended
-
And
answering
He said
179713	Every
plant
that
not
has planted
179719	the
179722	Father
of Me
179725	-
Heavenly
it will be rooted up
Leave
them
179731	Blind
they are
179734	guides
of the blind
Blind
now
blind
if
they lead
both
179743	into
a pit
will fall
Answering
then
179749	-
Peter
said
to Him
Explain
to us
179756	the
parable
-
And
He said
Still
179763	also
you
without understanding
are
Not yet
understand you
that
179771	everything
-
entering
179775	into
179777	the
mouth
179780	into
179782	the
stomach
goes
and
179787	into
[the] sewer
is cast out
The things
however
going forth
179794	out of
179796	the
mouth
179799	out of
179801	the
heart
come forth
and these
defile
179807	the
man
179810	Out of
for
179813	the
heart
come forth
179817	thoughts
evil
murders
adulteries
sexual immorality
thefts
false testimonies
slanders
These
are
the things
defiling
179830	the
man
-
but
179835	with unwashed
hands
to eat
not
defiles
179841	the
man
And
having gone forth
from there
179847	-
Jesus
withdrew
179851	to
179853	the
179855	district
of Tyre
and
Sidon
And
behold
179862	a woman
Canaanite
179865	from
179868	the
region
same
having approached
was crying out
saying
Have mercy on
me
Lord
179878	Son
of David
179881	the
179883	daughter
of me
miserably
is possessed by a demon
-
And
not
He answered
her
a word
And
having come to [him]
179896	the
179898	disciples
of Him
were imploring
Him
saying
Dismiss
her
for
she cries out
179908	after
us
-
And
answering
He said
Not
I was sent
if
not
179919	to
179922	the
sheep
-
being lost
179927	of [the] house
of Israel
-
And
having come
she was worshiping
Him
saying
Lord
help
me
-
And
answering
He said
Not
it is
right
to take
179947	the
179949	bread
179951	of the
children
and
to cast [it]
179956	to the
dogs
-
And
she said
Yes
Lord
179964	even
however
179967	the
dogs
eat
179971	of
179973	the
crumbs
-
falling
179978	from
179980	the
179982	table
179984	of the
179986	masters
of them
Then
answering
179991	-
Jesus
said
to her
179996	O
woman
great [is]
180000	of you
180002	the
faith
Be it
to you
as
you desire
And
was healed
180011	the
180013	daughter
of her
180016	from
180019	the
hour
that
And
having departed
from there
180026	-
Jesus
went
180030	along
180032	the
180034	Sea
180036	-
of Galilee
and
having gone up
180041	on
180043	the
mountain
He was sitting
there
And
came
to Him
180051	crowds
great
having
180055	with
them
lame
crippled
blind
mute
and
180063	others
many
and
they placed
them
180069	at
180071	the
180073	feet
of Him
and
He healed
them
so that
180080	the
crowd
marveled
seeing
mute
speaking
crippled
restored
and
lame
walking
and
blind
seeing
and
they glorified
180097	the
180099	God
of Israel
180102	-
And
Jesus
having called to [him]
180107	the
180109	disciples
of Him
said
I am moved with compassion
180114	toward
180116	the
crowd
because
already
180121	days
three
they continue
with Me
and
nothing
have
that
they might eat
and
to send away
180133	them
hungry
not
I am willing
not
lest
they faint
180141	on
180143	the
way
And
say
to Him
180149	the
disciples
From where
to us
180154	in
a secluded place
180157	loaves
so many
as
to satisfy
180162	a crowd
so great
And
says
to them
180168	-
Jesus
180171	How many
loaves
have you
-
And
they said
Seven
and
180180	a few
small fish
And
He having commanded
180185	the
crowds
to sit down
180189	on
180191	the
ground
having taken
180195	the
180197	seven
loaves
and
180201	the
fish
and
having given thanks
He broke [them]
and
was giving
180209	to
disciples
180212	-
and the
disciples
180216	to the
crowd
And
ate
all
and
were satisfied
and
180225	that
180227	being over and above
180229	of the
fragments
they took up
180233	seven
180235	baskets
full
Those
then
eating
were
180242	four thousand
men
180245	besides
women
and
children
And
having dismissed
180252	the
crowds
He entered
180256	into
180258	the
boat
and
came
180263	to
180265	the
180267	region
of Magadan
And
having approached
180272	the
Pharisees
and
Sadducees
testing
asked
Him
180280	a sign
180282	out of
180284	-
heaven
to show
them
-
And
answering
He said
to them
Evening
having come
you say
Fair weather
is red
for
180300	the
sky
And
in the morning
Today
a storm
is red
for
being overcast
180310	the
sky
180313	The
indeed
180316	appearance
180318	of the
sky
you know [how]
to discern
180323	-
but
180326	the signs
180328	of the
times
not
you are able
180333	A generation
evil
and
adulterous
a sign
seeks
and
a sign
not
will be given
to it
if
not
180347	the
180349	sign
of Jonah
And
having left
them
He went away
And
having come
180358	the
disciples
180361	to
180363	the
other side
they forgot
bread
to take
180369	-
And
Jesus
said
to them
Watch
and
beware
180378	of
180380	the
180382	leaven
180384	of the
Pharisees
and
Sadducees
-
And
they were reasoning
180392	among
themselves
saying
Because
bread
not
we took
Having known [this]
however
180402	-
Jesus
said
Why
reason you
180408	among
yourselves
O [you] of little faith
because
bread
not
you took
Not yet
do you understand
nor
remember
180420	the
180422	five
180424	loaves
180426	for the
five thousand
and
180430	how many
hand-baskets
you gathered
Nor
180435	the
180437	seven
180439	loaves
180441	for the
four thousand
and
180445	how many
baskets
you gathered
How
not
understand you
that
not
180454	concerning
bread
I spoke
to you
to beware
also
180461	of
180463	the
180465	leaven
180467	of the
Pharisees
and
Sadducees
Then
they understood
that
not
He said
to beware
180478	of
180480	the
180482	leaven
180484	of
bread
but
180488	of
180490	the
180492	teaching
180494	of the
Pharisees
and
Sadducees
Having come
then
180501	-
Jesus
180504	into
180506	the
180508	district
180510	of Caesarea
180512	-
Philippi
He was questioning
180516	the
180518	disciples
of Him
saying
Whom
do pronounce
180524	-
men
to be
180528	the
180530	Son
180532	of
man
-
And
they said
Some
indeed
John
180541	the
Baptist
others
now
Elijah
others
now
Jeremiah
or
180551	one
180553	of the
prophets
He says
to them
You
but
whom
Me
do you pronounce
to be
Answering
now
Simon
Peter
said
You
are
180571	the
Christ
180574	the
180576	Son
180578	of
God
the
living
Answering
now
180585	-
Jesus
said
to him
Blessed
are you
Simon
Barjona
For
flesh
and
blood
not
revealed [it]
to you
but
180602	the
180604	Father
of Me
180607	who [is]
180609	in
180611	the
heavens
I also
now
to you
say
that
you
are
Peter
and
180623	on
180625	this
180627	the
rock
I will build
180631	My
180633	-
church
and
180637	[the] gates
of hades
not
will prevail against
it
I will give
to you
180645	the
180647	keys
180649	of the
180651	kingdom
180653	of the
heavens
and
whatever
if
you might bind
180660	on
180662	the
earth
180665	will be
bound
180668	in
180670	the
heavens
and
whatever
if
you might loose
180677	on
180679	the
earth
180682	will be
loosed
180685	in
180687	the
heavens
Then
instructed He
180692	the
disciples
that
to no one
they should say
that
He
is
180701	the
Christ
180704	From
that time
began
Jesus
Christ
to show
180711	to the
180713	disciples
of Him
that
it is necessary for
Him
180719	to
Jerusalem
to go away
and
many things
to suffer
180726	from
180728	the
elders
and
chief priests
and
scribes
and
to be killed
and
180738	on the
180740	third
day
to be raised
And
having taken aside
Him
180747	-
Peter
began
to rebuke
Him
saying
Far be it
from You
Lord
180757	never
not
will be
to You
this
-
And
having turned
He said
180767	-
to Peter
Get
180771	behind
Me
Satan
180775	A stumbling block
you are
to Me
For
not
your thoughts are of
180782	the things
180784	-
of God
but
180788	the
180790	things
of men
Then
180794	-
Jesus
said
180798	to
180800	disciples
of Him
If
anyone
desires
180806	after
Me
to come
let him deny
himself
and
take up
180814	the
180816	cross
of him
and
follow
Me
Whoever
for
if
might desire
180826	the
180828	life
of him
to save
will lose
it
whoever
however
-
might lose
180838	the
180840	life
of him
180843	on account of
Me
will find
it
What
for
will it profit
a man
if
180853	the
180855	world
whole
he gains
180859	-
but
180862	the soul
of him
loses
Or
what
will give
a man
180870	[as] an exchange for
180872	the
180874	soul
of him
Is about
for
180879	the
180881	Son
180883	of the
man
to come
180887	in
180889	the
180891	glory
180893	the
180895	Father
of Him
180898	with
180900	the
180902	angels
of Him
and
then
He will give
to each
180909	according to
180911	the
180913	deeds
of him
Truly
I say
to you
-
there are
180921	some
of those
here
standing
who
180927	no
not
shall taste
of death
until
-
they have seen
180935	the
180937	Son
180939	-
of Man
coming
180943	in
180945	the
180947	kingdom
of Him
And
180951	after
180953	days
six
takes with [Him]
180957	-
Jesus
180960	-
Peter
and
James
and
John
180967	the
180969	brother
of him
and
brings up
them
180975	into
180977	a mountain
high
180980	by
themselves
And
He was transfigured
180985	before
them
and
shone
180990	the
180992	face
of Him
180995	like
180997	the
sun
181000	-
and
181003	the clothes
of Him
became
white
181008	as
181010	the
light
And
behold
appeared
to them
Moses
and
Elijah
talking
181021	with
Him
Answering
now
181026	-
Peter
said
181030	-
to Jesus
Lord
good
it is
for us
here
to be
If
You wish
I will make
here
181043	three
tabernacles
for You
one
and
for Moses
one
and
for Elijah
one
While yet
he
was speaking
behold
181058	a cloud
bright
overshadowed
them
and
behold
a voice
181066	out of
181068	the
cloud
saying
This
is
181074	the
181076	Son
of Me
181079	the
beloved
181082	in
whom
I am well pleased
Listen
to Him
And
having heard [it]
181090	the
disciples
fell
181094	upon
181096	face
of them
and
were terrified
greatly
And
having come to [them]
181104	-
Jesus
and
having touched
them
He said
Rise up
and
not
be afraid
Having lifted up
and
181117	the
181119	eyes
of them
no one
they saw
if
not
181127	Himself
Jesus
alone
And
[as] were descending
they
181134	from
181136	the
mountain
instructed
them
181141	-
Jesus
saying
To no one
tell
181147	the
vision
181150	until
that
181153	the
181155	Son
181157	-
of Man
181160	out from
[the] dead
is risen
And
asked
Him
181167	the
disciples
saying
Why
then
181173	the
scribes
say
that
Elijah
it behooves
to come
first
-
And
answering
He said
Elijah
indeed
comes
and
will restore
all things
I say
however
to you
that
Elijah
already
is come
and
not
they knew
him
but
did
181205	to
him
whatever
they desired
Thus
also
181212	the
181214	Son
181216	-
of Man
is about
to suffer
181221	from
them
Then
understood
181226	the
disciples
that
181230	concerning
John
181233	the
Baptist
He spoke
to them
And
they having come
181240	to
181242	the
crowd
came
to Him
a man
kneeling down to
Him
and
saying
Lord
have mercy on
181254	my
181256	-
son
for
he is epileptic
and
miserably
suffers
often
for
he falls
181267	into
181269	the
fire
and
often
181274	into
181276	the
water
And
I brought
him
181282	to the
181284	disciples
of You
and
not
they were able
him
to heal
Answering
now
181294	-
Jesus
said
181298	O
181300	generation
unbelieving
and
perverted
181305	how long
when
181308	with
you
will I be
181312	How long
when
will I bear with
you
Bring
to Me
him
here
And
rebuked
him
181324	-
Jesus
and
went out
181329	from
him
181332	the
demon
and
was healed
181337	the
boy
181340	from
181343	the
hour
that
Then
having come
181349	the
disciples
181352	-
to Jesus
181355	in
private
they said
181359	Because of
why
we
not
were able
to cast out
it
-
And
He said
to them
181371	Because of
181373	the
181375	little faith
of you
Truly
for
I say
to you
If
you have
181384	faith
181386	as
181388	a seed
of mustard
you will say
181393	to the
mountain
to this
Move
from here
to there
and
it will move
And
nothing
will be impossible
for you
Were abiding
now
they
181409	in
181411	-
Galilee
said
to them
181416	-
Jesus
Is about
181420	the
181422	Son
181424	-
of Man
to be betrayed
181428	into
181430	[the] hands
of men
and
they will kill
Him
and
181437	on the
181439	third
day
He will be raised up
And
they were grieved
deeply
Having come
now
they
181449	to
Capernaum
came
those
181454	the
didrachmas
collecting
181458	-
to Peter
and
said
181463	The
181465	Teacher
of you
not
does he pay
didrachmas
He says
Yes
And
he having entered
181475	into
181477	the
house
anticipated
him
181482	-
Jesus
saying
What
you
do think
Simon
181490	The
181492	kings
181494	of the
earth
181497	from
whom
do they receive
custom
or
tribute
181504	From
181506	the
181508	sons
of them
or
181512	from
181514	-
strangers
He having said
now
181519	From
181521	the
strangers
said
to him
181526	-
Jesus
Then
free
are
181532	the
sons
That
however
not
we might offend
them
having gone
181541	to
sea
cast
a hook
and
181547	the
181549	having come up
181551	first
fish
take
and
having opened
181557	the
181559	mouth
of it
you will find
a four-drachma coin
That
having taken
give
to them
181568	for
Me
and
yourself
181573	In
181575	that
181577	-
hour
came
181581	the
disciples
181584	-
to Jesus
saying
Who
then
[the] greatest
is
181592	in
181594	the
181596	kingdom
181598	of the
heavens
And
having called to [Him]
a child
He set
it
181606	in
181608	midst
of them
and
said
Truly
I say
to you
if
not
you turn
and
become
181621	as
181623	the
little children
181626	no
not
shall you enter
181630	into
181632	the
181634	kingdom
181636	of the
heavens
Whoever
therefore
will humble
himself
181643	as
181646	the
little child
this
he
is
181652	the
greatest
181655	in
181657	the
181659	kingdom
181661	of the
heavens
And
whoever
if
shall receive
181668	one
181670	little child
such
181673	in
181675	the
181677	name
of Me
Me
receives
Whoever
then
-
shall cause to stumble
181686	one
181689	of the
little ones
of these
-
believing
181695	in
Me
it is better
for him
that
should be hung
181702	a millstone
heavy
181705	around
181707	the
181709	neck
of him
and
he be sunk
181714	in
181716	the
181718	depth
181720	of the
sea
Woe
181724	to the
world
181727	because of
181729	the
causes of sin
Necessary [are]
for
to come
181735	the
stumbling blocks
but
woe
181740	to the
man
181743	by
whom
181746	the
offense
comes
If
now
181752	the
181754	hand
of you
or
181758	the
181760	foot
of you
causes to sin
you
cut off
it
and
cast [it]
181769	from
you
better
for you
it is
to enter
181776	into
181778	-
life
crippled
or
lame
than
181785	two
hands
or
181789	two
feet
having
to be cast
181794	into
181796	the
181798	fire
181800	-
eternal
And
if
181805	the
181807	eye
of you
causes to sin
you
gouge out
it
and
cast [it]
181816	from
you
better
for you
it is
one-eyed
181823	into
181825	-
life
to enter
than
181830	two
eyes
having
to be cast
181835	into
181837	the
181839	hell
181841	of the
fire
See [that]
not
you despise
181847	one
181850	of the
little ones
of these
I say
for
to you
that
181858	the
181860	angels
of them
181863	in
[the] heavens
181866	continually
always
behold
181870	the
181872	face
181874	of the
181876	Father
of me
181879	who [is]
181881	in
[the] heavens
What
you
do think
If
there should be
181889	to any
man
181892	a hundred
sheep
and
has gone astray
181897	one
181899	of
them
not
will he leave
181904	the
ninety
nine
181908	on
181910	the
mountains
and
having gone
seek
the [one]
going astray
And
if
he should
find
it
truly
I say
to you
that
he rejoices
181928	over
it
more
than
181933	over
181935	the
ninety
nine
-
not
having gone astray
Thus
not
it is
[the] will
181946	of
181948	the
181950	Father
of you
181953	who [is]
181955	in
[the] heavens
that
should perish
181960	one
181963	of the
little ones
of these
If
now
sins
181970	the
181972	brother
of you
go
reprove
him
181978	between
181980	you
and
him
alone
If
you
he will hear
you have gained
181989	the
181991	brother
of you
If
however
not
he will hear
take
181999	with
you
182002	more
one
or
two
that
182008	upon
182010	[the] testimony
182012	of two
witnesses
or
of three
may be strengthened
182018	every
word
If
now
he fails to listen
to them
tell [it]
182026	to the
church
If
now
182031	also
182033	to the
church
he fails to listen
let him be
to you
182039	as
182041	the
pagan
and
182045	the
tax collector
Truly
I say
to you
how many
if
you shall bind
182054	on
182056	the
earth
182059	shall have been
bound
182062	in
heaven
and
how many
if
you shall loose
182069	on
182071	the
earth
182074	shall have been
loosed
182077	in
heaven
Again
truly
I say
to you
that
if
182086	two
might agree
182089	of
you
182092	on
182094	the
earth
182097	concerning
182099	any
matter
that
if
they shall ask
it will be done
for them
182107	by
182109	the
182111	Father
of Me
182114	who [is]
182116	in
[the] heavens
Where
for
182121	are
two
or
three
gathered together
182127	unto
182129	-
182131	My
name
there
am I
182136	in
182138	[the] midst
of them
Then
having come
182143	-
Peter
said
to Him
Lord
how often
will sin
182151	against
me
182154	the
182156	brother
of me
and
I will forgive
him
182162	Up to
seven times
Says
to him
182167	-
Jesus
Not
I say
to you
182173	up to
seven times
but
182177	up to
182179	seventy times
seven
182182	Because of
this
has become like
182186	the
182188	kingdom
182190	of the
heavens
to a man
a king
who
desired
to settle
accounts
182199	with
182201	the
182203	servants
of him
Having begun
then
he
to settle
was brought
one
to him
182213	a debtor
182215	of ten thousand
talents
Nothing
having
now
he
to pay
commanded
him
182225	the
master
to be sold
and
182230	the
wife
and
182234	the
children
and
182238	all
as many as
he had
and
payment to be made
Having fallen down
therefore
182246	the
servant
was bowing on his knees
to him
saying
Have patience
182253	with
me
and
all
I will pay
to you
Having been moved with compassion
now
182262	the
182264	master
182267	of the
servant
that
released
him
and
182274	the
debt
forgave
him
Having gone out
however
182282	the
servant
same
found
182287	one
182289	the
182291	fellow servants
of him
who
was owing
him
182297	a hundred
denarii
and
having seized
him
he was throttling [him]
saying
Pay
if
any
you owe
Having fallen down
therefore
182311	the
182313	fellow servant
of him
was begging
him
saying
Have patience
182320	with
me
and
I will pay
you
-
But
not
he was willing
rather
having gone
he cast
him
182334	into
prison
until
he should pay
that which
was owing
Having seen
therefore
182343	the
182345	fellow servants
of him
the things
having taken place
they were grieved
deeply
and
having gone
narrated
182355	to
182357	master
of themselves
182360	all
that
having taken place
Then
having called to
him
182367	the
182369	master
of him
says
to him
182374	Servant
evil
182378	all
182380	the
debt
that
I forgave
you
because
you begged
me
Not
did it behoove
182391	also
you
to have pitied
182395	the
182397	fellow servant
of you
as
also I
you
had pitied
And
having been angry
182406	the
182408	master
of him
delivered
him
182413	to the
jailers
182416	until
that
he should pay
182420	all
-
being owed
to him
Thus
182426	also
182428	the
182431	Father
of Me
182434	-
Heavenly
will do
to you
if
not
you forgive
each
182443	the
182445	brother
of him
182448	from
182450	the
182452	heart
of you
And
it came to pass
when
had finished
182459	-
Jesus
182463	the
words
these
He withdrew
182468	from
182470	-
Galilee
and
came
182475	to
182477	the
182480	region
182482	-
of Judea
182485	beyond
182487	the
Jordan
And
followed
Him
182493	crowds
great
and
He healed
them
there
And
came
to Him
Pharisees
testing
Him
and
saying
If
is it lawful
to divorce
182511	the
182513	a wife
to him
182516	for
182518	every
cause
Which
now
answering
He said
Not
have you read
that
the [One]
having created
182530	from [the]
beginning
male
and
female
made
them
and
said
182540	On account of
this
will leave
a man
182545	the
father
and
182549	the
mother
and
be joined with
182554	the
182556	wife
of him
and
will become
182561	the
two
182564	into
182566	flesh
one
so that
no longer
are they
two
but
182574	flesh
one
What
therefore
182579	-
God
united together
man
not
let separate
They say
to Him
Why
then
Moses
did command
to give
182593	a roll
of divorce
and
to send away
He says
to them
-
Moses
182602	in view of
182604	the
182606	hardness of heart
of you
allowed
you
to divorce
182612	the
182614	wives
of you
182617	from [the]
beginning
however
not
was [it]
this way
I say
now
to you
that
whoever
-
shall divorce
182631	-
182633	wife
of him
182636	except
182638	for
sexual immorality
and
shall marry
another
commits adultery
Say
to Him
182647	the
disciples
If
this
is
182653	the
182656	case
182658	of the
man
182661	with
182663	the
wife
not
it is better
to marry
-
And
He said
to them
Not
all
receive
182677	the
word
this
but only [those]
to whom
it has been given
There are
for
eunuchs
who
182688	from [the]
182690	womb
of [their] mother
were born
thus
and
there are
eunuchs
who
were made eunuchs
182700	by
182702	-
men
and
there are
eunuchs
who
made eunuchs of
themselves
182711	for the sake of
182713	the
182715	kingdom
182717	of the
heavens
The [one]
being able
to receive [it]
let him receive [it]
Then
were brought
to Him
little children
that
182729	the
hands
He might lay
on them
and
He might pray
182736	-
however
the disciples
rebuked
them
182742	-
And
Jesus
said
Permit
182748	the
little children
and
not
do forbid
them
to come
182756	to
Me
182759	of the
for
such kind
is
182764	the
182766	kingdom
182768	of the
heavens
And
having laid
182773	the
hands
upon them
He departed
from there
And
behold
one
having come
to Him
said
Teacher
182786	what
good [thing]
shall I do
that
I might have
182792	life
eternal
-
And
He said
to him
Why
Me
ask you
182802	about
182804	what is
good
Only One
is
182809	-
good
If
however
you desire
182815	into
182817	-
life
to enter
keep
182822	the
commandments
He says
to him
Which
182828	-
And
Jesus
said
-
Not
shall you murder
not
shall you commit adultery
not
shall you steal
not
shall you bear false witness
you shall honor
182843	the
father
and
182847	the
mother
and
you shall love
182852	-
182854	neighbor
of you
as
yourself
Says
to him
182861	the
young man
182864	Things
all these
I have kept
What
yet
lack I
Was saying
to him
182873	-
Jesus
If
you desire
perfect
to be
go
sell
182882	of you
the
possessing
and
give
poor
and
you will have
treasure
182892	in
[the] heavens
and
come
follow
Me
Having heard
now
182901	the
young man
182904	the
statement
he went away
grieving
182909	he was [one]
for
having
182913	possessions
many
182916	-
And
Jesus
said
182921	to the
182923	disciples
of Him
Truly
I say
to you
that
a rich man
with difficulty
will enter
182933	into
182935	the
182937	kingdom
182939	of the
heavens
Again
now
I say
to you
easier for
[it] is
a camel
182949	through [the]
182951	eye
of a needle
to go
than
a rich man
182957	into
182959	the
182961	kingdom
182963	of
God
Having heard
now
182968	the
disciples
were astonished
exceedingly
saying
Who
then
is able
to be saved
Having looked on [them]
now
182980	-
Jesus
said
to them
182985	With
men
this
impossible
is
182991	with
however
God
all things [are]
possible
Then
answering
182999	-
Peter
said
to Him
Behold
we
left
all things
and
followed
You
what
then
will be
to us
183015	-
And
Jesus
said
to them
Truly
I say
to you
that
you
-
having followed
Me
183029	in
183031	the
regeneration
when
shall sit down
183036	the
183038	Son
183040	-
of Man
183043	upon
183045	[the] throne
183047	of glory
of Him
will sit
183051	also
you
183054	on
183056	twelve
thrones
judging
183060	the
183062	twelve
183064	tribes
183066	-
of Israel
And
183070	everyone
who
has left
houses
or
brothers
or
sisters
or
father
or
mother
or
children
or
lands
183087	for the sake of
183089	-
183091	My
name
a hundredfold
will receive
and
183097	life
eternal
will inherit
183101	Many
however
will be
first
last
and
last
first
Like
for
is
183113	the
183115	kingdom
183117	of the
heavens
to a man
a master of a house
who
went out
183124	in [the]
morning
to hire
workmen
183129	for
183131	the
183133	vineyard
of him
Having agreed
then
183138	with
183140	the
workmen
183143	for
a denarius
183146	for the
day
he sent
them
183151	into
183153	the
183155	vineyard
of him
And
having gone out
183160	about
183162	the third
hour
he saw
183166	others
standing
183169	in
183171	the
marketplace
idle
and
to them
he said
Go
183179	also
you
183182	into
183184	the
vineyard
and
whatever
if
might be
right
I will give
you
-
And
they went
Again
then
having gone out
183200	about [the]
183202	sixth
and
ninth
hour
he did
likewise
183209	About
then
183212	the
eleventh
having gone out
he found
others
standing
and
he says
to them
Why
here
stand you
183225	all
183227	the
day
idle
They say
to him
Because
no one
us
has hired
He says
to them
Go
183240	also
You
183243	into
183245	the
vineyard
Evening
then
having arrived
says
183252	the
183254	master
183256	of the
vineyard
183259	to
183261	foreman
of him
Call
183265	the
workmen
and
pay
183270	the
wages
having begun
183274	from
183276	the
last
183279	unto
183281	the
first
having come
And
183286	those [hired]
183288	about
183290	the
183292	eleventh
hour
they received
each
a denarius
And
having come
183300	the
first
they thought
that
more
they will receive
but
they received
183309	those
183311	each
a denarius
183314	also
themselves
Having received
now
they were grumbling
183320	against
183322	the
master of the house
saying
183326	These
183328	the
last
183331	one
hour
have worked
and
equal
them
to us
you have made
those
having borne
183342	the
183344	burden
183346	of the
day
and
183350	the
scorching heat
-
And
answering
183356	to one
of them
he said
Friend
not
I do wrong
you
Not
for a denarius
did you agree with
me
Take
183369	what [is]
yours
and
go
I desire
now
183376	to this
183378	-
last
to give
as
183383	also
to you
not
is it lawful
for me
what
I will
to do
183392	with
183394	that which [is]
mine
Or
183398	the
183400	eye
of you
envious
is
because
I
generous
am
Thus
will be
183411	the
last
first
and
183416	the
first
last

And
going up
Jesus
183424	to
Jerusalem
He took
183428	the
twelve
183431	aside
themselves
and
183435	on
183437	the
way
He said
to them
Behold
we go up
183444	to
Jerusalem
and
183448	the
183450	Son
183452	-
of Man
will be betrayed
183456	to the
chief priests
and
scribes
and
they will condemn
Him
183464	to
death
and
they will betray
Him
183470	the
Gentiles
183473	unto
-
to mock
and
to flog
and
to crucify
and
183482	the
183484	third
day
He will rise again
Then
came
to Him
183491	the
183493	mother
183495	of the
183497	sons
of Zebedee
183500	with
183502	the
183504	sons
of her
kneeling down
and
asking
something
183511	from
Him
-
And
He said
to her
What
do you desire
She says
to Him
Say
that
might sit
183525	these
183527	-
183529	two
183531	sons
of mine
one
183535	on
[the] right hand
and
one
183540	on
183542	[the] left hand
of You
183545	in
183547	the
183549	kingdom
of You
Answering
now
183554	-
Jesus
said
Not
you know
what
you ask for
Are you able
to drink
183564	the
cup
which
I
am about
to drink
They say
to Him
We are able
He says
to them
183576	-
Indeed
183579	the cup
of Me
You will drink
-
but
to sit
183586	on
183588	[the] right hand
of Me
and
183592	on
[the] left
not
is
Mine
this
to give
but [to those]
for whom
it has been prepared
183603	by
183605	the
183607	Father
of Me
And
having heard [this]
183612	the
ten
were indignant
183616	about
183618	the
183620	two
brothers
183623	-
And
Jesus
having called to [him]
them
said
You know
that
183632	the
183634	rulers
183636	of the
Gentiles
exercise lordship over
them
and
183642	the
great ones
exercise authority over
them
Not
thus
will it be
183650	among
you
but
whoever
if
wishes
183657	among
you
great
to become
he will be
183663	your
servant
and
whoever
-
wishes
183670	among
you
to be
first
he will be
183676	your
slave
even as
183680	the
183682	Son
183684	-
of Man
not
came
to be served
but
to serve
and
to give
183694	the
183696	life
of Him
183699	[as] a ransom
183701	for
many
And
[as] were going out
they
183707	from
Jericho
followed
Him
183712	a crowd
great
And
behold
183717	two
183719	blind [men]
sitting
183722	beside
183724	the
road
having heard
that
Jesus
is passing by
cried out
saying
Lord
Have mercy on
us
183736	Son
of David
183739	-
And
the crowd
rebuked
them
that
they should be silent
-
But
all the more
they cried out
saying
Lord
have mercy on
us
183755	Son
of David
And
having stopped
183760	-
Jesus
called
them
and
said
What
do you desire
I should do
unto you
They say
to Him
Lord
that
might be opened
183776	the
183778	eyes
of us
Having been moved with compassion
then
183783	-
Jesus
touched
183787	the
183789	eyes
of them
and
immediately
they received sight
and
they followed
Him
And
when
they drew near
183801	to
Jerusalem
and
came
183806	to
Bethphage
183809	on
183811	the
183813	Mount
183815	-
of Olives
then
Jesus
sent
183821	two
disciples
saying
to them
Go
183827	into
183829	the
village
183832	-
183834	in front
of you
and
immediately
you will find
a donkey
having been tied
and
a colt
183844	with
her
having untied [them]
bring [them]
to Me
And
if
anyone
to you
says
anything
you will say
that
183858	the
Lord
183861	of them
need
has
Immediately
then
he will send
them
This
then
came to pass
that
it might be fulfilled
that
having been spoken
183876	by
183878	the
prophet
saying
Say
183883	to the
183885	daughter
of Zion
Behold
183889	the
183891	King
of you
comes
to you
gentle
and
mounted
183899	on
a donkey
even
183903	upon
a colt
183906	[the] foal
of a beast of burden
Having gone
then
183911	the
disciples
and
having done
as
commanded
them
183919	-
Jesus
they brought
183923	the
donkey
and
183927	the
colt
and
put
183932	upon
them
183935	their
cloaks
and
He sat
183940	on
them
183943	The
now
183946	very great
crowd
spread
183950	their
183952	the
cloaks
183955	on
183957	the
road
others
now
were cutting down
branches
183964	from
183966	the
trees
and
were spreading [them]
183971	on
183973	the
road
183976	The
now
crowds
-
going before
Him
and
those
following
were crying out
saying
Hosanna
183989	to the
183991	Son
of David
Blessed is
the [One]
coming
183997	in
183999	[the] name
of [the] Lord
Hosanna
184003	in
184005	the
highest
And
having entered
of Him
184011	into
Jerusalem
was stirred
184015	all
184017	the
city
saying
Who
is
this
184024	-
And
the crowds
were saying
This
is
184031	the
prophet
Jesus
184035	the [One]
184037	from
184039	Nazareth
184041	-
of Galilee
And
entered
Jesus
184047	into
184049	the
temple
and
cast out
184054	all
those
selling
and
buying
184060	in
184062	the
temple
and
184066	the
184068	tables
184070	of the
money changers
He overturned
and
184075	the
184077	seats
of those
selling
184081	the
doves
And
He says
to them
It has been written
184088	The
184090	house
of Me
184093	a house
of prayer
will be called
You
however
it
have made
184101	a den
of robbers
And
came
to Him
blind
and
lame
184110	in
184112	the
temple
and
He healed
them
Having seen
now
184120	the
chief priests
and
184124	the
scribes
184127	the
wonders
that
He did
and
184133	the
children
the
crying out
184138	in
184140	the
temple
and
saying
Hosanna
184146	to the
184148	Son
of David
they were indignant
and
said
to Him
Hear you
what
these
say
184159	-
And
Jesus
says
to them
Yes
never
did you read
-
184169	Out of [the]
184171	mouth
of babes
and
sucklings
You have prepared for yourself
praise
And
having left
them
He went
184182	out of
184184	the
city
184187	to
Bethany
and
He passed the night
there
In the morning
then
having come back
184196	into
184198	the
city
He became hungry
And
having seen
184205	fig tree
one
184208	along
184210	the
road
He came
184214	to
it
and
nothing
found
184220	on
it
if
not
leaves
only
And
He says
to it
Never
no more
184232	from
you
fruit
let there be
184237	to
184239	the
age
And
withered
immediately
184245	the
fig tree
And
having seen [it]
184250	the
disciples
marveled
saying
How
so quickly
withered
184258	the
fig tree
Answering
now
184263	-
Jesus
said
to them
Truly
I say
to you
if
you have
faith
and
not
do doubt
not
only
184279	the [miracle]
184281	of the
fig tree
will you do
but
even if
184288	to the
mountain
this
you should say
Be you taken away
and
be you cast
184296	into
184298	the
sea
it will come to pass
And
184303	all things
as many as
-
you might ask
184308	in
184310	-
prayer
believing
you will receive
And
having come
of Him
184318	into
184320	the
temple
came
to Him
teaching
184326	the
chief priests
and
184330	the
184332	elders
184334	of the
people
saying
184338	By
184340	what
authority
these things
are You doing
And
who
to You
gave
184350	the
authority
this
Answering
now
184356	-
Jesus
said
to them
Will ask
you
I also
184364	thing
one
which
if
you tell
Me
I also
to you
will say
184374	by
184376	what
authority
these things
I do
184381	The
baptism
184384	of
John
from where
was it
184389	From
heaven
or
184393	from
men
-
And
they were reasoning
184399	with
themselves
saying
If
we should say
184405	From
heaven
He will say
to us
184410	Because of
why
then
not
did you believe
him
If
however
we should say
184420	From
men
we fear
184424	the
multitude
all
for
184429	as
a prophet
hold
184433	-
John
And
answering
184438	-
Jesus
they said
Not
do we know
Said
to them
184446	also
He
Neither
I
tell
you
184453	by
184455	what
authority
these things
I do
What
however
you
think
A man
had
184466	sons
two
having come
184470	to the
first
he said
Son
go
today
work
184478	in
184480	the
vineyard
-
And
answering
he said
will I
master
however
Not
he went
Having come
then
184494	to the
second
he said
likewise
-
And
answering
he said
I [will]
sir
and
not
did he go
184508	Which
184510	of
184512	the
two
did
184516	the
184518	will
184520	of the
father
They say
184524	The
first
Says
to them
184529	-
Jesus
Truly
I say
to you
that
184536	the
tax collectors
and
184540	the
prostitutes
go before
you
184545	into
184547	the
184549	kingdom
184551	-
of God
Came
for
John
184557	to
you
184560	in [the]
184562	way
of righteousness
and
not
you did believe
him
184569	-
however
the tax collectors
and
184574	the
prostitutes
believed
him
you
then
having seen
not even
did repent
afterward
-
to believe
him
184588	Another
parable
hear
A man
there was
a master of a house
who
planted
a vineyard
and
a fence
it
placed around
and
dug
184604	in
it
a winepress
and
built
a tower
and
rented out
it
to farmers
and
traveled abroad
When
then
drew near
184620	the
184622	season
184624	of the
fruits
he sent
184628	the
184630	servants
of him
184633	to
184635	the
farmers
to receive
184639	the
184641	fruits
of him
And
having taken
184646	the
farmers
184649	the
184651	servants
of him
one
-
they beat
one
then
they killed
one
then
they stoned
Again
he sent
184665	other
184667	servants
184669	more
184671	than the
first
and
they did
to them
likewise
Afterward
then
he sent
184681	to
them
184684	the
184686	son
of him
saying
They will respect
184691	the
184693	son
of me
184696	-
But
the farmers
having seen
184701	the
son
said
184705	among
themselves
This
is
184710	the
heir
come
let us kill
him
and
gain possession of
184718	the
184720	inheritance
of him
And
having taking
him
they cast [him]
184727	out of
184729	the
vineyard
and
killed [him]
When
therefore
shall come
184737	the
184739	master
184741	of the
vineyard
what
will he do
184747	the
farmers
to those
They say
to him
[The] wretches
grievously
He will destroy
them
and
184758	the
vineyard
he will rent out
184762	to other
farmers
who
will give
to him
184768	the
fruits
184771	in
184773	the
184775	seasons
of them
Says
to them
184780	-
Jesus
Never
did you read
184785	in
184787	the
Scriptures
[The] stone
which
rejected
those
building
this
has become
184797	the
184799	chief
corner
184802	From
[the] Lord
was
this
and
it is
marvelous
184810	in
184812	[the] eyes
of us
184815	Because of
this
I say
to you
that
will be taken away
184822	from
you
184825	the
184827	kingdom
184829	-
of God
and
it will be given
184834	to a people
producing
184837	the
184839	fruits
of it
And
the [one]
having fallen
184845	on
184848	the
stone
this
will be broken
184853	on
whomever
but
-
it shall fall
it will grind to powder
him
And
having heard
184863	the
chief priests
and
184867	the
Pharisees
184870	the
184872	parables
of Him
they knew
that
184877	about
them
He speaks
And
seeking
Him
to lay hold of
they feared
184886	the
crowds
because
184890	as
a prophet
Him
they were holding
And
answering
184897	-
Jesus
again
spoke
184902	in
parables
to them
saying
Has become like
184908	the
184910	kingdom
184912	of the
heavens
to a man
a king
who
made
a wedding feast
184920	for the
184922	son
of him
And
he sent
184927	the
184929	servants
of him
to call
those
having been invited
184935	to
184937	the
wedding feast
and
not
they were willing
to come
Again
he sent
184946	other
servants
saying
Say
to those
having been invited
Behold
184954	the
184956	dinner
of me
I have prepared
184960	the
184962	oxen
of Me
and
184966	the
fatlings
have been killed
and
all things [are]
ready
come
184974	to
184976	the
wedding feast
-
And
having paid no attention
they went away
one
-
184985	to
184987	the
184989	own
field
one
then
184994	to
184996	the
184998	business
of him
185001	-
And
the rest
having laid hold of
185006	the
185008	servants
of him
mistreated
and
killed [them]
185014	-
And
the king
was angry
and
having sent
185021	the
185023	armies
of him
he destroyed
185028	the
murderers
those
and
185033	the
185035	city
of them
he burned
Then
he says
185041	to
185043	servants
of him
185046	The
indeed
wedding feast
ready
is
those
however
having been invited
not
were
worthy
Go
therefore
185060	into
185062	the
185064	thoroughfares
185066	of the
highways
and
as many as
if
you shall find
invite
185074	to
185076	the
wedding feast
And
having gone out
185082	the
servants
those
185086	into
185088	the
highways
they brought together
185092	all
as many as
they found
evil
both
and
good
and
became full
185102	the
wedding hall
of those reclining
Having entered in
then
185108	the
king
to see
those
reclining
he beheld
there
185116	a man
not
being dressed
185120	in clothes
of wedding
and
he says
to him
Friend
how
did you enter
here
not
having
185132	garment
of wedding
-
And
he was speechless
Then
185139	the
king
said
185143	to the
servants
Having bound
185147	his
feet
and
hands
cast out
him
185154	into
185156	the
185158	darkness
185160	-
outer
there
will be
185165	the
weeping
and
185169	the
185171	gnashing
185173	of the
teeth
Many
for
are
called
few
however
chosen
Then
having gone out
185185	the
Pharisees
counsel
took
how
Him
they might trap
185193	in
His words
And
they send
to Him
185199	the
185201	disciples
of them
185204	with
185206	the
Herodians
saying
Teacher
we know
that
true
You are
and
185216	the
185218	way
185220	-
of God
185223	in
[the] truth
You teach
and
not
there is care
to You
185231	about
no one
not
for
You look
185237	on [the]
185239	appearance
of men
Tell
therefore
us
what
You
think
Is it lawful
to give
tribute
to Caesar
or
not
Having known
however
185256	-
Jesus
185259	the
185261	malice
of them
He said
Why
Me
do you test
hypocrites
Show
Me
185271	the
185273	coin
185275	of the
tribute
-
And
they presented
to Him
a denarius
And
He says
to them
Whose [is]
185288	the
likeness
this
And
185293	whose
inscription
They say
Caesarâs
Then
He says
to them
Give back
therefore
185303	the things
of Caesar
to Caesar
and
185308	the things
185310	-
of God
185313	-
to God
And
having heard
they marveled
and
having left
Him
they went away
185323	On
185325	that
185327	-
day
came
to Him
185332	Sadducees
those saying
not
there is
a resurrection
and
they questioned
Him
saying
Teacher
Moses
said
If
anyone
should die
not
having
children
will marry
185352	the
185354	brother
of him
185357	the
185359	wife
of him
and
he will raise up
offspring
185365	for the
185367	brother
of him
There were
now
185372	among
us
185375	seven
brothers
and
185379	the
first
having married
died
and
not
having
seed
he left
185389	the
185391	wife
of him
185394	to the
185396	brother
of him
Likewise
also
185401	the
second
and
185405	the
third
185408	unto
185410	the
seventh
185413	Last
then
of all
died
185418	the
woman
185421	In
185423	the
resurrection
therefore
185428	of which
185430	of the
seven
will she be
wife
All
for
had
her
Answering
now
185441	-
Jesus
said
to them
You err
not
knowing
185449	the
Scriptures
nor
185453	the
185455	power
185457	-
of God
185460	In
for
185463	the
resurrection
neither
do they marry
nor
are given in marriage
but
185471	like
185473	angels
185475	in
185477	-
heaven
they are
185481	Concerning
now
185484	the
185486	resurrection
185488	of the
dead
not
have you read
that which
has been spoken
to you
185496	by
185498	-
God
saying
I
am
185504	the
185506	God
of Abraham
and
185510	the
185512	God
of Isaac
and
185516	the
185518	God
of Jacob
Not
He is
185523	the
185525	God
of [the] dead
but
of [the] living
And
having heard
185532	the
crowds
were astonished
185536	at
185538	the
185540	teaching
of Him
185543	-
And
the Pharisees
having heard
that
He had silenced
185550	the
Sadducees
were gathered
185554	together
185556	the
same
And
questioned [Him]
185561	one
185563	of
them
a lawyer
testing
Him
Teacher
which
185572	commandment
[is the] greatest
185575	in
185577	the
law
-
And
He said
to him
You shall love
[the] Lord
185586	the
185588	God
of you
185591	with
185593	all
185595	the
185597	heart
of you
and
185601	with
185603	all
185605	the
185607	soul
of you
and
185611	with
185613	all
185615	the
185617	mind
of you
This
is
185622	the
185624	great
and
first
commandment
[The] second
[is] like
it
You shall love
185633	the
185635	neighbor
of you
as
yourself
185640	On
185642	these
185644	-
185646	two
commandments
185649	all
185651	the
law
hangs
and
185656	the
Prophets
Having been assembled together
now
185661	the
Pharisees
questioned
them
185666	-
Jesus
saying
What
you
think
185673	concerning
185675	the
Christ
185678	Of whom
son
is He
They say
to Him
185684	-
Of David
He says
to them
How
then
David
185692	in
spirit
does call
Him
Lord
saying
Said
the Lord
185701	to the
185703	Lord
of me
Sit
185707	on
185709	[the] right hand
of Me
until
-
I place
185715	the
185717	enemies
of You
185720	[as] a footstool
185722	for the
185724	feet
of You
If
therefore
David
calls
Him
Lord
how
185734	son
of him
is He
And
no one
was able
to answer
Him
a word
nor
dared
anyone
185747	from
185749	that
185751	-
day
to question
Him
no longer
Then
185758	-
Jesus
spoke
185762	to the
crowds
and
185766	to
185768	disciples
of Him
saying
185772	On
185774	-
185776	Mosesâ
seat
have sat down
185780	the
scribes
and
185784	the
Pharisees
185787	All things
therefore
how many
if
they might tell
you
keep
and
observe
185797	After
however
185800	the
185802	works
of them
not
do
They speak
for
and
not
act
They tie up
-
185814	burdens
heavy
and
lay [them]
185819	on
185821	the
185823	shoulders
185825	-
of men
themselves
however
185830	with
185832	finger
of them
not
are they willing
to move
them
185839	All
now
185842	the
185844	deeds
of them
they do
185848	in order
-
to be seen
185852	-
by men
They broaden
for
185857	the
185859	phylacteries
of them
and
enlarge
185864	their
tassels
They love
now
185869	the
185871	chief place
185873	at
185875	the
banquets
and
185879	the
185881	first seats
185883	in
185885	the
synagogues
and
185889	the
185891	greetings
185893	in
185895	the
marketplaces
and
to be called
185900	by
185902	-
men
Rabbi
You
however
not
shall be called
Rabbi
One

185939	of you
185941	the
Father
185944	who [is]

Neither

instructors
since
185951	[the] instructor
of you
is
One
185956	the
Christ
185959	-
And
185962	the greatest
among you
will be
185966	your
servant
He who
then
shall exalt
himself

and
whoever
shall humble
himself
will be exalted
Woe
however
to you

hypocrites
For
you shut up
185988	the

185995	before
185997	-

neither
enter
nor even
those who
are entering
do you allow
to go in
Woe
to you

For
you traverse
186017	the
sea
and
186021	the
dry [land]
to make
one
convert
and
when
he has become [so]
you make
him
186033	a son
of hell
186036	twofold more
than yourselves
Woe
to you

shall swear
186049	by
186051	the

For
you are like
186313	tombs
having been whitewashed

indeed
appear
beautiful
Inside
however
they are full

186332	also
you
outwardly

you are
full

For
you build

adorn
186366	the
186368	monuments
186370	of the
righteous
and
you say
If
we had lived
186377	in
186379	the
186381	days
186383	of the
186385	fathers
of us
not
-
we would have been
186391	with them
partakers
186394	in
186396	the
186398	blood
186400	of the
prophets
Thus
you bear witness
to yourselves
that
186407	sons
you are
of those
having murdered
186412	the
prophets
And
you
fill up
186418	the
186420	measure
186422	of the
186424	fathers
of you
Serpents
186428	Offspring
of vipers
How
shall you escape
186433	from
186435	the
186437	sentence
186439	-
of hell
186442	Because of
this
behold
I
send
186448	to
you
prophets
and
wise [men]
and
scribes
186456	Some of
them
you will kill
and
will crucify
and [some]
186463	of
them
you will flog
186467	in
186469	the
186471	synagogues
of you
and
will persecute
186476	from
town
186479	to
town
so that
shall come
186484	upon
you
186487	all [the]
186489	blood
righteous
being poured out
186493	upon
186495	the
earth
186498	from
186500	the
186502	blood
of Abel
186505	the
righteous
186508	to
186510	the
186512	blood
of Zechariah
186515	son
of Berekiah
whom
you murdered
186520	between
186522	the
temple
and
186526	the
altar
Truly
I say
to you
will come
186533	these things
all
186536	upon
186539	the
generation
this
Jerusalem
Jerusalem
-
killing
186547	the
prophets
and
stoning
those
having been sent
186554	to
her
How often
would I
have gathered together
186560	the
186562	children
of you
186565	in which
way
a hen
gathers together
186570	the
186572	chicks
of her
186575	under
186577	the
wings
and
not
you were willing
Behold
is left
to you
186586	the
186588	house
of you
I say
for
to you
186594	no
not
Me
shall you see
186599	from
now
until
-
you say
Blessed [is]
the [One]
coming
186608	in [the]
186610	name
of [the] Lord
And
having gone forth
186615	-
Jesus
186618	from
186620	the
temple
He was going away
and
came to [Him]
186626	the
186628	disciples
of Him
to point out
to Him
186633	the
186635	buildings
186637	of the
temple
-
And
answering
He said
to them
Not
do you see
186647	these things
all
Truly
I say
to you
186653	none
not even
shall be left
here
stone
186659	upon
stone
which
not
will be thrown down
[As] was sitting
now
He
186668	upon
186670	the
186672	Mount
186674	-
of Olives
came to
Him
186679	the
disciples
186682	in
private
saying
Tell
us
when
these things
will be
And
what [is]
186693	the
186695	sign
186697	-
186699	of Your
coming
and
186703	of the consummation
186705	of the
age
And
answering
186710	-
Jesus
said
to them
Take heed
lest
anyone
you
mislead
Many
for
will come
186723	in
186725	the
186727	name
of Me
saying
I
am
186733	the
Christ
and
many
they will mislead
You will begin
then
to hear of
wars
and
186744	rumors
of wars
Behold
not
be alarmed
it is necessary
for
to take place
but
not yet
is
186756	the
end
Will rise up
for
nation
186762	against
nation
and
kingdom
186767	against
kingdom
and
there will be
famines
and
earthquakes
186775	in
[various] places
186778	All
then
these [are]
186782	[the] beginning
of birth pains
Then
will they deliver
you
186788	to
tribulation
and
will kill
you
and
186795	you will be
hated
186798	by
186800	all
186802	the
nations
186805	on account of
186807	the
186809	name
of Me
And
then
will fall away
many
and
one another
they will betray
and
will hate
one another
and
186823	many
false prophets
will arise
and
will mislead
many
And
186831	because
-
is to be multiplied
186835	-
lawlessness
will grow cold
186839	the
186841	love
186843	of the
many
The [one]
however
having endured
186849	to [the]
end
he
will be saved
And
there will be proclaimed
186856	this
186858	-
186860	gospel
186862	of the
kingdom
186865	in
186867	all
186869	the
earth
186872	for
a testimony
186875	to all
186877	the
nations
and
then
will come
186883	the
end
When
therefore
you shall see
186889	the
186891	abomination
186893	-
of desolation
-
having been spoken of
186898	by
Daniel
186901	the
prophet
standing
186905	in [the]
186907	place
holy
the [one]
reading
let him understand
then
186914	those
186916	in
186918	-
Judea
let them flee
186922	to
186924	the
mountains
186927	the [one]
186929	on
186931	the
housetop
not
let him come down
to take
186937	anything
186939	out of
186941	the
186943	house
of him
and
186947	the [one]
186949	in
186951	the
field
neither
let him return
back
to take
186958	the
186960	cloak
of him
Woe
then
to those
186966	in
womb
having
and
to the [ones]
nursing infants
186973	in
186975	those
186977	the
days
Pray
however
that
not
might be
186985	the
186987	flight
of you
in winter
nor
on a Sabbath
There will be
for
then
186996	tribulation
great
such as
not
has been
187002	from [the]
187004	beginning
of [the] world
187007	until
187009	-
now
no
187013	never
not
shall be
And
if
not
had been shortened
187022	the
days
those
not
-
there would have been saved
187029	any
flesh
187032	because of
however
187035	the
elect
will be shortened
187040	the
days
those
Then
if
anyone
to you
says
Behold
here [is]
187051	the
Christ
or
Here
not
believe [it]
There will arise
for
false Christs
and
false prophets
and
they will give
187065	signs
great
and
wonders
so as
to mislead
if
possible
187074	even
187076	the
elect
Behold
I have foretold [it]
to you
If
therefore
they say
to you
Behold
187087	in
187089	the
wilderness
He is
not
go forth
[or] âBehold
187096	in
187098	the
inner rooms
not
believe [it]
Just as
for
187105	the
lightning
comes forth
187109	from [the]
east
and
shines
187114	as far as [the]
west
so
will be
187119	the
187121	coming
187123	of the
187125	Son
187127	-
of Man
For wherever
if
may be
187133	the
carcass
there
will be gathered
187138	the
vultures
Immediately
then
187143	after
187145	the
187147	tribulation
187150	the
days
of those
187154	The
sun
will be darkened
and
187159	the
moon
not
will give
187164	the
187166	light
of it
and
187170	the
stars
will fall
187174	from
187176	the
sky
and
187180	the
187182	powers
187184	of the
heavens
will be shaken
And
then
will appear
187191	the
187193	sign
187195	of the
187197	Son
187199	-
of Man
187202	in
heaven
and
then
will mourn
187208	all
187210	the
187212	tribes
187214	of the
earth
and
they will see
187219	the
187221	Son
187223	-
of Man
coming
187227	on
187229	the
187231	clouds
187233	-
of heaven
187236	with
187238	power
and
glory
great
And
He will send
187245	the
187247	angels
of Him
187250	with
187252	a trumpet call
great
and
they will gather together
187257	the
187259	elect
of Him
187262	from
187264	the
187266	four
winds
187269	from
187271	[the] ends
of the heavens
187274	to
187276	ends
of them
187279	Of
now
187282	the
fig tree
learn
187286	the
parable
When
already
187291	the
187293	branch
of it
may have become
tender
and
187299	the
leaves
it puts forth
you know
that
near [is]
187306	the
summer
Thus
also
you
when
you see
187314	all
these things
know
that
near
He is
187321	at
[the] doors
Truly
I say
to you
that
187328	no
not
will have passed away
187333	the
generation
this
until
-
187339	all
these things
shall have taken place
187343	The
heaven
and
187347	the
earth
will pass away
187351	-
but
187354	the words
of Me
187357	no
not
shall pass away
187361	Concerning
however
187365	the
day
that
and
hour
no one
knows
not even
187374	the
187376	angels
187378	of the
heavens
nor
187382	the
Son
if
not
187387	the
Father
only
As [were]
for
187393	the
187395	days
187397	-
of Noah
so
will be
187402	the
187404	coming
187406	of the
187408	Son
187410	-
of Man
As
for
187415	they were
187417	in
187420	the
days
those
187424	-
187426	before
187428	the
flood
eating
and
drinking
marrying
and
giving in marriage
187437	until
187439	that
day
entered
Noah
187444	into
187446	the
ark
And
not
they knew
until
came
187454	the
flood
and
took away
all
thus
will be
187462	also
187464	the
187466	coming
187468	of the
187470	Son
187472	-
of Man
Then
will be
two
187478	in
187480	the
field
one
is taken
and
one
is left
Two [women]
will be grinding
187490	at
187492	the
mill
one
is taken
and
one
is left
Keep watch
therefore
for
not
you know
187505	on what
day
187508	the
187510	Lord
of you
comes
This
then
know
that
if
had known
187520	the
master of the house
187523	in what
time of night
187526	the
thief
comes
he would have watched
-
and
not
-
have allowed
to be broken into
187537	the
187539	house
of him
187542	Because of
this
187545	also
you
be
ready
for
in that
not
you expect
hour
187555	the
187557	Son
187559	-
of Man
comes
Who
then
is
187566	the
187568	faithful
servant
and
wise
whom
has set
187575	the
master
187578	over
187580	the
187582	household
of him
-
to give
to them
187588	the
food
187591	in
season
Blessed [is]
187596	the
servant
that
whom
having come
187602	the
187604	master
of him
will find
thus
doing
Truly
I say
to you
that
187614	over
187616	all
187618	the
possessing
of him
he will set
him
If
however
should say
187628	the
187630	evil
servant
that
187634	in
187636	the
187638	heart
of him
Delays
187642	of Me
187644	the
master
and
should begin
to beat
187650	the
187652	fellow servants
of him
to eat
then
and
to drink
187659	with
those
being drunkards
will come
187664	the
187666	master
187669	the
servant
of that
187673	in
a day
in which
not
he does expect
and
187680	in
an hour
which
not
he is aware
and
will cut in pieces
him
and
187690	the
187692	place
of him
187695	with
187697	the
hypocrites
will appoint
there
will be
187703	the
weeping
and
187707	the
187709	gnashing
187711	of
teeth
Then
will be likened
187716	the
187718	kingdom
187720	of the
heavens
187723	to ten
virgins
who
having taken
187728	the
187730	lamps
of them
went forth
187734	to
187736	meet
187738	the
bridegroom
187741	Five
now
187744	of
them
were
foolish
and
five
wise
187752	The
for
foolish
having taken
187757	the
lamps
not
did take
187762	with
them
oil
187766	-
but
the wise
took
oil
187772	in
187774	the
vessels
187777	with
187779	the
187781	lamps
of them
Tarrying
then
187786	the
bridegroom
they became drowsy
all
and
were sleeping
187793	At middle
then
of [the] night
a cry
there was
Behold
187800	the
bridegroom
Go forth
187804	to
meet
Then
arose
187810	all
187812	the
virgins
those
and
trimmed
187818	the
187820	lamps
of them
187823	-
And
the foolish
187827	to the
wise
said
Give
us
187833	of
187835	the
187837	oil
of you
for
187841	the
187843	lamps
of us
are going out
Answered
then
187849	the
wise
saying
Lest
-
187855	no
not even
it might suffice
for us
and
you
Go
rather
187864	to
those
selling
and
buy
for yourselves
[While] are going away
then
they
to buy
came
187876	the
bridegroom
and
187880	those
ready
went in
187884	with
him
187887	to
187889	the
wedding feast
and
was shut
187894	the
door
Afterward
then
come
187900	also
187902	the
187904	other
virgins
saying
Lord
Lord
open
to us
-
And
answering
he said
Truly
I say
to you
not
I do know
you
Watch
therefore
for
neither
do you know
187927	the
day
nor
187931	the
hour
[It is] like
for
a man
going on a journey
[who] called
187939	the
187941	own
servants
and
delivered
to them
187947	the
possessing
of him
And
to one
indeed
he gave
187955	five
talents
to one
then
two
to one
then
one
to each
187965	according to
187967	the
187969	own
ability
and
he left the region
immediately
Having gone
the [one]
187977	the
187979	five
talents
having received
traded
187984	with
them
and
made
187989	more
five
Likewise
the [one with]
187994	the
two
gained
187998	more
two
The [one]
however
188003	-
one
having received
having gone away
dug in
the ground
and
hid
188012	the
188014	money
188016	of the
188018	master
of him
188021	After
then
188024	much
time
comes
188028	the
188030	master
188033	of the
servants
those
and
takes
account
188040	with
them
And
having come
the [one]
188046	the
188048	five
talents
having received
brought to [him]
188053	other
188055	five
talents
saying
Master
188060	five
talents
to me
you did deliver
Behold
188066	more
188068	five
talents
have I gained
Said
to him
188074	the
188076	master
of Him
Well done
188080	servant
good
and
faithful
188085	Over
a few things
you were
faithful
188090	over
many things
you
will I set
Enter
188096	into
188098	the
188100	joy
188102	of the
188104	master
of you
Having come
188108	also
the [one]
188111	with the
188113	two
talents
he said
Master
188118	two
talents
to me
you did deliver
Behold
188124	more
188126	two
talents
have I gained
Said
to him
188132	the
188134	master
of Him
Well done
188138	servant
good
and
faithful
188143	Over
a few things
you were
faithful
188148	over
many things
you
will I set
Enter
188154	into
188156	the
188158	joy
188160	of the
188162	master
of you
Having come
then
188167	also
the [one]
188170	the
188172	one
talent
having received
he said
Master
I knew
you
that
188181	hard
you are
188184	a man
reaping
where
not
you did sow
and
gathering
from where
not
you did scatter
And
having been afraid
having gone away
I hid
188199	the
188201	talent
of you
188204	in
188206	the
ground
Behold
you have
188211	what [is]
yours
Answering
now
188216	the
188218	master
of him
said
to him
188223	Wicked
servant
and
lazy
You knew
that
I reap
where
not
I sowed
and
gather
from where
not
I scattered
It behooved
you
therefore
to put
188243	the
188245	money
of me
188248	to the
bankers
and
having come
I
would have received
-
188256	-
my own
188259	with
interest
Take
therefore
188264	from
him
188267	the
talent
and
give [it]
to the [one]
having
188274	the
188276	ten
talents
188279	-
For
having
to everyone
will be given
and
he will have in abundance
the [one]
however
not
having
188291	even
that which
he has
will be taken away
188296	from
him
And
188300	the
188302	worthless
servant
cast out
188306	into
188308	the
188310	darkness
188312	-
outer
there
will be
188317	the
weeping
and
188321	the
188323	gnashing
188325	of the
teeth
When
then
comes
188331	the
188333	Son
188335	-
of Man
188338	in
188340	the
188342	glory
of Him
and
188346	all
188348	the
angels
188351	with
Him
then
He will sit
188356	upon [the]
188358	throne
188360	of glory
of Him
And
will be gathered
188365	before
Him
188368	all
188370	the
nations
and
He will separate
them
188376	from
one another
as
188380	the
shepherd
separates
188384	the
sheep
188387	from
188389	the
goats
And
He will set
188394	-
indeed
the sheep
188398	on
188400	[the] right hand
of Him
188403	-
and
the goats
188407	on
[the] left
Then
will say
188412	the
King
188415	to those
188417	on
188419	[the] right hand
of Him
Come
188423	those
being blessed
188426	of the
188428	Father
of me
inherit
188432	the
188434	having been prepared
for you
kingdom
188438	from [the]
188440	foundation
of [the] world
I hungered
for
and
you gave
Me
to eat
I thirsted
and
you gave to drink
me
a stranger
I was
and
you took in
Me
naked
and
you clothed
Me
I was sick
and
you visited
Me
188466	in
prison
I was
and
you came
188472	to
Me
Then
will answer
Him
188478	the
righteous
saying
Lord
when
You
saw we
hungering
and
fed [You]
Or
thirsting
and
gave [You] to drink
When
now
You
saw we
a stranger
and
took [You] in
Or
naked
and
clothed [You]
When
now
You
saw we
ailing
or
188510	in
prison
and
came
188515	to
You
And
answering
188520	the
King
will say
to them
Truly
I say
to you
188528	to the extent
as much as
you did [it]
188532	to one
188535	of these
188537	the
188539	brothers
of Me
188542	the
least
to Me
you did [it]
Then
will He say
188549	also
188551	to those
188553	on
[the] left
Depart
188557	from
Me
being cursed
188561	into
188563	the
188565	fire
188567	-
eternal
-
having been prepared
188572	for the
devil
and
188576	the
188578	angels
of him
I hungered
for
and
nothing
you gave
to Me
to eat
I thirsted
and
nothing
You gave to drink
Me
a stranger
I was
and
not
You took in
Me
naked
and
not
you did clothe
Me
sick
and
188606	in
prison
and
not
did you visit
Me
Then
will answer
188615	also
themselves
saying
Lord
when
You
saw we
hungering
or
thirsting
or
a stranger
or
naked
or
sick
or
188633	in
prison
and
not
did minister
to You
Then
will He answer
them
saying
Truly
I say
to you
188647	to the extent
that
not
you did [it]
188652	to one
188654	of these
188656	the
least
neither
to Me
did you
And
will go away
these
188665	into
188667	punishment
eternal
188670	-
but
the righteous
188674	into
188676	life
eternal
And
it came to pass
when
had finished
188683	-
Jesus
188687	all
188689	the
words
these
He said
188694	to the
188696	disciples
of Him
You know
that
188701	after
188703	two
days
188706	the
Passover
takes place
and
188711	the
188713	Son
188715	-
of Man
is delivered
188719	over
-
to be crucified
Then
were gathered together
188725	the
chief priests
and
188729	the
188731	elders
188733	of the
people
188736	in
188738	the
188740	courtyard
188742	of the
high priest
who
is called
Caiaphas
and
they plotted together
in order that
188751	-
Jesus
by guile
they might seize
and
kill
They were saying
however
Not
188761	during
188763	the
feast
that
not
a riot
there be
188770	among
188772	the
people
188775	-
And
of Jesus
having been
188780	in
Bethany
188783	in [the]
188785	house
of Simon
188788	the
leper
came
to Him
a woman
having
188795	an alabaster flask
188797	fragrant oil
very costly
and
poured [it]
188802	on
188804	the
head
of Him
[as] He is reclining
Having seen
then
188811	the
disciples
became indignant
saying
188816	For what
purpose
188820	[is] the
waste
this
Could
for
this
have been sold
for much
and
have been given
to [the] poor
Having known [this]
now
188834	-
Jesus
said
to them
Why
trouble
do you cause
188842	to the
woman
188845	A work
for
beautiful
she did
188850	to
Me
Always
for
188855	the
poor
you have
188859	with
you
Me
however
not
always
you have
In pouring
for
this [woman]
188871	the
fragrant oil
this
188875	on
188877	the
188879	body
of Me
188882	for
the
burial
of Me
she did [it]
Truly
I say
to you
wherever
if
shall be proclaimed
188895	the
gospel
this
188899	in
188901	all
188903	the
world
will be spoken of
188907	also
that which
did
this [woman]
188912	for
188914	a memorial
of her
Then
having gone
188919	one
188921	of the
Twelve
the [one]
being called
Judas
Iscariot
188928	to
188930	the
chief priests
he said
What
are you willing
me
to give
and I
to you
will betray
Him
-
And
they appointed
to him
188946	thirty
pieces of silver
And
188950	from
that time
he was seeking
an opportunity
that
Him
he might betray
188958	On the
now
188961	first [day]
188963	of the
unleavened [bread]
came
188967	the
disciples
188970	-
to Jesus
saying
Where
wish you [that]
we should prepare
for You
to eat
188979	the
Passover
-
And
He said
Go
188986	into
188988	the
city
188991	unto
188993	a
certain man
and
tell
him
188999	the
Teacher
says
189003	The
189005	time
of Me
near
is
189010	with
you
I will keep
189014	the
Passover
189017	with
189019	the
189021	disciples
of Me
And
did
189026	the
disciples
as
directed
them
189032	-
Jesus
and
prepared
189037	the
Passover
Evening
now
having arrived
He was reclining
189044	with
189046	the
189048	twelve
disciples
And [as]
they were eating
to them
He said
Truly
I say
to you
that
189059	one
189061	of
you
will betray
Me
And
being grieved
exceedingly
they began
to say
to Him
189072	one
each
Not
I
is it
Lord
-
And
answering
He said
The [one]
having dipped
189085	with
Me
189088	the
hand
189091	in
189093	the
dish
he
Me
will betray
189099	-
Indeed
189102	the Son
189104	-
of Man
goes
as
it has been written
189110	about
Him
woe
however
189116	-
the man
to that
189120	by
whom
189123	the
189125	Son
189127	-
of Man
is betrayed
Better
would it be
for him
if
not
had been born
189138	the
man
that
Answering
now
Judas
who
was betraying
Him
said
Not
I
is it
Rabbi
He says
to him
You
have said
[As] they were eating
now
of them
having taken
189161	-
Jesus
bread
and
having blessed
broke [it]
and
having given
189170	to the
disciples
He said
Take
eat
this
is
189178	the
189180	body
of Me
And
having taken
a cup
and
having given thanks
He gave [it]
to them
saying
Drink
189192	of
it
all of you
This
for
is
189199	the
189202	blood
of Me
189205	of the
covenant
-
189209	for
many
being poured out
189213	for
189215	forgiveness
of sins
I say
now
to you
189221	no
not
will I drink
189225	from
now
189228	of
189230	this
189232	the
189234	fruit
189236	of the
vine
189239	until
189242	the
day
that
when
it
I drink
189249	with
you
anew
189253	in
189255	the
189257	kingdom
189259	of the
189261	Father
of Me
And
having sung a hymn
they went out
189267	to
189269	the
189271	Mount
189273	-
of Olives
Then
says
to them
189279	-
Jesus
189282	All
you
will fall away
189286	because of
Me
189289	during
189292	the
night
this
It has been written
for
I will strike
189299	the
shepherd
and
will be scattered
189304	the
189306	sheep
189308	of the
flock
189311	After
however
-
being raised
I
will go before
you
189319	into
189321	-
Galilee
Answering
now
189326	-
Peter
said
to Him
If
all
will fall away
189334	because of
You
I
never
will fall away
Said
to him
189342	-
Jesus
Truly
I say
to you
that
189349	during
189351	this
189353	-
night
before [the]
rooster
crowing
three times
you will deny
Me
Says
to Him
189364	-
Peter
Even if
it were necessary for
me
189370	with
You
to die
189374	no
not
You
will I deny
Likewise
189380	also
189382	all
189384	the
disciples
said
Then
comes
189390	with
them
189393	-
Jesus
189396	to
189398	a place
called
Gethsemane
and
He says
189404	to the
disciples
Sit
here
189409	until
that
having gone away
over there
I shall pray
And
having taken with [Him]
189417	-
Peter
and
189421	the
189423	two
189425	sons
of Zebedee
He began
to be sorrowful
and
deeply distressed
Then
He says
to them
Very sorrowful
is
189437	the
189439	soul
of Me
189442	even to
death
remain
here
and
watch
189449	with
Me
And
having gone forward
a little
He fell
189456	upon
189458	face
of Him
praying
and
saying
189464	Father
of Me
if
possible
it is
let pass
189471	from
Me
189475	the
cup
this
Nevertheless
not
as
I
will
but
as
You
And
He comes
189489	to
189491	the
disciples
and
finds
them
sleeping
And
He says
189500	-
to Peter
Thus
not
were you able
189506	one
hour
to watch
189510	with
Me
Watch
and
pray
that
not
you enter
189519	into
temptation
189522	The
indeed
spirit
[is] willing
189527	-
but
the flesh
weak
Again
189533	for
a second time
having gone away
He prayed
saying
189539	Father
of Me
if
not
is possible
this
to pass
if
not
it
I drink
be done
189552	the
189554	will
of You
And
having come
again
He finds
them
sleeping
189563	were
for
189566	of them
189568	the
eyes
heavy
And
having left
them
again
having gone away
He prayed
189578	for
[the] third time
189581	the
189583	same
thing
having said
again
Then
He comes
189590	to
189592	the
disciples
and
says
to them
Sleep
later on
and
take your rest
Behold
has drawn near
189604	the
hour
and
189608	the
189610	Son
189612	-
of Man
is betrayed
189616	into
189618	[the] hands
of sinners
Rise up
let us go
Behold
has drawn near
he who
is betraying
Me
And
yet
of Him
as He is speaking
behold
Judas
189634	one
189636	of the
Twelve
came
and
189641	with
him
189646	a crowd
great
189649	with
swords
and
clubs
189654	from
189656	the
chief priests
and
189660	elders
189662	of the
people
The [one]
then
betraying
Him
gave
them
a sign
saying
Whomever
-
I shall kiss
He
it is
seize
Him
And
immediately
having come up
189683	-
to Jesus
he said
Greetings
Rabbi
and
kissed
Him
189692	-
And
Jesus
said
to him
Friend
189699	for
what
are you come
Then
having come to [him]
they laid
189706	-
hands
189709	on
189711	-
Jesus
and
seized
Him
And
behold
189719	one
189721	of those
189723	with
Jesus
having stretched out
189727	the
hand
drew
189731	the
189733	sword
of him
and
having struck
189738	the
189740	servant
189742	of the
high priest
cut off
189746	of him
189748	the
ear
Then
says
to him
189754	-
Jesus
Return
189758	the
189760	sword
of you
189763	into
189765	the
189767	place
of it
189770	all
for
those
having taken
[the] sword
189776	by
[the] sword
will perish
Or
think you
that
not
I am able
to call upon
189786	the
189788	Father
of Me
and
He will furnish
to Me
presently
189795	more than
189797	twelve
189799	legions
of angels
How
then
should be fulfilled
189805	the
Scriptures
that
so
it must
be
189812	In
189814	that
189816	-
hour
said
189820	-
Jesus
189823	to the
crowds
As
189827	against
a robber
did you come out
189831	with
swords
and
clubs
to capture
Me
189838	Every
day
189841	in
189843	the
temple
I was sitting
teaching
and
not
you did seize
Me
189852	This
then
all
is come to pass
that
might be fulfilled
189859	the
189861	Scriptures
189863	of the
prophets
Then
189868	the
disciples
all
having forsaken
Him
fled
Those
then
having seized
189878	-
Jesus
led [Him] away
189882	to
Caiaphas
189885	the
high priest
where
189889	the
scribes
and
189893	the
elders
were assembled
189897	-
And
Peter
was following
Him
189903	from
afar
189906	even
189908	to the
189910	court
189912	of the
high priest
And
having entered
within
he was sitting
189919	with
189921	the
guards
to see
189925	the
outcome
189928	-
And
the chief priests
and
189934	the
Council
whole
were seeking
false testimony
189940	against
189942	-
Jesus
so that
him
they might put to death
but
not any
they found
189951	of many
having come forward as
false witnesses
At last
then
having come forward
two
they said
This [man]
has been saying
I am able
to destroy
189964	the
189966	temple
189968	-
of God
and
189972	in
189974	three
days
to rebuild it
And
having stood up
189980	the
high priest
said
to Him
Nothing
answer you
What
these
you
do witness against
189991	-
And
Jesus
was silent
And
189997	the
high priest
said
to Him
I adjure
you
190004	by
190006	-
God
the
living
that
us
You tell
if
You
are
190017	the
Christ
190020	the
190022	Son
190024	-
of God
Says
to him
190029	-
Jesus
You
have said
But
I say
to you
190037	from
now
you will see
190041	the
190043	Son
190045	-
of Man
sitting
190049	at
190051	[the] right hand
190053	-
of Power
and
coming
190058	upon
190060	the
190062	clouds
190064	-
of heaven
Then
190068	the
high priest
tears
190072	the
190074	garments
of him
saying
He has blasphemed
why
any more
190081	need
have we
of witnesses
Behold
now
you have heard
190088	the
blasphemy
What
you
do think
-
And
answering
they said
Deserving
of death
He is
Then
they spat
190103	in
190105	the
190107	face
of Him
and
struck
Him
Others
then
slapped [Him]
saying
Prophesy
to us
Christ
who
is
the [one]
having struck
You
190125	-
And
Peter
was sitting
outside
190131	in
190133	the
court
and
came
to him
190139	one
servant girl
saying
190143	Also
You
were
190147	with
Jesus
190150	the
Galilean
-
And
he denied
190156	before
all
saying
Not
I know
what
you say
Having gone out
then
190166	to
190168	the
porch
saw
him
another [servant girl]
and
says
190176	to those
there
This [man]
was
190181	with
Jesus
190184	of
Nazareth
And
again
he denied
190190	with
an oath
-
Not
I know
190196	the
man
190199	After
a little while
also
having come to [him]
those
standing by
they said
190207	-
to Peter
Surely
190211	also
you
190214	of
them
are
190218	even
for
190221	the
190223	speech
of you
away
you
gives
Then
he began
to curse
and
to swear
-
Not
I know
190237	the
man
And
immediately
a rooster
crowed
And
remembered
190246	-
Peter
190249	the
190251	word
190253	of Jesus
He having said
-
Before [the]
rooster
crowing
three times
you will deny
Me
And
having gone
out
he wept
bitterly
Morning
then
having arrived
counsel
took
190273	all
190275	the
chief priests
and
190279	the
190281	elders
190283	of the
people
190286	against
190288	-
Jesus
so that
they might put to death
him
And
having bound
Him
they led away [Him]
and
delivered Him to
Pilate
190301	the
governor
Then
having seen
Judas
the [one]
having delivered up
Him
that
He was condemned
having regretted [it]
he returned
190314	the
190316	thirty
pieces of silver
190319	to the
chief priests
and
elders
saying
I sinned
having betrayed
190327	blood
innocent
-
Then
they said
What [is that]
190334	to
us
You
will see
And
having cast down
190341	the
pieces of silver
190344	into
190346	the
temple
he withdrew
and
having gone away
hanged himself
190353	-
And
the chief priests
having taken
190358	the
pieces of silver
said
Not
it is lawful
to put
them
190366	into
190368	the
treasury
since [the]
190372	price
of blood
it is
Counsel
then
having taken
they bought
190380	with
them
190383	the
190385	field
190387	of the
potter
190390	for
190392	a burial place
190394	for the
strangers
Therefore
was called
190400	the
field
that
190404	Field
of Blood
190407	to
190409	-
this day
Then
was fulfilled
that
having been spoken
190416	by
Jeremiah
190419	the
prophet
saying
And
they took
190425	the
190427	thirty
pieces of silver
190430	the
190432	price
of the [One]
having been priced
whom
they set a price on
190438	by [the]
190440	sons
of Israel
and
they gave
them
190446	for
190448	the
190450	field
190452	of the
potter
as
directed
me
[the] Lord
190459	-
And
Jesus
stood
190464	before
190466	the
governor
and
questioned
Him
190472	the
governor
saying
You
are
190478	the
190480	King
190482	of the
Jews
190485	-
And
Jesus
said
You
say
And
190493	in
-
being accused
His
190498	by
190500	the
chief priests
and
elders
nothing
He answered
Then
says
to Him
190510	-
Pilate
Not
do you hear
how many things
You
they witness against
And
not
He did answer
him
190522	to
190524	not even
190526	one
word
so as
to amaze
190531	the
governor
exceedingly
190535	At
now
[the] feast
was accustomed
190540	the
governor
to release
190544	one
190546	to the
multitude
prisoner
whom
they were wishing
They were holding
now
at that time
190556	a prisoner
notable
called
Barabbas
Being gathered together
therefore
of them
said
to them
190566	-
Pilate
Whom
will you [that]
I shall release
to you
Barabbas
or
Jesus
who
is called
Christ
He knew
for
that
190582	through
envy
they delivered up
him
As was sitting
now
he
190590	on
190592	the
judgment seat
sent
190596	to
him
190599	the
190601	wife
of him
saying
[Let there be] nothing
between you
and
190609	the
righteous [man]
that
many things
for
I suffered
today
190617	in
a dream
190620	because of
Him
190623	-
And
the chief priests
and
190628	the
elders
persuaded
190632	the
crowds
that
they should ask for
190637	-
Barabbas
190640	-
and
Jesus
should destroy
Answering
now
190647	the
governor
said
to them
190652	Which
do you desire
190655	of
190657	the
two
I release
to you
-
And
they said
190665	-
Barabbas
Says
to them
190670	-
Pilate
What
then
should I do with
Jesus
who
is called
Christ
They say
all
Let [Him] be crucified
-
And
he said
190686	What
for
evil
did He commit
-
And
all the more
they kept crying out
saying
Let [Him] be crucified
Having seen
now
190699	-
Pilate
that
nothing
it availed
but
rather
a riot
is arising
having taken
water
he washed
190712	the
hands
190715	before
190717	the
crowd
saying
Guiltless
I am
190723	of
190725	the
190727	blood
of this
For yourselves
you will see
And
answering
190734	all
190736	the
people
said
190740	The
190742	blood
of Him
190745	[be] on
us
and
190749	on
190751	the
190753	children
of us
Then
he released
to them
190759	-
Barabbas
190762	-
and
Jesus
having flogged
He delivered up [Him]
that
He might be crucified
Then
190771	the
190773	soldiers
190775	of the
governor
having taken with [them]
190779	-
Jesus
190782	to
190784	the
Praetorium
gathered
190788	before
Him
190791	all
190793	the
cohort
And
having stripped
Him
190799	a robe
scarlet
they put around
Him
And
having twisted together
a crown
190807	of
thorns
they put [it]
190811	on
190813	the
190815	head
of Him
and
a reed
190820	in
190822	the
190824	right hand
of Him
and
having bowed the knees
190829	before
Him
they mocked
Him
saying
Hail
190836	King
190838	of the
Jews
And
having spit
190843	upon
Him
they took
190847	the
reed
and
kept striking [Him]
190852	on
190854	the
190856	head
of Him
And
when
they had mocked
Him
they took off
Him
190865	the
robe
and
they put on
Him
190871	the
190873	garments
of Him
and
led away
Him
190879	to
-
crucify [Him]
Going forth
now
they found
190886	a man
of Cyrene
named
Simon
Him
they compelled
that
he might carry
190895	the
190897	cross
of Him
And
having come
190902	to
190904	a place
called
Golgotha
which
190909	is
190911	of a Skull
Place
called
they gave
Him
to drink
190918	wine
190920	with
gall
mingled
and
having tasted
not
He was willing
to drink [it]
Having crucified
now
Him
they divided
190933	the
190935	garments
of Him
casting
lots
And
sitting down
they were guarding
Him
there
And
they put up
190947	over
190949	the
190951	head
of Him
190954	the
190957	accusation
of Him
written
This
is
Jesus
190964	the
190966	King
190968	of the
Jews
At the same time
are crucified
190973	with
Him
190976	two
robbers
one
190980	at [the]
right hand
and
one
190985	at [the]
left
Those
now
passing by
kept railing at
Him
wagging
190994	the
190996	heads
of them
and
saying
The [One]
destroying
191003	the
temple
and
191007	in
191009	three
days
building [it]
save
Yourself
If
191016	[the] Son
You are
191019	-
of God
also
descend
191024	from
191026	the
cross
Likewise
191030	the
chief priests
mocking
191034	with
191036	the
scribes
and
elders
were saying
Others
He saved
Himself
not
is He able
to save
191048	King
of Israel
He is
Let Him descend
now
191054	from
191056	the
cross

And
likewise
191086	even
191088	the
robbers
those
having been crucified
191093	with
Him
were upbraiding

Evening
now
having arrived
came
191363	a man
rich
191366	from
Arimathea
named
Joseph
who
191372	also
himself
was discipled
191376	-
to Jesus
He
having gone
191381	-
to Pilate
asked for
191385	the
191387	body
191389	-
of Jesus
Then
191393	-
Pilate
commanded it
to be given up
And
having taken
191400	the
body
191403	-
Joseph
wrapped
it
191408	in
191410	a linen cloth
clean
and
placed
it
191416	in
191418	the
191420	new
191422	of him
tomb
which
he had cut
191427	in
191429	the
rock
and
having rolled
191434	a stone
great
191437	to the
191439	door
191441	of the
tomb
he went away
191445	Was
now
there
Mary
191450	-

191465	-
And
the next day
which
is
191471	after
191473	the
Preparation
were gathered together
191477	the
chief priests
and
191481	the
Pharisees
191484	before
Pilate
saying
Sir
we have remembered
how
191491	that
191493	-
deceiver
said
while
living
191499	After
191501	three
days
I arise
Command
therefore
to be secured
191508	the
tomb
191511	until
191513	the
191515	third
day
lest
ever
having come
191521	the
disciples
steal away
him
and
say
191528	to the
people
He is risen
191532	from
191534	the
dead
And
will be
191539	the
191541	last
deception
worse
191545	than the
first
Said
to them
191550	-
Pilate
You have
a guard
Go
make [it as] secure
as
you know [how]
-
And
having gone
they made secure
191563	the
tomb
having sealed
191567	the
stone
191570	with
191572	the
guard
191575	After
then
[the] Sabbaths
it
being dawn
191581	toward
191583	[the] first [day]
of [the] week
came
Mary
191588	-
Magdalene
and
191592	the
191594	other
Mary
to see
191598	the
tomb
And
behold
191603	an earthquake
there was
great
191607	an angel
for
of [the] Lord
having descended
191612	out of
heaven
and
having come
rolled away
191618	the
stone
and
was sitting
191623	upon
it
Was
now
191628	the
191630	appearance
of him
191633	like
lightning
and
191637	the
191639	clothing
of him
white
191643	as
snow
191646	From
now
191649	the
191651	fear
of him
trembled
those
keeping guard
and
became
191659	as
dead [men]
Answering
now
191664	the
angel
said
191668	to the
women
Not
fear
you
I know
for
that
Jesus
the [One]
having been crucified
you seek
Not
He is
here
He is risen
for
as
He said
Come
see
191690	the
place
where
He was lying
And
quickly
having gone
say
191699	to the
191701	disciples
of Him
that
He is risen
191706	from
191708	the
dead
and
behold
He goes before
you
191715	into
191717	-
Galilee
there
Him
you will see
Behold
I have told
you
And
having gone out
quickly
191729	from
191731	the
tomb
191734	with
fear
and
191738	joy
great
they ran
to tell
191743	the
191745	disciples
of Him
And
behold
Jesus
met
them
saying
Greetings
-
And
having come to [Him]
they took hold of
191759	His
191761	-
feet
and
worshiped
Him
Then
says
to them
191770	-
Jesus
Not
fear
Go
tell
191777	the
191779	brothers
of Me
so that
they should go
191784	into
191786	-
Galilee
and there
Me
will they see
[As] were going
now
they
behold
191796	some
191798	of the
guard
having gone
191802	into
191804	the
city
reported
191808	to the
chief priests
191811	all
the things
having been done
And
having been gathered together
191817	with
191819	the
elders
counsel
then
having taken
191825	silver pieces
many
they gave
191829	to the
soldiers
saying
Say
that
191835	the
191837	disciples
of Him
by night
having come
stole
Him
we
being asleep
And
if
is heard
this
191850	by
191852	the
governor
we
will persuade
and
you
out of trouble
will keep
-
And
having taken
money
they did
as
they were instructed
And
is spread abroad
191871	the
report
this
191875	among [the]
Jews
191878	until
191880	the
191882	present
day
191885	-
And
191888	the eleven
disciples
went
191892	into
191894	-
Galilee
191897	to
191899	the
mountain
where
assigned
them
191905	-
Jesus
And
having seen
Him
they worshiped
some
however
doubted
And
having come to [them]
191917	-
Jesus
spoke
to them
saying
Has been given
to Me
191925	all
191927	authority
191929	in
heaven
and
191933	on
191935	the

Having gone
therefore

191954	of the
Father
and

Son
and
191962	of the
191964	Holy
Spirit
teaching
them
to observe
all things
whatever
I commanded
you
And

I
191977	with
you
am

of God
As

192008	in
192010	-
Isaiah

prophet
Behold
I send
192018	the
192020	messenger
of Me
192023	before

of You
who
will prepare

192032	way
of You
192035	[The] voice
of one crying
192038	in
192040	the
wilderness
Prepare
192044	the
192046	way
of [the] Lord
straight

192051	the
192053	paths
of Him
Came
John
-
baptizing
192060	in
192062	the
wilderness
proclaiming
192066	[a] baptism
192068	of repentance
192070	for
192072	forgiveness
of sins
And
were going out
192077	to
him
192080	all
192082	the
192084	of Judea
region
and
192089	-
of Jerusalem
all
and
were being baptized
192095	by
him
192098	in
192100	the
Jordan
river
confessing
192105	the
192107	sins
of them
And
was
192112	-
John
clothed in
192116	hair
of a camel
and
192120	a belt
of leather
192123	around
192125	the
192127	waist
of him
and
he is eating
locusts
and
192134	honey
wild
And
he was preaching
saying
He comes
192141	who
192143	[is] mightier
than I
192146	after
me
of whom
not
I am
sufficient
having stooped down
to untie
192155	the
192157	strap
192159	of the
192161	sandals
of Him
I
baptized
you
with water
He
however
will baptize
you
192172	[the] Spirit
Holy
And
it came to pass
192177	in
192179	those
192181	-
days
[that] came
Jesus
192186	from
192188	Nazareth
192190	-
of Galilee
and
was baptized
192195	in
192197	the
Jordan
192200	by
John
And
immediately
going up
192206	from
192208	the
water
he saw
tearing open
192213	the
heavens
and
192217	the
Spirit
192220	as
a dove
descending
192224	upon
Him
And
a voice
came
192230	out of
192232	the
heavens
You
are
192237	the
192239	Son
of Me
192242	the
beloved
192245	in
You
I am well pleased
And
immediately
192251	the
Spirit
Him
drives out
192256	into
192258	the
wilderness
And
He was
192263	in
192265	the
wilderness
192268	forty
days
being tempted
192272	by
192274	-
Satan
And
He was
192279	with
192281	the
wild animals
and
192285	the
angels
were ministering
to Him
And
192291	after
the
delivering up
192295	-
of John
came
192299	-
Jesus
192302	into
192304	-
Galilee
proclaiming
192308	the
192310	gospel
192312	-
of God
and
saying
-
Has been fulfilled
192319	the
time
and
has drawn near
192324	the
192326	kingdom
192328	-
of God
repent
and
believe
192334	in
192336	the
gospel
And
passing
192341	by
192343	the
192345	Sea
192347	-
of Galilee
He saw
Simon
and
Andrew
192354	the
192356	brother
of Simon
casting a net
192360	into
192362	the
sea
they were
for
fishermen
And
said
to them
192371	-
Jesus
Come
192375	after
Me
and
I will make
you
to become
192382	fishers
of men
And
immediately
having left
192388	the
nets
they followed
Him
And
having gone on
a little
He saw
James
192398	the [son]
192400	-
of Zebedee
and
John
192405	the
192407	brother
of him
and
they
192412	[were] in
192414	the
boat
adjusting
192418	the
nets
And
immediately
He called
them
and
having left
192427	the
192429	father
of them
Zebedee
192433	in
192435	the
boat
192438	with
192440	the
hired servants
they went away
192444	after
Him
And
they go
192449	into
Capernaum
and
immediately
192454	on the
Sabbaths
having entered
192458	into
192460	the
synagogue
He was teaching
And
they were astonished
192466	at
192468	the
192470	teaching
of Him
192473	He was
for
teaching
them
as
authority
having
and
not
as
192484	the
scribes
And
immediately
there was
192490	in
192492	the
192494	synagogue
of them
192497	a man
192499	with
192501	a spirit
unclean
and
he cried out
saying
What
to us
and
to You
Jesus
of Nazareth
Did You come
to destroy
us
I know
You
who
are
192520	the
192522	Holy [One]
192524	-
of God
And
rebuked
him
192530	-
Jesus
Be silent
and
come forth
192536	out of
him
And
having thrown into convulsions
him
192542	the
192544	spirit
192546	-
unclean
and
having cried
192551	in a voice
loud
it came forth
192555	out of
him
And
were astonished
all
so as
to question
themselves
saying
What
is
this
192569	teaching
new
192572	With
authority
192575	even
192577	the
192579	spirits
192581	-
unclean
He commands
and
they obey
Him
And
went out
192590	the
192592	news
of Him
immediately
everywhere
192597	into
192599	all
192601	the
192603	surrounding region
192605	-
of Galilee
And
immediately
192610	out of
192612	the
synagogue
having gone forth
they came
192617	into
192619	the
192621	house
of Simon
and
Andrew
192626	with
James
and
John
192631	-
and
192634	the mother-in-law
of Simon
was laying sick
fevering
And
immediately
they speak
to Him
192643	about
her
And
having come to [her]
He raised up
her
having taken hold
192651	of the
hand
And
left
her
192657	the
fever
and
she began to minister
to them
Evening
now
having come
when
went down
192668	the
sun
they began bringing
192672	to
Him
192675	all
those
sick
being
and
those
being possessed by demons
And
192684	was
192686	all
192688	the
city
gathered together
192692	at
192694	the
door
And
He healed
192699	many
sick
being
192703	of various
diseases
and
192707	demons
many
He cast out
And
not
He would allow
to speak
192715	the
demons
because
they knew
Him
And
very early
192723	in night
still much
having risen up
He went out
and
departed
192730	into
192732	solitary
a place
and there
He was praying
And
went after
Him
Simon
and
192742	those
192744	with
him
and
having found
Him
also
they say
to Him
-
Everyone
seeks
You
And
He says
to them
Let us go
another way
192762	into
192764	the
192766	neighboring
towns
so that
192770	also
there
I might preach
192774	for
this
therefore
have I come forth
And
He was going
preaching
192782	in
192784	the
192786	synagogues
of them
192789	in
192791	all
192793	-
Galilee
and
192797	-
demons
casting out
And
comes
192803	to
Him
a leper
imploring
Him
and
kneeling down to Him
saying
to Him
-
If
You are willing
You are able
me
to cleanse
And
having been moved with compassion
having stretched out
192822	the
192824	hand
of Him
He touched him
and
says
to him
I am willing
be you cleansed
And
immediately
departed
192836	from
him
192839	the
leprosy
and
he was cleansed
And
having sternly warned
him
immediately
He sent away
him
And
He says
to him
See [that]
nothing
to none
you speak
But
go
yourself
show
192861	to the
priest
and
offer
192866	for
192868	the
192870	cleansing
of you
what
commanded
Moses
192876	for
192878	a testimony
to them
-
And
having gone out
he began
to proclaim
much
and
to spread abroad
192889	the
matter
so that
no longer
He
was able
openly
192897	into [the]
city
to enter
but
out
192903	in
192905	solitary
places
He was
and
they were coming
192911	to
Him
from every quarter
And
He having entered
again
192918	into
Capernaum
192921	after [some]
days
it was heard
that
192926	in
[the] house
He is
And
were gathered together
many
so that
no more
to have space
192936	not even
192938	-
192940	at
192942	the
door
and
He was speaking
to them
192948	the
word
And
they come
bringing
192954	to
Him
192957	a paralytic
being carried
192960	by
four
And
not
being able
to come near
to Him
192968	on account of
192970	the
crowd
they removed
192974	the
roof
where
He was
and
having broken up [it]
they let down
192982	the
pallet
on which
192986	the
paralytic
was lying
And
having seen
192992	-
Jesus
192995	the
192997	faith
of them
He says
193001	to the
paralytic
Son
are forgiven
193006	of you
193008	the
sins
Were
now
193013	some
193015	of the
scribes
there
sitting
and
reasoning
193022	in
193024	the
193026	hearts
of them
Why
this [man]
thus
does speak
He blasphemes
Who
is able
to forgive
sins
if
not
alone
193041	-
God
And
immediately
having known
193047	-
Jesus
193050	in the
193052	spirit
of Him
that
thus
they are reasoning
193058	within
themselves
He says
to them
Why
these things
reason you
193066	in
193068	the
193070	hearts
of you
Which
is
easier
to say
193077	to the
paralytic
Are forgiven
193081	of you
193083	the
sins
or
to say
Arise
and
take up
193091	the
193093	mat
of you
and
walk
That
however
you might know
that
authority
has
193104	the
193106	Son
193108	-
of Man
to forgive
sins
193113	on
193115	the
earth
He says
193119	to the
paralytic
To you
I say
arise
take up
193126	the
193128	mat
of you
and
go
193133	to
193135	the
193137	home
of you
And
he arose
and
immediately
having taken up
193145	the
mat
he went forth
193149	before
all
so as for
to be amazed
all
and
to glorify
193157	-
God
saying
-
Thus
never
did we see
And
He went forth
again
193168	beside
193170	the
sea
and
193174	all
193176	the
crowd
was coming
193180	to
Him
and
He taught
them
And
passing on
He saw
Levi
193190	the [son]
193192	-
of Alphaeus
sitting
193196	at
193198	the
tax booth
and
He says
to him
Follow
Me
And
having arisen
he followed
Him
And
it came to pass
reclining
of Him
193214	in
193216	the
193218	house
of him
that
193222	many
tax collectors
and
sinners
were reclining with
193228	-
Jesus
and
193232	the
193234	disciples
of Him
there were
for
many
and
they were following
Him
And
193244	the
193246	scribes
193248	of the
Pharisees
having seen
Him
eating
193254	with
193256	the
sinners
and
tax collectors
were saying
193262	to the
193264	disciples
of Him
Why
193268	with
193270	the
tax collectors
and
sinners
does He eat
And
having heard
193278	-
Jesus
says
to them
No
193284	need
have
those
being strong
of a physician
but
those
sick
being
Not
I came
to call
[the] righteous
but
sinners
And
193301	were
193303	the
193305	disciples
of John
and
193309	the
Pharisees
fasting
And
they come
and
say
to Him
193318	Because of
why
193321	the
193323	disciples
of John
and
193327	the
193329	disciples
193331	of the
Pharisees
fast
193335	-
but
193338	Your
disciples
not
fast
And
said
to them
193346	-
Jesus
Not
are able
193351	the
193353	sons
193355	of the
bridechamber
193358	in
which
193361	the
bridegroom
193364	with
them
is
to fast
193369	As long as
time
they have
193373	the
bridegroom
193376	with
them
not
they are able
to fast
Will come
however
[the] days
when
will have been taken away
193387	from
them
193390	the
bridegroom
and
then
they will fast
193396	in
193398	those
193400	the
days
No one
193404	a patch
193406	of cloth
unshrunk
sews
193410	on
193412	clothing
old
if
now
not
tears away
193419	the
193421	patch
193423	from
it
193426	-
new
193429	from the
old
And
193433	worse
a tear
takes place
And
no one
puts
193440	wine
new
193443	into
193445	wineskins
old
if
now
not
will burst
193452	the
wine
193455	the
wineskins
and
193459	the
wine
will be destroyed
and
193464	the
wineskins
Instead
193468	wine
new
193471	into
193473	wineskins
new
And
it came to pass
He
193479	on
193481	the
Sabbaths
is passing
193485	through
193487	the
grainfields
and
193491	the
193493	disciples
of Him
began
[their] way
to make
plucking
193500	the
heads of grain
And
193504	the
Pharisees
were saying
to Him
Behold
why
do they
193512	on the
Sabbaths
that which
not
is lawful
And
He said
to them
Never
did you read
what
did
David
when
need
he had
and
hungered
he
and
193533	those
193535	with
him
How
he entered
193540	into
193542	the
193544	house
193546	-
of God
193549	in [the days of]
Abiathar
the high priest
and
193554	the
193556	loaves
193558	of the
presentation
ate
which
not
it is lawful
to eat
if
not
193568	for the
priests
And
he gave
193573	even
to those
193576	with
him
being
And
He said
to them
193583	The
Sabbath
193586	on account of
193588	the
man
was made
and
not
193594	the
man
193597	on account of
193599	the
Sabbath
So then
193603	Lord
is
193606	the
193608	Son
193610	-
of Man
193613	also even
193615	of the
Sabbath
And
He entered
again
193621	into
synagogue
and
there was
there
193627	a man
withered
having
193631	the
hand
and
they were watching
Him
whether
193638	on the
Sabbaths
He will heal
him
in order that
they might accuse
Him
And
He says
193648	to the
man
-
193652	the
193654	hand
having
withered
Arise
193659	into
193661	the
midst
And
He says
to them
Is it lawful
193668	on the
Sabbaths
to do good

or
to do evil
Life
to save
or
to kill
-
But
they were silent
And
having looked around on
them
193685	with
anger
being grieved
193689	at
193691	the
193693	hardness
193695	of the
193697	heart
of them
He says
193701	to the
man
Stretch out
193705	the
hand
And
he stretched [it] out
and
was restored
193712	the
193714	hand
of him
And
having gone out
193719	the
Pharisees
immediately
193723	with
193725	the
Herodians
counsel
began to take
193730	against
Him
how
Him
they might destroy
And
193737	-
Jesus
193740	with
193742	the
193744	disciples
of Him
withdrew
193748	to
193750	the
sea
and
193755	great
a multitude
193758	from
193760	-
Galilee
followed
and
193765	from
193767	-
Judea
and
193771	from
Jerusalem
and
193775	from
193777	-
Idumea
and
193781	beyond
193783	the
Jordan
and
193787	around
Tyre
and
Sidon
193792	A multitude
great
having heard
how much
He was doing
came
193799	to
Him
And
He spoke
193804	to the
193806	disciples
of Him
that
a boat
might wait upon
Him
193813	on account of
193815	the
crowd
that
not
they might press upon
Him
Many
for
He healed
so as for
to press upon
Him
that
Him
they might touch
as many as
had
diseases
And
193835	the
193837	spirits
193839	-
unclean
whenever
Him
they beheld
were falling down before
Him
and
crying out
saying
-
You
are
193853	the
193855	Son
193857	-
of God
And
much
He would rebuke
them
so that
not
Him
known
they should make
And
He goes up
193871	on
193873	the
mountain
and
calls near
those whom
he wanted
Himself
and
they went
193883	to
Him
And
He appointed
twelve
that
they might be
193891	with
Him
and
that
He might send
them
to preach
and
to have
authority
to cast out
193903	-
demons
And
He appointed
193908	the
Twelve
And
He added
[the] name
193914	to
Simon
Peter
and
James
193920	the [son]
193922	of
Zebedee
and
John
193927	the
193929	brother
193931	-
of James
and
He added
to them [the]
name
Boanerges
which
is
193941	Sons
of thunder
and
Andrew
and
Philip
and
Bartholomew
and
Matthew
and
Thomas
and
James
193956	the [son]
193958	-
of Alphaeus
and
Thaddaeus
and
Simon
193965	the
Zealot
and
Judas
Iscariot
who
also
betrayed
Him
And
He comes
193977	to
a house
and
comes together
again
193983	a
crowd
so that
not
are they able
them
even
bread
to eat
And
having heard [of it]
193995	those
193997	belonging to
Him
went out
to seize
Him
they were saying
for
-
He is out of His mind
And
194008	the
scribes
those
194012	from
Jerusalem
having come down
were saying
-
Beelzebul
He has
and
-
194022	By
194024	the
194026	prince
194028	of the
demons
He casts out
194032	the
demons
And
having called to [Him]
them
194038	in
parables
He began speaking
to them
How
is able
Satan
Satan
to cast out
And
if
a kingdom
194051	against
itself
is divided
not
is able
to stand
194059	the
kingdom
that
And
if
a house
194066	against
itself
is divided
not
will be able
194073	the
house
that
to stand
And
if
194080	-
Satan
has risen up
194084	against
himself
and
has been divided
not
he is able
to stand
but
an end
is coming to
But
not
is able
no one
194099	into
194101	the
194103	house
194105	of the
strong man
having entered
194109	the
194111	goods
of him
to plunder
if
not
first
194118	the
strong man
he binds
And
then
194124	the
194126	house
of him
he will plunder
Truly
I say
to you
that
194134	all
will be forgiven
194137	the
194139	sons
194141	the
of men
194144	the
sins
and
194148	the
blasphemies
as many as
if
they shall have blasphemed
Whoever
however
-
shall blaspheme
194158	against
194160	the
194162	Spirit
194164	-
Holy
not
has
forgiveness
194170	to
194172	the
age
but
guilty
is
194178	[of] eternal
sin
For
they were saying
194183	A spirit
unclean
he has
And
arrive
194189	the
194191	mother
of Him
and
194195	the
194197	brothers
of Him
and
outside
standing
sent
194204	to
Him
calling
Him
And
was sitting
194211	around
Him
a crowd
And
they said
to Him
Behold
194219	the
194221	mother
of You
and
194225	the
194227	brothers
of You
and
194231	the
194233	sister
of you
outside
are seeking
You
And
He answering
them
says
Who
are
194245	the
194247	mother
of Me
and
194251	the
brothers
And
having looked around on
those who
194257	around
Him
in a circle
were sitting
He says
Behold
194264	the
194266	mother
of Me
and
194270	the
194272	brothers
of Me
Whoever
-
shall do
194278	the
194280	will
194282	-
of God
he
194286	brother
of Me
and
sister
and
mother
is
And
again
He began
to teach
194298	beside
194300	the
sea
And
was gathered together
194305	to
Him
194308	a crowd
great
so that
He
194313	into
a boat
having entered
sat
194318	in
194320	the
sea
and
194324	all
194326	the
crowd
194329	close to
194331	the
sea
194334	on
194336	the
land
was
And
He began teaching
them
194343	in
parables
many things
and
He was saying
to them
194350	in
194352	the
194354	teaching
of Him
Listen
Behold
went out
the [one]
sowing
to sow
And
it came to pass
194365	as
-
he sowed
some
-
fell
194372	along
194374	the
road
and
came
194379	the
birds
and
devoured
it
And
other
fell
194388	upon
194390	the
rocky place
where
not
it had
194396	soil
much
and
immediately
it sprang up
194402	because of
the
not
having
194407	depth
of soil
And
after
rose
194413	the
sun
it was scorched
and
194418	because of
-
not
having
root
it withered away
And
other
fell
194428	among
194430	the
thorns
and
grew up
194435	the
thorns
and
choked
it
and
fruit
no
it yielded
And
other
fell
194448	into
194450	the
194452	soil
194454	-
good
and
began yielding
fruit
growing up
and
increasing
and
bearing
194465	one
thirtyfold
and
194469	one
sixty
and
194473	one
a hundred
And
He was saying
He who
has
ears
to hear
let him hear
And
when
He was
194486	with
alone
began asking
Him
194491	those
194493	around
Him
194496	with
194498	the
Twelve
194501	about the
parable
And
He was saying
to them
To you
194508	the
194510	mystery
has been given
194513	of the
194515	kingdom
194517	-
of God
194520	To those
however
194523	who are
outside
194526	in
parables
194529	-
everything
is done
so that
Seeing
they might see
and
not
perceive
and
hearing
they might hear
and
not
understand
lest
ever
they should turn
and
should be forgiven
them
And
He says
to them
Not
understand you
194557	the
parable
this
And
how
194563	all
194565	the
parables
will you understand
The [one]
sowing
194571	the
word
sows
These
now
are
194578	they
194580	along
194582	the
road
where
is sown
194587	the
word
and
when
they hear
immediately
comes
194595	-
Satan
and
takes away
194600	the
word
-
having been sown
194605	in
them
And
these
are
likewise
those
194613	upon
194615	the
rocky places
sown
who
when
they hear
194622	the
word
immediately
194626	with
joy
receive
it
and
not
they have
root
194635	in
themselves
but
temporary
are
then
having arisen
tribulation
or
persecution
194646	on account of
194648	the
word
immediately
they fall away
And
these
are
those
194657	among
194659	the
thorns
sown
These
are
those
194666	the
word
having heard
and
194671	the
194673	cares
194675	-
of this age
and
194679	the
194681	deceit
194683	of the
riches
and
194687	-
194690	of
194692	the
other things
desires
entering in
choke
194698	the
word
and
unfruitful
it becomes
And
these
are
those
194708	upon
194710	the
194712	soil
194714	-
good
having been sown
such as
hear
194720	the
word
and
receive [it]
and
bring forth fruit
194727	one
thirtyfold
and
194731	one
sixty
and
194735	one
a hundred
And
He was saying
to them
-
Not
is brought in
194744	the
lamp
so that
194748	under
194750	the
basket
it might be put
or
194755	under
194757	the
bed
[Is it] not
that
194762	upon
194764	the
lampstand
it might be put
Nothing
for
there is
194771	which [is]
hidden
if
not
that
it should be made manifest
nor
has taken place
a secret thing
but
that
it should come
194784	to
light
If
anyone
has
ears
to hear
let him hear
And
He was saying
to them
Take heed
what
you hear
194799	With
194801	what
measure
you measure
it will be measured
to you
and
more will be added
to you
Whoever
for
may have
it will be given
to him
and
he who
not
has
194819	even
that which
he has
will be taken away
194824	from
him
And
He was saying
Thus
is
194831	the
194833	kingdom
194835	-
of God
as
a man
should cast
194841	the
seed
194844	upon
194846	the
earth
and
should sleep
and
rise
night
and
day
and
194857	the
seed
should sprout
and
grow
how
not
knows
he
Of itself
194868	the
earth
brings forth fruit
first
a plant
then
an ear
then
full
grain
194879	in
194881	the
ear
When
then
offers itself
194887	the
fruit
immediately
he sends
194892	the
sickle
for
has come
194897	the
harvest
And
He was saying
To what
shall we liken
194904	the
194906	kingdom
194908	-
of God
Or
194912	in
194914	what
it
parable
shall we present
194919	As
194921	to a grain
of mustard
which
when
it has been sown
194927	upon
194929	the
earth
smallest
is
194934	of all
194936	the
seeds
194939	which [are]
194941	upon
194943	the
earth
and
when
it has been sown
it grows up
and
becomes
greater
194953	than all
194955	the
garden plants
and
it produces
194960	branches
great
so that
are able
194965	under
194967	the
194969	shadow
of it
194972	the
194974	birds
194976	of the
air
to perch
And
194982	with such
parables
many
He kept speaking
to them
194988	the
word
as
they were able
to hear
194994	Without
then
parables
not
would He speak
to them
195001	in
private
however
195005	to His
195007	own
disciples
He would explain
all things
And
He says
to them
195015	on
195017	that
195019	-
day
evening
having come
Let us pass over
195025	to
195027	the
other side
And
having dismissed
195032	the
crowd
they take with [them]
Him
since
He was
195039	in
195041	the
boat
also
195045	other
boats
were
195049	with
Him
And
comes
195055	a storm
violent
of wind
And
195060	the
waves
were breaking
195064	over
195066	the
boat
so that
already
is being filled up
195072	the
boat
And
He
was
195078	in
195080	the
stern
195083	on
195085	the
cushion
sleeping
And
they awaken
Him
and
say
to Him
Teacher
not
is it concern
to You
that
we perish
And
having been awoken
He rebuked
195104	the
wind
and
said
195109	to the
sea
Silence
be still
And
abated
195116	the
wind
and
there was
195121	a calm
great
And
He said
to them
Why
fearful
are you
Still not


have you
faith
And
they feared
195137	[with] fear
great
and
were saying
195142	to
each other
Who
then
this
is
that
even
195151	the
wind
and
195155	the
sea
obey
Him
And
they came
195162	to
195164	the
195166	other side
195168	of the
sea
195171	to
195173	the
195175	region
195177	of the
Gerasenes
And
having gone forth
of Him
195183	out of
195185	the
boat
immediately
met
Him
195191	out of
195193	the
tombs
195196	a man
195198	with
195200	a spirit
unclean
who
195204	the
dwelling
had
195208	in
195210	the
tombs
And
195214	not even
with chains
no longer
anyone
was able
him
to bind
195222	because
that
he
often
with shackles
and
chains
had been bound
and
had been torn in two
195233	by
him
195236	the
chains
and
195240	the
shackles
had been shattered
and
no one
was able
him
to subdue
And
195250	constantly
all
night
and
day
195256	in
195258	the
tombs
and
195262	in
195264	the
mountains
195267	he was
crying out
and
cutting
himself
with stones
And
having seen
195276	-
Jesus
195279	from
afar
he ran
and
fell on his knees
before Him
And
having cried
195288	in a voice
loud
he said
What
to me
and
to You
Jesus
195297	Son
195299	-
of God
195302	the
Most High
I adjure
You
195307	-
by God
not
me
torment
He was saying
for
to him
You come forth
195317	the
195319	spirit
195321	-
unclean
195324	out of
195326	the
man
And
He was asking
him
What [is]
195333	[the] name
of you
And
saying
he answered
Legion
195340	[is] name
to Me
because
many
we are
And
he begged
Him
numerous times
that
not
them
He would send
195354	out of
195356	the
country
There was
now
there
195362	near
195364	the
mountain
195369	a herd
of pigs
great
feeding
And
they begged
Him
saying
Send
us
195380	into
195382	the
pigs
so that
195386	into
them
we may enter
And
He allowed
them
And
having gone out
195395	the
195397	spirits
195399	-
unclean
entered
195403	into
195405	the
pigs
and
rushed
195410	the
herd
195413	down
195415	the
steep bank
195418	into
195420	the
sea
195423	about
two thousand
and
they were drowned
195428	in
195430	the
sea
And
those
feeding
them
fled
and
proclaimed [it]
195440	to
195442	the
city
and
195446	to
195448	the
country
And
they went out
to see
what
it is
that
has been done
And
they come
195460	to
195462	-
Jesus
and
see
the [man]
possessed by demons
sitting
clothed
and
sound minded
the [one]
having had
195475	the
legion
and
they were afraid
And
related
to them
those
having seen [it]
how
it happened
to the [one]
being possessed by demons
and
195490	concerning
195492	the
pigs
And
they began
to implore
Him
to depart
195500	from
195502	the
195504	region
of them
And
having entered
He
195510	into
195512	the
boat
was begging
Him
the [one]
having been possessed by demons
that
195520	with
Him
he might be
And
not
He did permit
him
but
He says
to him
Go
195532	to
195534	the
195536	home
of you
195539	to
195541	-
your own
and
report
to them
how much
195548	the
Lord
for you
did
and
had mercy on
you
And
he departed
and
began
to proclaim
195561	in
195563	the
Decapolis
how much
had done
for him
195569	-
Jesus
and
all
were marveling
And
having passed over
195577	-
Jesus
195580	in
195582	the
boat
again
195586	to
195588	the
other side
was gathered
195592	a crowd
great
195595	to
Him
and
He was
195600	beside
195602	the
sea
And
comes
195608	one
195610	of the
synagogue rulers
named
Jairus
and
having seen
Him
falls
195619	at
195621	the
195623	feet
of Him
and
he begs
Him
much
saying
-
195632	The
195634	little daughter
of me
at the end
is holding
that
having come
You would lay
195642	the
hands
on her
so that
she might be cured
and
she shall live
And
He departed
195652	with
him
And
was following
Him
195658	a crowd
great
and
pressing in on
Him
And
195665	a woman
being
195668	with
195670	a flux
of blood
195673	twelve
years
and
much
having suffered
195679	under
195681	many
physicians
and
having spent
195686	the
195689	of
her
all
and
in no way
having benefited
but
rather
195698	to
195700	the
worse
having come
having heard
195705	-
195707	concerning
195709	-
Jesus
having come up
195713	in
195715	the
crowd
behind
she touched
195720	the
195722	clothing
of Him
She was saying
for
-
If
I shall touch
195730	even
195732	the
195734	garments
of Him
I will be healed
And
immediately
was dried up
195741	the
195743	flow
195745	of the
195747	blood
of her
and
she knew
195752	in the
body
that
she was healed
195757	from
195759	the
affliction
And
immediately
195764	-
Jesus
having known
195768	in
Himself
195771	the
195774	out of
Him

and
fell down before

and
told
Him
195836	all
195838	the
truth
-
And
He said
to her
Daughter

195848	faith
of you
has healed

195854	in
peace
and
be

195860	from
195862	the
195864	affliction
of you
[While] yet
He
is speaking
they come
195871	from
195873	the
ruler of synagogueâs [house]
saying
-
195878	The
195880	daughter
of You

why
still

195887	the
Teacher
195890	-
And
Jesus
having heard
195895	the
word
spoken
says
195900	to the
ruler of the synagogue
Not

195935	house
195937	of the
ruler of the synagogue
and
He beholds
a commotion
and
weeping
and
wailing
much
And
having entered
He says
to them
Why
make you commotion
and
weep
195956	The
child
not
is dead
but
sleeps
And
they were laughing at
Him
He
then
having put out
all
takes with [Him]
195971	the
195973	father
195975	of the
child

196001	of the
child
He says
to her
Talitha

Which
196009	is
translated
196012	-
Little girl

And
immediately
arose
196021	the
girl
and
began walking
she was
for
196028	of years
twelve
And
they were overcome
immediately
196034	with amazement
great
And
He instructed
them
strictly
that
no one
should know
this
and
He commanded
to be given
to her
to eat
And
He went out
from there
and
came

196057	the
196059	hometown
of Him
and

He began
to teach
196075	in
196077	the
synagogue
and
196081	-
many
hearing
were astonished
saying
From where
to this [man]
these things
and
what [is]
196092	the
wisdom
-
having been given
to Him
even
196100	the
miracles
such
196104	by
196106	the
196108	hands
of Him
are done
Not

196122	-
of Mary
and

and
Simon
And
not
are
196138	the
196140	sisters
of Him
here
196144	with
us
And
they took offense
196149	at
Him
And
said
to them
196155	-
Jesus
-
Not
is
a prophet
without honor
if
not
196165	in

of him
and
196173	among

196177	relatives
of him
and
196181	in
196183	the
196185	household
of him
And
not
He was able
there
to do
196193	not any
work of power
if
not
196198	on a few
sick
having laid
196202	the
hands
He healed
And
He was amazed
196208	because of
196210	the
196212	unbelief
of them
And
He was going
196217	the
villages
around
teaching
And
He calls near
196224	the
Twelve
and
He began
them
to send forth
two
[by] two
and
He gave
to them
196236	authority
196238	over the
196240	spirits
196242	-
unclean
And
He instructed
them
that
nothing
they should take
196251	for [the]
journey
if
not
a staff
only
no
bread
nor
bag
nor

196265	the
belt
money
but
wearing
sandals
and
not
put on
196275	two
tunics
And
He would say
to them
Wherever
if
you enter
196284	into
a house
there
remain
until
-
you go out
from there
And
196294	whatever

place

will receive
you
nor

from there
shake off
196307	the
dust
196310	which [is]
196312	under
196314	the
196316	feet
of you
196319	for
196321	a testimony
against them
And
having gone out
they preached
that
they should repent
And
196330	demons
many
they were casting out
and
were anointing
with oil

And

they were saying
-
John

is risen
196363	out from
[the] dead
and
196367	because of
this
operate
196371	the
miraculous powers
196374	in
him
Others
however
were saying
-
Elijah
He is
Others
now
were saying
-
A prophet
like
196389	one
196391	of the
prophets
Having heard
now
196396	-
Herod
was saying
Whom

196428	wife
of Philip

Had been saying

196454	wife
196456	of the
196458	brother
of you
196461	-
And
Herodias
held it
against him
and
wished
him
to kill
and
not
was able
196474	-
for
Herod
was afraid of

John
knowing
him
196484	[to be] a man
righteous
and
holy
and
he kept safe

And

him
greatly
he was perplexed
and
gladly

heard
And

opportune
when

196510	birthday
of him

reclining with [him]
196552	-
And
the king
said
196557	to the
girl
Ask
me
whatever
if
you wish
and
I will give
to you
And
he swore
to her
that
if
me
you might ask
I will give
you
196577	up to
196579	half
196581	of the
196583	kingdom
of me
And
having gone out
she said
196589	to the
196591	mother
of her
What
shall I ask
-
And
she said
196599	The
196601	head
of John
the [one]
baptizing
And
having entered
immediately
196609	with
haste
196612	to
196614	the
king
she asked
saying
I desire
that
at once
you give
to me
196624	upon
a platter
196627	the
196629	head
of John
196632	the
Baptist
And
encompassingly sorrowful
having been made
196638	the
king
196641	on account of
196643	the
oaths
and
those
reclining with [him]
not
was he willing
to refuse
her
And
immediately
having sent
196656	the
king
an executioner
he commanded
to be brought
196662	the
196664	head
of him
And
having gone
he beheaded
him
196671	in
196673	the

and
brought
196678	the
196680	head
of him
196683	upon
a platter
and
gave
it
196689	to the
girl
and
196693	the
girl
gave
it
196698	to the
196700	mother
of her
And
having heard [it]
196705	the
196707	disciples
of him
came
and
took up
196713	the
196715	body
of him
and
laid
it
196721	in
[a] tomb
And
are gathered together
196726	the
apostles
196729	to
196731	-
Jesus
and
they related
to him
196737	all things
what
they had done
and
what
they had taught
And
He said
to them
Come
196748	you
yourselves
196751	apart
own
196754	to
196756	[a] solitary
place
and
rest
a little
Were
for
those
coming
and
those
going
many
and
not even
to eat
had they opportunity
And
they went away
196776	by
196778	the
boat
196781	into
196783	[a] solitary
place
196786	by
themselves
And
they saw
them
going
and
recognized
many
and
on foot
196798	from
196800	all
196802	the
cities
ran together
there
and
went before
them
And
having gone out
He saw
196813	a great
crowd
and
was moved with compassion
196818	toward
them
because
they were
196823	like
196825	sheep
not
having
a shepherd
And
He began
to teach
them
many things
And
already
the hour
late
being
having come
to Him
196842	the
196844	disciples
of Him
were saying
-
Desolate
is
196851	the
place
and
already [it is]
an hour
late
Dismiss
them
that
having gone
196862	to
196864	the
196866	surrounding
region
and
villages
they might buy
for themselves
something
to eat
-
But
answering
He said
to them
Give
to them
you
[something] to eat
And
they say
to Him
Having gone
shall we buy
196890	denarii
two hundred
of bread
and
give
them
to eat
-
And
He says
to them
196902	How many
have you
loaves
Go
see
And
having known
they say
Five
and
196913	two
fish
And
He commanded
them
to make recline
all
groups
[by] groups
196923	on
196925	the
196927	green
grass
And
they sat down
groups
[by] groups
196934	by
hundreds
and
196938	by
fifties
And
having taken
196943	the
196945	five
loaves
and
196949	the
196951	two
fish
having looked up
196955	to
196957	the
heaven
He blessed
and
broke
196963	the
loaves
and
He kept giving [them]
196968	to the
disciples
that
they might set before
them
And
196975	the
196977	two
fish
He divided
among all
And
ate
all
and
were satisfied
And
they took up
of fragments
196991	twelve
hand-baskets
full
and
196996	of
196998	the
fish
And
were
those
having eaten of
197005	the
loaves
197008	five thousand
men
And
immediately
He compelled
197014	the
197016	disciples
of Him
to enter
197020	into
197022	the
boat
and
to go before
197027	to
197029	the
other side
197032	to
Bethsaida
until
He
should dismiss
197038	the
crowd
And
having taken leave of
them
He departed
197045	into
197047	the
mountain
to pray
And
evening
having come
was
197055	the
boat
197058	in
197060	the midst
197062	of the
sea
and
He
alone
197068	upon
197070	the
land
And
He having seen
them
straining
197077	in
the
rowing
was
for
197083	the
wind
contrary
to them
197088	About
197090	[the] fourth
197092	watch
197094	of the
night
He comes
197098	to
them
walking
197102	on
197104	the
sea
and
He was wishing
to pass by
them
-
And
having seen
Him
197115	on
197117	the
sea
walking
they thought
that
a ghost
[it] is
and
cried out
All
for
Him
saw
and
were troubled
-
And
immediately
He spoke
197137	with
them
and
says
to them
Take courage
I
am [He]
not
fear
And
He went up
197150	to
them
197153	into
197155	the
boat
and
ceased
197160	the
wind
And
exceedingly
197165	in
abundance
197168	in
themselves
they were amazed
not
for
they understood
197175	by
197177	the
loaves
but
197181	had been
197183	of them
197185	the
heart
hardened
And
having passed over
197191	to
197193	the
land
they came
197197	to
Gennesaret
and
drew to shore
And
on having come
of them
197205	out of
197207	the
boat
immediately
having recognized
Him
they ran around
197215	all
197217	the
country
that
and
they began
197223	on
197225	the
mats
those
sick
being
to carry about
to wherever
they were hearing
that
He is
And
wherever
-
He entered
197240	into
villages
or
197244	into
cities
or
197248	into
fields
197251	in
197253	the
marketplaces
they were laying
the
ailing
and
were begging
Him
that

197266	fringe

197270	clothing
of Him
they might touch
and
as many as

touched
Him
were being healed
And
are gathered together
197282	to
Him
197285	the
Pharisees
and
197289	some
197291	of the
scribes
having come
197295	from
Jerusalem
And
they had seen
197300	some
197302	of the
197304	disciples
of Him
that
197308	with defiled
hands
that
is
unwashed
are eating
197315	the
bread
197318	-
For
the Pharisees
and
197323	all
197325	the
Jews

hands

holding
197338	the
197340	tradition
197342	of the
elders
and

the market
if

and
other things
many
there are
which
they received
[for them] to hold to
197361	washings
of cups
and
vessels
and
utensils
And
questioned
Him
197371	the
Pharisees
and
197375	the
scribes
197378	Because of
why
not
walk
197383	the
197385	disciples
of You
197388	according to
197390	the
197392	tradition
197394	of the
elders
but
197398	with unwashed
hands
eat
197402	the
bread
-
And
He said
to them
Rightly
prophesied
Isaiah
197412	concerning
you
197415	-
hypocrites
as
it has been written
-
197421	This
197423	-
people
197426	with the
lips
Me
honors
197431	-
but
197434	the heart
of them
far away
is kept
197439	from
Me
In vain
now
they worship
Me
teaching
[as] doctrines
197448	[the] precepts
of men
Having neglected
197452	the
197454	commandment
197456	-
of God
you hold
197460	to the
197462	tradition
197464	-
of men
And
He was saying
to them
Neatly
do you set aside
197472	the
197474	commandment
197476	-
of God
that
197480	the
197482	tradition
of you
you might keep
Moses
for
said
Honor
197490	the
197492	Father
of you
and
197496	the
197498	mother
of you
and
The [one]
speaking evil of
father
or
mother
in death
must end
You
however
say [that]
if
says
a man
197515	to the
father
or
197519	the
mother
[It is] Corban
that
is
a gift
whatever
if
197528	from
me
you might be profited
no longer
do you allow
him
anything
to do
197537	for the
father
or
197541	the
mother
making void
197545	the
197547	word
197549	-
of God
197552	for the
197554	tradition
of you
which
you have handed down
And
197561	like [things]
such
many
you do
And
having called to [Him]
again
197569	the
crowd
He was saying
to them
Listen to
Me
all
and
understand
Nothing
there is
197582	from outside
197584	the
man
entering
197588	into
him
which
is able
to defile
him
but
the things
197597	out of
197599	the
man
proceeding
are
the things
defiling
197606	the
man
And
when
He went
197612	into
[the] house
197615	from
197617	the
crowd
were asking
Him
197622	the
197624	disciples
of Him
197627	the
parable
And
He says
to them
Thus
197634	also
you
without understanding
are
Not
understand you
that
197642	everything
-
from outside
entering
197647	into
197649	the
man
not
is able
him
to defile
because
not
it enters
197660	of him
into
197663	the
heart
but
197667	into
197669	the
belly
and
197673	into
197675	the
sewer
goes out
purifying
197680	all
197682	the
food
He was saying
now
-
That
197689	out of
197691	the
man
going forth
that
defiles
197697	the
man
197700	Within
for
197703	from
197705	the
197707	heart
197709	-
of men
197712	-
197714	thoughts
197716	-
evil
go forth
sexual immorality
thefts
murders
adulteries
covetous desires
wickednesses
deceit
sensuality
197728	an eye
evil
slander
pride
foolishness
197734	All
197736	these
197738	-
evils
from within
go forth
and
they defile
197745	the
man
From there
also
having risen up
He went away
197752	into
197754	the
197756	region
of Tyre
And
having entered
197761	into
a house
no one
He was wishing
to know [it]
and
not
He was able
to be hidden
But
immediately
having heard
a woman
197775	about
Him
197778	of whom
had
197781	the
197783	little daughter
of her
197786	spirit
unclean
having come
fell
197791	at
197793	the
197795	feet
of Him
197798	-
Now
the woman
was
Gentile
Syrophoenician
197805	by
race
and
kept asking
Him
that
197812	the
demon
He should cast forth
197816	out of
197818	the
197820	daughter
of her
And
He was saying
to her
Permit
first
to be satisfied
197829	the
children
not
for
it is
good
to take
197837	the
197839	bread
197841	of the
children
and
197845	to the
dogs
to cast [it]
-
But
she answered
and
says
to Him
Yes
Lord
197857	even
197859	the
dogs
197862	under
197864	the
table
eat
197868	of
197870	the
197872	crumbs
197874	of the
children
And
He said
to her
197880	Because of
197882	this
197884	-
word
go
has gone forth
197889	out of
197891	the
197893	daughter
of you
197896	the
demon
And
having gone away
197901	to
197903	the
197905	home
of her
she found
197909	the
child
lying
197913	on
197915	the
bed
and
197919	the
demon
having gone out
And
again
having departed
197926	from
197928	the
197930	region
of Tyre
He came
197934	through
Sidon
197937	to
197939	the
197941	Sea
197943	-
of Galilee
197946	through
197948	[the] midst
197950	of the
197952	region
of [the] Decapolis
And
they bring
to Him
a deaf man
and
who spoke with difficulty
and
they implore
Him
that
He might lay
on him
197967	the
hand
And
having taken away
him
197973	from
197975	the
crowd
197978	aside
privately
He put
197982	the
197984	fingers
of Him
197987	to
197989	the
197991	ears
of him
and
having spit
He touched
197997	the
197999	tongue
of him
and
having looked up
198004	to
198006	-
heaven
He sighed deeply
and
He says
to him
Ephphatha
that
is
Be opened
And
were opened
198019	his
198021	-
ears
and
immediately
was loosed
198027	the
198029	band
198031	of the
198033	tongue
of him
and
he began speaking
plainly
And
He instructed
them
that
no one
they should tell
As much as
however
He
kept instructing
them
198050	more
abundantly
they were proclaiming [it]
And
above measure
they were astonished
saying
Well
all things
He has done
both
198062	the
deaf
He makes
to hear
and
mute
to speak
198070	In
198072	those
198074	-
days
again
198078	great
[the] crowd
being
and
not
having
what
they might eat
having called to [Him]
198088	the
disciples
He says
to them
I am moved with compassion
198094	upon
198096	the
crowd
because
already
198101	days
three
they continue
with Me
and
nothing
have
that
they might eat
And
if
I shall send away
198114	them
hungry
198117	to
198119	[the] homes
of them
they will faint
198123	on
198125	the
way
For
198129	some
of them
198132	from
afar
are come
And
answered
Him
198139	the
198141	disciples
of Him
-
From where
these
will be able
anyone
here
to satisfy
with bread
198152	in
this desolate place
And
He was asking
them
198158	How many
have you
loaves
-
And
they said
Seven
And
He directs
198168	the
crowd
to recline
198172	on
198174	the
ground
And
having taken
198179	the
198181	seven
loaves
having given thanks
He broke [them]
and
kept giving [them]
198188	to
198190	disciples
of Him
that
they might set before [them]
And
they set [it] before
198197	the
crowd
And
they had
198202	small fish
a few
And
having blessed
them
He ordered
198209	also
these
to be set before [them]
And
they ate
and
were satisfied
And
they took up
198219	over and above
of fragments
198222	seven
baskets
There were
now
198227	about
four thousand
And
He sent away
them
And
immediately
having entered
198236	into
198238	the
boat
198241	with
198243	the
198245	disciples
of Him
He came
198249	into
198251	the
198253	district
of Dalmanutha
And
went out
198258	the
Pharisees
and
began
to dispute with
Him
seeking
198266	from
Him
a sign
198270	from
198272	-
heaven
testing
Him
And
having sighed deeply
198279	in the
198281	spirit
of Him
He says
Why
198287	the
generation
this
seeks
a sign
Truly
I say
to you
if
there will be given
198299	to the
generation
this
a sign
And
having left
them
again
having embarked
He went away
198310	to
198312	the
other side
And
they forgot
to take
loaves
and
if
not
198322	one
loaf
not
they had
198327	with
them
198330	in
198332	the
boat
And
He was instructing
them
saying
Watch out
take heed
198341	of
198343	the
198345	leaven
198347	of the
Pharisees
and
198351	of the
198353	leaven
of Herod
And
they were reasoning
198358	with
one another
because
loaves
not
they have
And
having known [it]
He says
to them
Why
reason you
because
loaves
not
you have
Not yet
do you perceive
nor
understand
Hardened
do you have
198381	the
198383	heart
of you
Eyes
having
not
do you see
And
ears
having
not
do you hear
And
not
do you remember
When
198399	the
198401	five
loaves
I broke
198405	for
198407	the
five thousand
198410	how many
198413	hand-baskets
of fragments
full
took you up
They say
to Him
Twelve
When
198422	the
seven
198425	to
198427	the
four thousand
198432	of how many
baskets
[the] fillings
of fragments
took you up
And
said
Seven
And
He was saying
to them
Not yet
do you understand
And
they come
198448	to
Bethsaida
And
they bring
to Him
a blind [man]
and
implore
Him
that
him
He might touch
And
having taken hold of
198463	the
198465	hand
198467	of the
blind [man]
He led forth
him
198472	out
198474	of the
village
and
having spit
198479	upon
198481	the
198483	eyes
of him
having laid
198487	the
hands
upon him
He was asking
him
if
anything
you see
And
having looked up
he was saying
I see
198500	the
men
for
198504	as
trees
I see [them]
walking
Then
again
He laid
198512	the
hands
198515	upon
198517	the
198519	eyes
of him
and
he opened his eyes
and
he was restored
and
he began to see
clearly
everything
And
He sent
him
198533	to
198535	[the] home
of him
saying
Not
198540	into
198542	the
village
may you enter
And
went forth
198548	-
Jesus
and
198552	the
198554	disciples
of Him
198557	into
198559	the
198561	villages
198563	of Caesarea
198565	-
Philippi
And
198569	on
198571	the
way
He was questioning
198575	the
198577	disciples
of Him
saying
to them
Whom
Me
do pronounce
198585	-
men
to be
-
And
they answered
Him
saying
-
John
198596	the
Baptist
and
others
Elijah
others
now
-
198605	one
198607	of the
prophets
And
He
was questioning
them
You
however
whom
Me
do pronounce
to be
Answering
198621	-
Peter
says
to Him
You
are
198628	the
Christ
And
He warned
them
that
no one
they should tell
198637	concerning
Him
And
He began
to teach
them
that
it is necessary for
198646	the
198648	Son
198650	-
of Man
many things
to suffer
and
to be rejected
198657	by
198659	the
elders
and
198663	the
chief priests
and
198667	the
scribes
and
to be killed
and
198673	after
198675	three
days
to rise [again]
And
openly
198681	the
word
He was speaking
And
having taken Him
198687	-
Peter
to him
he began
to rebuke
Him
-
And
having turned
and
having looked upon
198699	the
198701	disciples
of Him
He rebuked
Peter
and
said
Get
198709	behind
Me
Satan
for
not
you have in mind
198716	the
198718	things
of God
but
198722	the
198724	things
of men
And
having called to [Him]
198729	the
crowd
198732	with
198734	the
198736	disciples
of Him
He said
to them
If
anyone
desires
198744	after
Me
to come
let him deny
himself
and
let him take up
198752	the
198754	cross
of him
and
let him follow
Me
Whoever
for
if
might desire
198764	-
198766	life
his
to save
will lose
it
whoever
now
-
will lose
198776	the
198778	life
of him
198781	on account of
Me
and
198785	of the
gospel
he will save
it
What
for
does it profit
a man
to gain
198795	the
198797	world
whole
and
to lose
198802	the
198804	soul
of him
What
for
shall give
a man
198811	[as] an exchange
198813	for the
198815	soul
of him
Whoever
for
if
may be ashamed of
Me
and
198824	-
198826	My
words
198829	in
198832	the
generation
this
198836	-
adulterous
and
sinful
198841	also
198843	the
198845	Son
198847	-
of Man
will be ashamed of
him
when
He shall come
198854	in
198856	the
198858	glory
198860	of the
198862	Father
of Him
198865	with
198867	the
198869	angels
198871	-
holy
And
He was saying
to them
Truly
I say
to you
that
there are
198882	some
here
of those
standing
who
198888	no
not
shall taste
of death
until
-
they see
198896	the
198898	kingdom
198900	-
of God
having come
198904	with
power
And
198908	after
198910	days
six
takes along
198914	-
Jesus
198917	-
Peter
and
198921	-
James
and
John
and
brings up
them
198929	into
198931	a mountain
high
198934	apart
themselves
alone
And
He was transfigured
198940	before
them
and
198944	the
198946	garments
of Him
became
198950	shining
198952	white
exceedingly
such as
198956	a launderer
198958	on
198960	the
earth
not
is able
thus
to whiten
And
appeared
to them
Elijah
198971	with
Moses
and
198975	they were
talking with
198978	-
Jesus
And
answering
198983	-
Peter
says
198987	-
to Jesus
Rabbi
good
it is
for us
here
to be
And
let us make
198998	three
tabernacles
for You
one
and
for Moses
one
and
for Elijah
one
Not
for
he knew
what
he should say
terrified
for
they were
And
there came
a cloud
overshadowing
them
and
there came
a voice
199025	out of
199027	the
cloud
This
is
199032	the
199034	Son
of Me
199037	the
beloved
listen you
to Him
And
suddenly
having looked around
no longer
no one
they saw
except
199049	-
Jesus
alone
199053	with
them
And
descending
of them
199059	from
199061	the
mountain
He instructed
them
that
to no one
what
they had seen
they should tell
if
not
until
199074	the
199076	Son
199078	-
of Man
199081	out from
[the] dead
had risen
And
199086	that
saying
they kept
199090	among
themselves
questioning
what
it is
-
199097	out from
the dead
to rise
And
they were asking
Him
saying
-
Say
199107	the
scribes
that
Elijah
it behooves
to come
first
-
And
He was saying
to them
Elijah
indeed
having come
first
restores
all things
and
how
has it been written
199128	of
199130	the
199132	Son
199134	-
of Man
that
many things
He should suffer
and
be set at naught
But
I say
to you
that
199146	also
Elijah
has come
and
they did
to him
whatever
they desired
as
it has been written
199157	of
him
And
having come
199162	to
199164	the
disciples
they saw
199168	a crowd
great
199171	around
them
and
scribes
arguing
199177	with
them
And
immediately
199182	all
199184	the
crowd
having seen
Him
were greatly amazed
and
running to [Him]
were greeting
Him
And
He asked
them
What
are you disputing
199199	with
them
And
answered
Him
199205	one
199207	out of
199209	the
crowd
Teacher
I brought
199214	the
199216	son
of me
199219	to
You
having
199223	a spirit
mute
and
whenever
if
him
it seizes
it throws down
him
and
he foams
and
gnashes
199237	-
his teeth
and
is withering away
And
I spoke
199244	to the
199246	disciples
of You
that
it
they might cast out
and
not
they had power
-
And
answering
him
He says
199260	O
199262	generation
unbelieving
199265	Until
when
199268	with
you
will I be
199272	Until
when
will I bear with
you
Bring
him
199279	to
Me
And
they brought
him
199285	to
Him
And
having seen
Him
199291	the
spirit
immediately
threw into convulsions
him
and
having fallen
199299	upon
199301	the
ground
he began rolling around
foaming
And
He asked
199308	the
199310	father
of him
199313	How long
a time
is it
that
this
has been
with him
-
And
he said
199324	From
childhood
And
often
199329	both
199331	into
fire
him
it casts
and
199337	into
waters
that
it might destroy
him
But
if
anything
You are able [to do]
help
us
having compassion
199350	on
us
199353	-
And
Jesus
said
to him
-
If
You are able
All things
are possible
to the [one]
believing
Immediately
having cried out
199368	the
199370	father
199372	of the
child
was saying
I believe
help
199378	of me
199380	the
unbelief
Having seen
now
199385	-
Jesus
that
was running together
a crowd
He rebuked
199392	the
199394	spirit
199396	-
unclean
saying
to it
199401	-
199403	Mute
and
deaf
spirit
I
command
you
come
199412	out of
him
and
no more
may you enter
199418	into
him
And
having cried out
and
much
having thrown him into convulsions
it came out
and
he became
199429	as if
dead
in order for
199433	-
many
to say
that
he was dead
199439	-
And
Jesus
having taken
199444	by the
199446	hand
him
raised up
him
and
he arose
And
having entered
He
199456	into
a house
199459	the
199461	disciples
of Him
199464	in
private
were asking
Him
Why
we
not
were able
to cast out
it
And
He said
to them
199478	This
199480	-
kind
199483	by
nothing
is able
to go out
if
not
199490	by
prayer
From there
having gone forth
they were passing
199496	through
199498	-
Galilee
and
not
did He want
that
anyone
should know [it]
He was teaching
for
199509	the
199511	disciples
of Him
and
He was saying
to them
-
199518	The
199520	Son
199522	-
of Man
is delivered
199526	into [the]
199528	hands
of men
and
they will kill
Him
and
having been killed
199536	on the
199538	third
day
He will arise
-
And
they did not understand
199545	the
saying
and
they were afraid
Him
to ask
And
they came
199554	to
Capernaum
And
199558	in
199560	the
house
having been
He was asking
them
What
199567	on
199569	the
way
were you discussing
-
And
they were silent
199576	with
one another
for
they had been discussing
199581	along
199583	the
road
which [was]
greatest
And
having sat down
He called
199591	the
Twelve
and
He says
to them
If
anyone
desires
first
to be
he will be
199603	of all
last
and
199607	of all
servant
And
having taken
a child
He set
it
199615	in
199617	midst
of them
and
having taken in [His] arms
it
He said
to them
Whoever
-
199627	one
199629	-
199631	of such
little children
shall receive
199635	in
199637	the
199639	name
of Me
Me
receives
and
whoever
-
Me
shall receive
not
Me
receives
but
the [One]
having sent
Me
Answered
Him
199658	-
John
Teacher
we saw
someone
199664	in
199666	the
199668	name
of You
casting out
demons
who
not
does follow
us
and
we were forbidding
him
because
not
he was following
us
199684	-
And
Jesus
said
Not
forbid
him
No one
for
there is
who
will do
a work of power
199698	in
199700	the
199702	name
of Me
and
will be able
readily
to speak evil of
Me
Whoever
for
not
is
199714	against
us
199717	for
us
is
Whoever
for

might give to drink
you
199726	a cup
of water
199729	in
name
because
Christâs
you are
truly
I say
to you
that
199739	no
not
shall he lose
199743	the
199745	reward
of him
And
whoever
-
might cause to stumble
199752	one
199755	of the
little ones
these
-
believing
better
it is
for him
rather
if
is put
199767	a millstone
heavy
199770	around
199772	the
199774	neck
of him
and
he has been cast
199779	into
199781	the
sea
And
if
should cause to stumble
you
199788	the
199790	hand
of you
cut off
it
better
it is
for you
crippled
to enter
199800	into
199802	-
life
than
199806	-
199808	two
hands
having
to go away
199813	into
199815	-
hell
199818	into
199820	the
199822	fire
199824	-
unquenchable
And
if
199829	the
199831	foot
of you
should cause to stumble
you
cut off
it
better
it is
for you
to enter
199842	into
199844	-
life
lame
than
199849	the
199851	two
feet
having
to be cast
199856	into
199858	-
hell
And
if
199863	the
199865	eye
of you
should cause to stumble
you
cast out
it
better
for you
it is
with one eye
to enter
199877	into
199879	the
199881	kingdom
199883	-
of God
than
199887	two
eyes
having
to be cast
199892	into
199894	-
hell
where
199898	the
199900	worm
of them
not
dies
and
199906	the
fire
not
is quenched
Everyone
for
with fire
will be salted
Good [is]
199916	the
salt
if
however
199921	the
salt
unsalty
becomes
199926	with
what
it
will you season
Have
199932	in
yourselves
salt
and
be at peace
199938	with
one another
And
from there
having risen up
He comes
199945	into
199947	the
199949	region
199951	-
of Judea
and
199955	beyond
199957	the
Jordan
And
come together
again
crowds
199964	to
Him
and
as
He had been accustomed
again
He was teaching
them
And
having come to [him]
the Pharisees
were demanding
of Him
if
it is lawful
for a husband
a wife
to divorce
testing
Him
-
And
He answering
said
to them
What
you
did command
Moses
-
And
they said
Permitted
Moses
199999	a roll
of divorce
to write
and
to send [her] away
200005	-
But
Jesus
said
to them
200011	Because of
200013	the
200015	hardness of heart
of you
He wrote
for you
200021	the
commandment
this
200025	From
however
200028	[the] beginning
of creation
Male
and
female
He made
them
200036	On account of
this
will leave
a man
200041	the
200043	father
of him
and
200047	-
mother
and
will be
200052	the
two
200055	for
200057	flesh
one
Therefore
no longer
they are
two
but
200065	one
flesh
What
therefore
200070	-
God
has joined together
man
not
let separate
And
200078	in
200080	the
house
again
200084	the
disciples
200087	concerning
this
were asking
Him
And
He says
to them
Whoever
-
shall divorce
200098	the
200100	wife
of him
and
shall marry
another
commits adultery
200107	against
her
And
if
a woman
having divorced
200114	the
200116	husband
of her
should marry
another
she commits adultery
And
they were bringing
to Him
little children
that
them
He might touch
200129	-
But
the disciples
rebuked
them
Having seen
now
200137	-
Jesus
was indignant
and
said
to them
Permit
200145	the
little children
to come
200149	to
Me
not
do hinder
them
200155	To the
for
such
belongs
200160	the
200162	kingdom
200164	-
of God
Truly
I say
to you
whoever
-
not
shall receive
200174	the
200176	kingdom
200178	-
of God
as
a child
200183	no
not
shall enter
200187	into
it
And
having taken [them] in arms
them
He was blessing
having laid
200195	the
hands
200198	on
them
And
going forth
of Him
200204	on
[the] journey
having run up
one
and
having knelt down to
Him
was asking
Him
200214	Teacher
good
what
shall I do
that
200220	life
eternal
I might inherit
200224	-
And
Jesus
said
to him
Why
Me
call you
good
No one [is]
good
if
not
alone
200239	-
God
200242	The
commandments
you know
Not
shall you murder
not
shall you commit adultery
not
shall you steal
not
shall you bear false witness
not
shall you defraud
you shall honor
200257	the
200259	father
of you
and
200263	the
mother
-
And
he was saying
to Him
Teacher
200271	these
all
I have kept
200275	from
200277	[the] youth
of me
200280	-
And
Jesus
having looked upon
him
loved
him
and
said
to him
One thing
to you
is lacking
Go
as much as
you have
sell
and
give
200300	to the
poor
and
you will have
treasure
200306	in
heaven
and
come
follow
Me
-
And
having been sad
200316	at
200318	the
word
he went away
grieving
200323	he was [one]
for
having
200327	possessions
many
And
having looked around
200332	-
Jesus
says
200336	the
200338	disciples
of Him
200341	How
difficultly
those
200345	-
riches
having
200349	into
200351	the
200353	kingdom
200355	-
of God
will enter
200359	-
And
the disciples
were astonished
200364	at
200366	the
200368	words
of Him
200371	-
But
Jesus
again
answering
says
to them
Children
200380	how
difficult
it is
200384	into
200386	the
200388	kingdom
200390	-
of God
to enter
Easier
it is
[for] a camel
200397	through
200399	the
200401	eye
200403	of the
needle
to pass
than [for]
a rich man
200409	into
200411	the
200413	kingdom
200415	-
of God
to enter
-
And
exceedingly
they were astonished
saying
200424	among
themselves
Then
who
is able
to be saved
Having looked on
them
200433	-
Jesus
says
200437	With
men
[it is] impossible
but
not
200443	with
God
all things
for
[are] possible
200449	with
200451	-
God
Began
to say
200456	-
Peter
to Him
Behold
we
have left
all
and
followed
You
Was saying
200468	-
Jesus
Truly
I say
to you
no one
there is
who
has left
house
or
brothers
or
sisters
or
mother
or
father
or
children
or
lands
200491	for the sake
of me
and
200495	because
200497	of the
gospel
if
not
shall take
a hundredfold
now
200505	in
200508	the
time
this
houses
and
brothers
and
sisters
and
mothers
and
children
and
lands
200523	with
persecutions
and
200527	in
200529	the
age
which
is coming
200534	life
eternal
200537	Many
however
will be
first
last
and
200544	the
last
first
They were
then
200550	on
200552	the
way
going up
200556	to
Jerusalem
and
200560	was
going on before
them
200564	-
Jesus
and
they were astonished
those
then
following
were afraid
And
having taken to [Him]
again
200576	the
Twelve
He began
them
to tell
the things
being about
to Him
to happen
-
Behold
we go up
200589	to
Jerusalem
and
200593	the
200595	Son
200597	-
of Man
will be betrayed
200601	to the
chief priests
and
200605	to the
scribes
and
they will condemn
Him
to death
and
will betray
Him
200615	to the
Gentiles
And
they will mock
Him
and
will spit upon
Him
and
will flog
Him
and
will kill
and
200630	on the
200632	third
day
He will rise again
And
come up
to Him
James
and
John
200642	the
200644	sons
of Zebedee
saying to
Him
Teacher
we desire
that
whatever
if
we might ask
you
You would do
for us
-
And
He said
to them
What
do you desire
Me
to do
for you
-
And
they said
to Him
Grant
to us
that
one
200676	of [us]
at
[Your] right hand
and
one
200682	at
[Your] left hand
we might sit
200686	in
200688	the
200690	glory
of You
200693	-
And
Jesus
said
to them
Not
you know
what
you ask
Are you able
to drink
200705	the
cup
which
I
drink
and
200712	the
baptism
which
I
am baptized
to be baptized [with]
-
And
they said
to Him
We are able
200724	-
And
Jesus
said
to them
200730	The
cup
which
I
drink
you will drink
and
200738	the
baptism
which
I
am baptized
you will be baptized [with]
-
but
to sit
200748	at
200750	[the] right hand
of Me
or
200754	at
[the] left hand
not
is
Mine
to give
but [to those]
for whom
it has been prepared
And
having heard [this]
200766	the
ten
began
to be indignant
200771	about
James
and
John
And
having called near
them
200779	-
Jesus
says
to them
You know
that
those
being accounted
to rule over
200789	the
Gentiles
exercise lordship over
them
and
200795	those
200797	great ones
of them
exercise authority over
them
Not
thus
however
shall it be
200806	among
you
Instead
whoever
-
desires
great
to become
200815	among
you
will be
200819	your
servant
and
whoever
-
desires
200826	among
you
to become
first
will be
200832	of all
slave
200835	Even
for
200838	the
200840	Son
200842	-
of Man
not
came
to be served
but
to serve
and
to give
200852	the
200854	life
of Him
200857	[as] a ransom
200859	for
many
And
they come
200864	to
Jericho
And
as was going out
He
200870	from
Jericho
and
200874	the
200876	disciples
of Him
and
200880	a crowd
large
200883	the
200885	son
of Timaeus
Bartimaeus
200889	blind
beggar
was sitting
200893	beside
200895	the
road
And
having heard
that
Jesus
200902	of
Nazareth
it is
he began
to cry out
and
to say
200910	Son
of David
Jesus
have mercy on
me
And
were rebuking
him
many
that
he should be silent
-
but
200924	much
more
he kept crying out
200928	Son
of David
have mercy on
me
And
having stopped
200935	-
Jesus
commanded
to be called
him
And
they call
200943	the
blind [man]
saying
to him
Take courage
Rise up
He calls
you
-
And
having cast away
200955	the
200957	cloak
of him
having risen up
he came
200962	to
200964	-
Jesus
And
answering
him
200970	-
Jesus
says
What
to you
do you desire
I should do
200978	-
And
the blind [man]
said
to Him
Rabboni
that
I may receive sight
And
200988	-
Jesus
said
to him
Go
200994	the
200996	faith
of you
has healed
you
And
immediately
he received sight
and
he began following
Him
201007	on
201009	the
way
And
when
they drew near
201015	to
Jerusalem
201018	to
Bethphage
and
Bethany
201023	near
201025	the
201027	Mount
201029	-
of Olives
He sends
201033	two
201035	of the
201037	disciples
of Him
and
says
to them
Go
201044	into
201046	the
village
201049	-
201051	before
you
and
immediately
entering
201057	into
it
you will find
a colt
having been tied
201063	upon
which
201066	no one
not yet
of men
has sat
having untied
it
also
bring [it]
And
if
anyone
to you
says
Why
are you doing
this
say
201084	the
Lord
201087	of it
need
has
and
soon
it
He will send
back
here
And
they departed
and
found
the colt
having been tied
201103	at
the door
outside
201107	by
201109	the
street
and
they untied
it
And
201116	some
of those
there
standing
were saying
to them
What
are you doing
untying
201126	the
colt
-
And
they spoke
to them
as
had commanded
201135	-
Jesus
and
they allowed
them
And
they led
201143	the
colt
201146	to
201148	-
Jesus
and
they cast upon
it
201154	the
201156	cloaks
of them
and
He sat
201161	on
it
And
many
201166	the
201168	cloaks
of them
spread
201172	on
201174	the
road
others
then
branches
having been cut down
201181	from
201183	the
fields
And
those
going before
and
those
following
were crying out
Hosanna
Blessed is
the [One]
coming
201197	in [the]
201199	name
of [the] Lord
Blessed
201203	[is] the
201205	coming
201207	kingdom
201209	of the
201211	father
of us
David
Hosanna
201216	in
201218	the
highest
And
He entered
201223	into
Jerusalem
201226	into
201228	the
temple
and
having looked around on
all things
late
already
being
201237	the
hour
He went out
201241	to
Bethany
201244	with
201246	the
Twelve
And
201250	on the
next day
having gone out
they
201255	from
Bethany
He was hungry
And
having seen
a fig tree
201262	from
afar
having
leaves
He went
if
perhaps
anything
He will find
201272	on
it
And
having come
201277	to
it
nothing
He found
if
not
leaves
201285	the
for
season
not
it was
of figs
And
answering
He said
to it
No more
201297	to
201299	the
age
201302	of
you
no one
fruit
may eat
And
were listening
201310	the
201312	disciples
of Him
And
they come
201317	to
Jerusalem
And
having entered
201322	into
201324	the
temple
He began
to cast out
201329	those
selling
and
those
buying
201335	in
201337	the
temple
and
201341	the
201343	tables
201345	of the
money changers
and
201349	the
201351	seats
of those
selling
201355	the
doves
He overturned
And
not
He would permit
that
anyone
should carry
a vessel
201366	through
201368	the
temple
And
He began teaching
and
was saying
to them
Not
has it been written
-
201379	The
201381	house
of Me
201384	a house
of prayer
will be called
201388	for all
201390	the
nations
You
however
have made
it
201397	a den
of robbers
And
heard [it]
201402	the
chief priests
and
201406	the
scribes
and
they were seeking
how
Him
they might destroy
they were afraid of
for
Him
201417	all
for
201420	the
crowd
was astonished
201424	at
201426	the
201428	teaching
of Him
And
when
evening
came
they were going forth
201436	out of
201438	the
city
And
passing by
in the morning
they saw
201445	the
fig tree
having been dried up
201449	from [the]
roots
And
having remembered
201454	-
Peter
says
to Him
Rabbi
look
201461	the
fig tree
that
You cursed
is dried up
And
answering
201469	-
Jesus
says
to them
Have
201475	faith
from God
Truly
I say
to you
that
whoever
-
shall say
201486	to the
mountain
this
Be you taken away
and
be you cast
201493	into
201495	the
sea
and
not
shall doubt
201501	in
201503	the
201505	heart
of him
but
shall believe
that
what
he says
takes place
it will be done
for him
201516	Because of
this
I say
to you
201521	all things
whatever
praying
also
you ask
believe
that
you receive
and
it will be
to you
And
when
you may stand
praying
forgive
if
anything
you have
201541	against
anyone
so that
201545	also
201547	the
201549	Father
of you
201552	who [is]
201554	in
201556	the
heavens
might forgive
you
201561	the
201563	trespasses
of you
And
they come
again
201569	to
Jerusalem
And
201573	in
201575	the
temple
is walking
as He
come
201581	to
Him
201584	the
chief priests
and
201588	the
scribes
and
201592	the
elders
And
they were saying
to Him
201598	By
201600	what
authority
these things
are You doing
Or
who
You
gave
201610	the
authority
this
that
these things
You should do
201617	-
And
Jesus
said
to them
I will ask
you
201625	one
question
and
you answer
Me
and
I will tell
you
201634	by
201636	what
authority
these things
I do
201641	The
baptism
201644	-
of John
201647	from
heaven
was it
or
201652	from
men
Answer
Me
And
they began reasoning
201659	with
themselves
saying
If
we should say
201665	From
heaven
He will say
201669	Because of
why
then
not
did you believe
him
But
should we say
201678	From
men
they were afraid of
201682	the
people
all
for
were holding
201688	-
John
truly
that
a prophet
he was
And
answering
201697	-
to Jesus
they say
Not
do we know
And
201704	-
Jesus
says
to them
Neither
I
tell
you
201713	by
201715	what
authority
these things
I do
And
He began
to them
201723	in
parables
to speak
A vineyard
a man
planted
and
he placed around [it]
a fence
and
dug
a wine vat
and
built
a tower
and
rented out
it
to farmers
and
traveled abroad
And
he sent
201747	to
201749	the
farmers
201752	at the
due time
a servant
that
201757	from
201759	the
farmers
he might receive
201763	from
201765	the
201767	fruit
201769	of the
vineyard
But
having taken
him
they beat [him]
and
sent [him] away
empty-handed
And
again
he sent
201782	to
them
201785	another
servant
and him
they struck on the head
and
treated shamefully
And
another
He sent
and him
they killed
also
201798	many
others
some
indeed
beating
some
then
killing
Yet
201808	one
having
201811	son
beloved
he sent
him
last
201817	to
them
saying
-
They will have respect for
201823	the
201825	son
of me
201828	Those
however
201831	-
farmers
201834	to
themselves
said
-
This
is
201841	the
heir
come
let us kill
him
and
ours
will be
201850	the
inheritance
And
having taken
they killed
him
and
cast forth
him
201860	outside
201862	the
vineyard
What
will do
201867	the
201869	master
201871	of the
vineyard
He will come
and
will destroy
201877	the
farmers
and
will give
201882	the
vineyard
to others
Not even
201888	the
Scripture
this
have you read
[The] stone
which
rejected
those
building
this
has become
201900	the
201902	chief
corner
201905	from [the]
Lord
was
this
and
it is
marvelous
201913	in
201915	[the] eyes
of us
And
they were seeking
Him
to lay hold of
and
they feared
201924	the
crowd
they knew
for
that
201930	against
them
201933	the
parable
He had spoken
And
having left
Him
they went away
And
they send
201943	to
Him
201946	some
201948	of the
Pharisees
and
201952	of the
Herodians
that
Him
they might catch
in discourse
And
having come
they say
to Him
Teacher
we know
that
true
You are
and
not
there is care
to You
201972	about
no one
not
for
You look
201978	on [the]
201980	appearance
of men
but
201984	on the basis of
[the] truth
201987	the
201989	way
201991	-
of God
teach
Is it lawful
to give
tribute
to Caesar
or
not
Should we pay
or
not
pay
-
And
knowing
202008	of them
202010	the
hypocrisy
He said
to them
Why
Me
do you test
Bring
Me
a denarius
that
I might see [it]
-
And
they brought [it]
And
He says
to them
Whose [is]
202031	the
likeness
this
and
202036	the
inscription
-
And
they said
to Him
Caesarâs
202044	-
And
Jesus
said
to them
202050	The things
of Caesar
give back
to Caesar
and
202056	the things
202058	-
of God
202061	-
to God
And
they were amazed
202066	at
Him
And
come
Sadducees
202072	to
Him
who
say
a resurrection
not
there is
and
they began questioning
Him
saying
Teacher
Moses
wrote
for us
that
if
202090	of anyone
a brother
should die
and
leave behind
a wife
and
not
leave
children
that
should take
202103	the
202105	brother
of him
202108	the
wife
and
raise up
seed
202114	for the
202116	brother
of him
202119	Seven
brothers
there were
and
202124	the
first
took
a wife
and
dying
not
left
seed
And
202135	the
second
took
her
and
died
not
having left
seed
and
202146	the
third
likewise
And
202151	the
seven
not
left
seed
202157	Last
of all
202160	also
202162	the
woman
died
202166	In
202168	the
resurrection
when
they rise
202174	of which
of them
will she be
wife
202179	-
For
the seven
had
her
as wife
Was saying
to them
202188	-
Jesus
Not
202192	because of
this
do you err
not
knowing
202198	the
Scriptures
nor
202202	the
202204	power
202206	-
of God
When
for
202211	out from
[the] dead
they rise
neither
do they marry
nor
are given in marriage
but
are
202221	like
202223	angels
202225	in
202227	the
heavens
202230	Concerning
now
202233	the
dead
that
they rise
not
have you read
202240	in
202242	the
202244	book
of Moses
202247	on
202249	the
bush
how
spoke
to him
202255	-
God
saying
I [am]
202260	the
202262	God
of Abraham
and
202266	God
of Isaac
and
202270	God
of Jacob
Not
He is
202275	God
of [the] dead
but
of [the] living
Greatly
you err
And
having come up
202284	one
202286	of the
scribes
having heard
them
reasoning together
having seen
that
well
He answered
them
he questioned
Him
Which
is
202301	commandment
202303	[the] first
of all
Answered
202307	-
Jesus
The
foremost
is
Hear this
O Israel
[The] Lord
202316	-
202318	God
of us
202321	[the] Lord
One
is
and
you shall love
[the] Lord
202328	-
202330	God
of you
202333	with
202335	all
202337	the
202339	heart
of you
and
202343	with
202345	all
202347	the
202349	soul
of you
and
202353	with
202355	all
202357	the
202359	mind
of you
and
202363	with
202365	all
202367	the
202369	strength
of you
[The] second
this
You shall love
202375	the
202377	neighbor
of you
as
yourself
Greater
than these
202384	another
commandment
not
there is
And
said
to Him
202392	the
scribe
Right
Teacher
202397	according to
truth
You have spoken
that
One
He is
and
not
there is
another
202408	besides
Him
and
-
to love
Him
202415	with
202417	all
202419	the
heart
and
202423	with
202425	all
202427	the
understanding
and
202431	with
202433	all
202435	the
strength
and
-
to love
202441	the
neighbor
as
oneself
more important
is
202448	than all
202450	the
burnt offerings
and
sacrifices
And
202456	-
Jesus
having seen
him
that
wisely
he answered
said
to him
Not
far
are you
202469	from
202471	the
202473	kingdom
202475	-
of God
And
no one
no longer
dared
Him
to question
And
answering
202486	-
Jesus
was saying
teaching
202491	in
202493	the
temple
How
say
202498	the
scribes
that
202502	the
Christ
202505	[the] son
of David
is
202509	Himself
David
said
202513	by
202515	the
202517	Spirit
202519	-
Holy
Said
[the] Lord
202524	to the
202526	Lord
of me
Sit
202530	at
202532	[the] right hand
of Me
until
-
I place
202538	of the
202540	enemies
of You
202543	[as] a footstool
202545	of the
202547	feet
of You
202550	Himself
David
calls
Him
Lord
then
how
202558	of him
is He
son
And
202563	the
202565	great
crowd
was listening
to Him
gladly
And
202572	in
202574	the
202576	teaching
of Him
He was saying
Beware
202581	of
202583	the
scribes
-
desiring
202588	in
robes
to walk about
and
202593	greetings
202595	in
202597	the
marketplaces
and
202601	first seats
202603	in
202605	the
synagogues
and
202609	first places
202611	at
202613	the
feasts
those
devouring
202618	the
202620	houses
202622	of the
widows
and
as a pretext
at great length
praying
These
will receive
202631	greater
judgment
And
having sat down
202636	opposite
202638	the
treasury
He was watching
how
202643	the
crowd
cast
money
202648	into
202650	the
treasury
and
202654	many
rich
were casting [in]
much
And
having come
202661	one
202663	widow
poor
cast [in]
202667	lepta
two
which
is
a kodrantes
And
having called to [Him]
202675	the
202677	disciples
of Him
He says
to them
Truly
I say
to you
that
202687	the
widow
this
202691	-
poor
more
202695	than all
has cast [in]
of those
casting
202700	into
202702	the
treasury
All
for
202707	out of
that which
was abounding
to them
cast [in]
she
however
202715	out of
202717	the
202719	poverty
of her
202722	all
as much as
she had
cast [in]
202727	all
202729	the
202731	livelihood
of her
And
going forth
of Him
202737	out of
202739	the
temple
says
to Him
202744	one
202746	of the
202748	disciples
of Him
Teacher
behold
202753	what
stones
and
202757	what
buildings
And
202761	-
Jesus
said
to him
See you
202767	these
202769	-
202771	great
buildings
202774	No
not
shall be left
stone
202779	upon
stone
which
202783	no
not
shall be thrown down
And
sitting
of Him
202790	upon
202792	the
202794	Mount
202796	-
of Olives
202799	opposite
202801	the
temple
asked
Him
202806	in
private
Peter
and
James
and
John
and
Andrew
Tell
us
when
these things
will be
And
what [will be]
202823	the
sign
when
are going
202828	these things
to be accomplished
all
202832	-
And
Jesus
began
to say
to them
Take heed
lest
anyone
you
mislead
Many
will come
202846	in
202848	the
202850	name
of Me
saying
-
I
am [He]
and
many
they will mislead
When
then
you shall hear of
wars
and
202865	rumors
of wars
not
be disturbed
it must
come to pass
but
not yet [is]
202874	the
end
Will rise up
for
nation
202880	against
nation
and
kingdom
202885	against
kingdom
There will be
earthquakes
202890	throughout
places
there will be
famines
202895	[The] beginning
of birth pains [are]
these
Take heed
however
you
to yourselves
they will betray
you
202905	to
courts
and
202909	in
synagogues
you will be beaten
and
202914	before
governors
and
kings
you will stand
202920	because
of Me
202923	for
202925	a testimony
to them
And
202929	to
202931	all
202933	the
nations
first
it behooves
to proclaim
202939	the
gospel
And
when
they might lead away
you
delivering [you] up
not
be anxious beforehand
what
you should say
but
whatever
if
might be given
to you
202956	in
202958	that
202960	-
hour
that
speak
not
for
are
you
those
speaking
but
202972	the
202974	Spirit
202976	-
Holy
And
will deliver up
brother
brother
202983	to
death
and
father
child
and
will rise up
children
202992	against
parents
and
will put to death
them
And
202999	you will be
hated
203002	by
all
203005	on account of
203007	the
203009	name
of Me
the [one]
however
having endured
203015	to
[the] end
he
will be saved
When
then
you see
203023	the
203025	abomination
203027	of the
desolation
standing
where
not
it should
the [one]
reading
let him understand
then
203038	those
203040	in
203042	-
Judea
let them flee
203046	to
203048	the
mountains
203051	the [one]
203053	upon
203055	the
housetop
not
let him come down
nor
go in
anything
to take
203064	out of
203066	the
203068	house
of him
and
203072	the [one]
203074	in
203076	the
field
not
let him return
203081	to
203083	the things
behind
to take
203087	the
203089	clothing
of him
Woe
then
to those
203095	in
womb
having
and
to the [ones]
nursing infants
203102	in
203104	those
203106	-
days
Pray
then
that it
not
might be
in winter
will be [in]
for
203118	the
days
those
tribulation
such as
never
has been
the like
203127	from [the]
203129	beginning
of creation
which
created
203134	-
God
203137	until
203139	-
now
and
203143	never
not
shall be
And
if
not
had shortened
[the] Lord
203152	the
days
no
-
there would have been saved
203158	any
flesh
but
203162	on account of
203164	the
elect
whom
He chose
He has shortened
203170	the
days
And
then
if
anyone
to you
says
Behold
here [is]
203181	the
Christ
Behold
there
not
you shall believe [it]
There will arise
for
false Christs
and
false prophets
and
will give
signs
and
wonders
203198	so as
-
to deceive
if
possible
203204	the
elect
You
however
take heed
I have foretold
to you
all things
But
203214	in
203216	those
203218	-
days
203221	after
203224	the
tribulation
those
203228	The
sun
will be darkened
and
203233	the
moon
not
will give
203238	the
203240	light
of it
and
203244	the
stars
203247	will be
203249	out of
203251	the
heaven
falling
and
203256	the
powers
203259	that [are]
203261	in
203263	the
heavens
will be shaken
And
then
will they see
203270	the
203272	Son
203274	-
of Man
coming
203278	in
[the] clouds
203281	with
203283	power
great
and
glory
And
then
He will send
203291	the
angels
and
will gather together
203296	the
203298	elect
of Him
203301	from
203303	the
203305	four
winds
203308	from [the]
203310	end
of earth
203313	to [the]
203315	end
of heaven
203318	Of
now
203321	the
fig tree
learn
203325	the
parable
When
already
203330	the
203332	branch
of it
tender
has become
and
it puts forth
203339	the
leaves
you know
that
near
203345	the
summer
is
So
203350	also
you
when
you see
these things
coming to pass
know
that
near
He is
203361	at [the]
doors
Truly
I say
to you
that
203368	no
not
will have passed away
203373	the
generation
this
203377	until
that
203380	these things
all
shall have taken place
203384	The
heaven
and
203388	the
earth
will pass away
203392	-
but
203395	the words
of Me
in no way
will pass away
203400	Concerning
now
203404	the
day
that
or
203409	the
hour
no one
knows
not even
203415	the
203417	angels
203419	in
heaven
nor
203423	the
Son
if
not
203428	the
Father
Take heed
watch
not
you know
for
when
203437	the
time
is
[It is] like
203442	a man
going on a journey
having left
203446	the
203448	house
of him
and
having given
203453	the
203455	servants
of him
203458	-
authority
to each one
203462	the
203464	work
of him
And
203468	the
doorkeeper
he commanded
that
he should keep watch
Watch
therefore
not
you know
for
when
203480	the
203482	master
203484	of the
house
comes
or
at evening
or
at midnight
or
when the rooster crows
or
morning
lest
having come
suddenly
he should find
you
sleeping
What
now
to you
I say
to all
I say
Watch
It would be
now
203511	the
Passover
and
203515	the
[Feast of] Unleavened Bread
203518	after
203520	two
days
And
were seeking
203525	the
chief priests
and
203529	the
scribes
how
Him
203534	by
stealth
having taken
they might kill [Him]
They were saying
for
Not
203542	during
203544	the
feast
lest
ever
there will be
203550	an uproar
203552	of the
people
And
being
of Him
203558	in
Bethany
203561	in
203563	the
203565	house
of Simon
203568	the
leper
having reclined
of Him
came
a woman
having
203576	an alabaster flask
203578	of fragrant oil
203581	of nard
pure
of great price
having broken
203586	the
alabaster flask
she poured [it] on
203590	His
203592	-
head
203595	Were
now
some
indignant
203600	within
themselves
203603	To
what
203608	the
waste
this
203612	of the
fragrant oil
has been made
Could
for
203618	this
203620	-
fragrant oil
to have been sold
203624	for above
203626	denarii
three hundred
and
to have been given
203631	to the
poor
And
they were grumbling
at her
203637	-
And
Jesus
said
Leave alone
her
why
to her
trouble
do you cause
203648	A good
work
she did
203652	toward
Me
Always
for
203657	the
poor
you have
203661	with
you
and
whenever
you desire
you are able
them
good
to do
Me
however
not
always
do you have
What
she could
she did
She came beforehand
to anoint
203681	the
203683	body
of Me
203686	for
203688	the
burial
Truly
now
I say
to you
wherever
if
shall be proclaimed
203698	the
gospel
203701	in
203703	whole
203705	the
world
203708	also
what
has done
this [woman]
will be spoken of
203714	for
203716	a memorial
of her
And
Judas
Iscariot
203722	-
203724	one
203726	of the
Twelve
went away
203730	to
203732	the
chief priests
that
Him
he might betray
to them
-
And
having heard
they rejoiced
and
promised
him
money
to give
And
he was seeking
how
Him
conveniently
he might deliver up
And
203755	on the
203758	first
day
203761	-
of unleavened [bread]
when
203765	the
Passover lamb
they were to sacrifice
say
to Him
203771	the
203773	disciples
of Him
Where
do You desire [that]
having gone
we should prepare
that
You may eat
203782	the
Passover
And
He sends forth
203787	two
203789	of the
203791	disciples
of Him
and
says
to them
Go
203798	into
203800	the
city
and
will meet
you
203806	a man
203808	a pitcher
of water
carrying
Follow
him
And
wherever
if
he might enter
say
203819	to the
master of the house
that
203823	the
Teacher
says
Where
is
203829	the
203831	guest room
of Me
where
203835	the
Passover
203838	with
203840	the
203842	disciples
of Me
I may eat
And
he
you
will show
203852	an upper room
large
having been furnished
[and] ready
And
there
prepare
for us
And
went away
203863	-
his disciples
and
came
203868	into
203870	the
city
and
found
as
He had said
to them
and
they prepared
203880	the
Passover
And
evening
having arrived
He comes
203887	with
203889	the
Twelve
And
as were reclining
they
and
were eating
203897	-
Jesus
said
Truly
I say
to you
that
203905	one
203907	of
you
will betray
Me
who
is eating
203914	with
Me
They began
to be grieved
and
to say
to Him
203922	one
203924	by
one
Surely not
I
-
And
He said
to them
203933	[It is] one of
203935	the
Twelve
who
is dipping
203940	with
Me
203943	in
203945	the
bowl
For
203949	-
indeed
203952	the Son
203954	-
of Man
goes
as
it has been written
203960	concerning
Him
woe
however
203966	to the
man
that
203970	by
whom
203973	the
203975	Son
203977	-
of Man
is betrayed
better
for him [it were]
if
not
had been born
203987	the
man
that
And
they were eating
of them
having taken
bread
having spoken a blessing
He broke
and
gave
to them
and
said
Take
this
is
204006	the
204008	body
of Me
And
having taken
the cup
having given thanks
He gave [it]
to them
and
they drank
204019	of
it
all
And
He said
to them
This
is
204028	the
204031	blood
of Me
204034	of the
covenant
which
is being poured out
204039	for
many
Truly
I say
to you
that
no more
204047	never
not
will I drink
204051	of
204053	the
204055	fruit
204057	of the
vine
204060	until
204063	the
day
that
when
it
I drink
anew
204071	in
204073	the
204075	kingdom
204077	-
of God
And
having sung a hymn
they went out
204083	to
204085	the
204087	Mount
204089	-
of Olives
And
says
to them
204095	-
Jesus
-
All
you will fall away
for
it has been written
I will strike
204104	the
shepherd
and
204108	the
sheep
will be scattered
But
204113	after
-
having arisen
I
will go before
you
204120	into
204122	-
Galilee
204125	-
And
Peter
was saying
to Him
If
204132	even
all
will fall away
yet
not
I
And
says
to him
204142	-
Jesus
Truly
I say
to you
that
yourself
now
204151	this
204153	-
night
before
that
twice
[the] rooster
crows
three times
Me
you will deny
-
And
emphatically
he kept saying
If
it is needful
of me
to die with
You
204173	no
not
You
will I deny
Likewise
now
204180	also
all
of them were saying
And
they come
204186	to
a place
204189	of which
204191	the
name [is]
Gethsemane
and
He says
204197	to the
204199	disciples
of Him
Sit
here
while
I shall pray
And
He takes
204208	-
Peter
and
204212	-
James
and
204216	-
John
204219	with
Him
and
He began
to be greatly awe-struck
and
deeply distressed
And
He says
to them
Very sorrowful
is
204232	the
204234	soul
of Me
204237	even to
death
remain
here
and
watch
And
having gone forward
a little
He fell
204248	upon
204250	the
ground
and
was praying
that
if
possible
it is
might pass
204260	from
Him
204263	the
hour
And
He was saying
Abba
204269	-
Father
all things [are]
possible
to You
take away
204277	the
cup
this
204281	from
Me
but
not
what
I
will
but
what
You
And
He comes
and
finds
them
sleeping
And
He says
204300	-
to Peter
Simon
are you asleep
Not
were you able
204307	one
hour
to watch
Watch
and
pray
so that
not
you may enter
204317	into
temptation
204320	The
indeed
spirit
[is] willing
204325	-
but
the flesh
weak
And
again
having gone away
He prayed
204334	the
204336	same
thing
having said
And
again
having returned
he found
them
sleeping
204346	Were
for
204349	of them
204351	the
eyes
heavy
and
not
they knew
what
they should answer
Him
And
He comes
204363	the
third time
and
says
to them
Are you sleeping
204370	-
still
and
taking your rest
It is enough
has come
204377	the
hour
behold
is delivered up
204382	the
204384	Son
204386	-
of Man
204389	into
204391	the
204393	hands
204395	of the
sinful
Rise
let us go
behold
the [one]
betraying
Me
has drawn near
And
immediately
while yet
of Him
speaking
comes up
204411	-
Judas
204414	one
204416	of the
Twelve
and
204420	with
Him
204423	a crowd
204425	with
swords
and
clubs
204430	from
204432	the
chief priests
and
204436	the
scribes
and
204440	the
elders
Had given
then
the [one]
delivering up
Him
a sign
to them
saying
Whomever
-
I shall kiss
He
is
seize
Him
and
lead [Him] away
securely
And
having arrived
immediately
having come up
to Him
he says
Rabbi
And
he kissed
Him
-
And
they laid
204474	the
hands
on Him
and
seized
Him
One
then
204483	a certain
of those
standing by
having drawn
204488	the
sword
struck
204492	the
204494	servant
204496	of the
high priest
and
cut off
204501	of him
204503	the
ear
And
answering
204508	-
Jesus
said
to them
As
204514	against
a robber
are you come out
204518	with
swords
and
clubs
to capture
Me
204525	Every
day
I was
204529	with
you
204532	in
204534	the
temple
teaching
and
not
you did seize
Me
But [it is]
that
may be fulfilled
204545	the
Scriptures
And
having left
Him
fled
all
And
204554	[a] young man
certain
was following
Him
having cast
a linen cloth
204561	about
[his] naked [body]
and
they seize
him
-
and
having left behind
204570	the
linen cloth
naked
he fled
And
they led away
204577	-
Jesus
204580	to
204582	the
high priest
And
come together
204587	all
204589	the
chief priests
and
204593	the
elders
and
204597	the
scribes
And
204601	-
Peter
204604	from
afar off
followed
Him
204609	as far as
204611	within
204613	to
204615	the
204617	court
204619	of the
high priest
and
204623	he was
sitting
204626	with
204628	the
officers
and
warming himself
204633	at
204635	the
fire
204638	-
And
the chief priests
and
204643	all
204645	the
Council
were seeking
204649	against
204651	-
Jesus
testimony
204655	to
-
put to death
Him
but
not
they were finding [any]
Many
for
were bearing false testimony
204666	against
Him
but
alike
204671	their
testimonies
not
were
And
some
having risen up
were bearing false testimony
204680	against
Him
saying
-
We
heard
Him
saying
-
I
will destroy
204693	the
temple
this
204697	the [one]
made with hands
and
204701	in
204703	three
days
204706	another
not made with hands
I will build
And
neither
thus
alike
was
204715	the
204717	testimony
of them
And
having stood up
204722	the
high priest
204725	in
the midst
he questioned
204729	-
Jesus
saying
Not
answer You
nothing
What [is it]
these
You
testify against
-
But
He was silent
and
not
did He answer
nothing
Again
204748	the
high priest
was questioning
Him
and
says
to Him
You
are
204758	the
Christ
204761	the
204763	Son
204765	of the
Blessed [One]
204768	-
And
Jesus
said
I
am
And
you will see
204777	the
204779	Son
204781	-
of Man
204784	at [the]
204786	right hand
sitting
204789	of
Power
and
coming
204794	with
204796	the
204798	clouds
204800	of
heaven
204803	-
And
the high priest
having torn
204808	the
204810	garments
of him
says
What
any more
204816	need
have we
of witnesses
You heard
204821	the
blasphemy
What
to you
does it appear
204827	-
And
all
condemned
Him
deserving
to be
of death
And
began
some
to spit upon
Him
and
to cover up
204843	of Him
204845	the
face
and
to strike
Him
and
to say
to Him
Prophesy
And
204856	the
officers
with the palms
Him
received
And
being
204864	-
Peter
below
204868	in
204870	the
courtyard
comes
204874	one
204876	of the
204878	servant girls
204880	of the
high priest
and
having seen
204885	-
Peter
warming himself
having looked at
him
she says
204892	Also
you
204895	with
204897	the
Nazarene
were
204901	-
Jesus
-
But
he denied [it]
saying
Neither
I know
nor even
understand
you
what
say
And
he went forth
out
204918	into
204920	the
porch
And
204924	the
servant girl
having seen
him
began
again
to say
to those
standing by
-
This
204936	[one] of
them
is
-
But
again
he denied
And
204945	after
a little
again
those
standing by
were saying
204952	-
to Peter
Truly
204956	of
them
you are
204960	also
for
a Galilean
you are
-
But
he began
to curse
and
to swear
-
Not
I know
204975	the
man
this
whom
you speak of
And
immediately
204983	for
the second time
a rooster
crowed
And
remembered
204990	-
Peter
204993	the
word
that
had said
to him
204999	-
Jesus
-
Before
[the] rooster
twice
crows
three times
Me
you will deny
And
having broken down
he began to weep
And
early
in the morning
a counsel
having formed
205018	the
chief priests
205021	with
205023	the
elders
and
scribes
and
205029	all
205031	the
Council
having bound
205035	-
Jesus
they led [Him] away
and
delivered [Him]
to Pilate
And
questioned
Him
205045	-
Pilate
You
are
205050	the
205052	King
205054	of the
Jews
-
And
answering
to him
He says
You
have said
And
were accusing
Him
205067	the
chief priests
of many things
205071	-
And
Pilate
again
began to question
Him
saying
Not
answer You
nothing
See
how many things
You
they testify against
205086	-
But
Jesus
no longer
nothing
answered
so as
to amaze
205095	-
Pilate
205098	At
then
[the] feast
he used to release
to them
205104	one
prisoner
whom
they requested
205109	There was
then
the [one]
called
Barabbas
205115	with
205117	the
rebels
having been bound
who
205122	in
205124	the
insurrection
murder
had committed
And
having cried out
205131	the
crowd
began
to beg [him to do]
as usually
he did
for them
205139	-
But
Pilate
answered
them
saying
Wish you [that]
I should release
to you
205149	the
205151	King
205153	of the
Jews
He was aware
for
that
205159	because of
envy
had delivered up
Him
205164	the
chief priests
205167	-
But
the chief priests
stirred up
205172	the
crowd
so that
instead
205177	-
Barabbas
he might release
to them
205182	-
And
Pilate
again
answering
was saying
to them
What
then
I should do
to Him
you call
205195	the
205197	King
205199	of the
Jews
-
And
again
they cried out
Crucify
Him
205208	-
And
Pilate
was saying
to them
205214	What
indeed
did He commit
evil
-
But
much more
they shouted
Crucify
Him
205225	-
And
Pilate
desiring
205230	to the
crowd
205233	that which [was]
satisfactory
to do
released
to them
205239	-
Barabbas
and
he delivered
205244	-
Jesus
having flogged [him]
that
He might be crucified
205250	-
And
the soldiers
led away
him
205256	into
205258	the
palace
that
is
[the] Praetorium
and
they call together
205266	all
205268	the
cohort
And
they put on
Him
purple
and
placed on
Him
having twisted together
205279	of thorns
a crown
and
they began
to salute
Him
Hail
205287	King
205289	of the
Jews
And
they kept striking
205294	His
205296	-
head
with a reed
and
spitting on
Him
and
bending
205305	the
knees
they were kneeling down
to Him
And
when
they had mocked
Him
they took off
him
205316	the
purple
and
put on
Him
205322	the
205324	garments
His
And
they are leading out
him
that
they might crucify
Him
And
they compel
205336	passing by
one
Simon
of Cyrene
coming
205342	from
the country
205345	the
205347	father
of Alexander
and
Rufus
that
he might carry
205354	the
205356	cross
of Him
And
they bring
Him
205362	to
205364	-
Golgotha
a place
which
205369	is
translated
205372	of a Skull
Place
And
they were offering
Him
205378	having been mixed with myrrh
wine
He
however
not
did take [it]
And
having crucified
Him
also
they divided
205390	the
205392	garments
of Him
casting
lots
205397	for
them
who
what
should take
It was
then
205405	[the] hour
third
and
they crucified
Him
And
205412	there was
205414	the
205416	inscription
205418	of the
205420	accusation
against Him
having been written
205424	The
205426	King
205428	of the
Jews
And
205432	with
Him
they crucify
205436	two
robbers
one
205440	at
[the] right hand
and
one
205445	at [the]
205447	left
of Him
And
those
passing by
were railing at
Him
shaking
205456	the
205458	heads
of them
and
saying
Aha
The [One]
destroying
205466	the
temple
and
building [it]
205471	in
205473	three
days
save
Yourself
having descended
205479	from
205481	the
cross
Likewise
205485	also
205487	the
chief priests
mocking
205491	among
one another
205494	with
205496	the
scribes
were saying
Others
He saved
Himself
not
He is able
to save
205506	The
Christ
205509	the
205511	King
of Israel
let Him descend
now
205516	from
205518	the
cross
that
we might see
and
believe
And
those
being crucified
205528	with
Him
were upbraiding
Him
And
having arrived
205535	[the] hour
sixth
darkness
came
205540	over
205542	all
205544	the
land
205547	until
205549	[the] hour
ninth
And
205553	at the
205555	ninth
hour
cried out
205559	-
Jesus
205562	in a voice
loud
Eloi
Eloi
lema
sabachthani
Which
205570	is
translated
205573	-
205575	God
of Me
205578	-
205580	God
of Me
205583	to
why
have You forsaken
Me
And
205589	some
of those
standing by
having heard
were saying
Behold
Elijah
He calls
Having run
then
one
and
having filled
a sponge
with vinegar
having put [it] on
a reed
gave to drink
him
saying
Let be
let us see
if
comes
Elijah
to take down
him
205617	-
But
Jesus
having uttered
205622	a cry
loud
breathed His last
And
205627	the
205629	veil
205631	of the
temple
was torn
205635	into
two
205638	from
top
205641	to
bottom
Having seen
then
205646	the
centurion
-
standing
205651	from
205653	opposite of
Him
that
thus
He breathed His last
he said
Truly
205661	this
205663	-
man
205666	[the] Son
of God
was
There were
then
205672	also
205674	women
205676	from
afar off
looking on
205680	among
whom
also
Mary
205685	-
Magdalene
and
Mary

and
Salome
who
when
He was
205706	in
205708	-
Galilee
had been following
Him
and
had been ministering
to Him
and
205717	other
many
those
having come up with
Him
205723	to
Jerusalem
And
already
evening
having arrived
since
it was [the]
Preparation
that
is
the day before Sabbath
having come
Joseph
205738	-
205740	from
Arimathea
205743	a prominent
Council member
who
205747	also
himself
205750	was
waiting for
205753	the
205755	kingdom
205757	-
of God
having boldness
went in
205762	to
205764	-
Pilate
and
asked for
205769	the
205771	body
205773	-
of Jesus
205776	-
And
Pilate
wondered
if
already
He were dead
And
having called to [him]
205786	the
centurion
he questioned
him
whether
already
He had died
And
having known [it]
205796	from
205798	the
centurion
He granted
205802	the
body
205805	-
to Joseph
And
having bought
a linen cloth
having taken down
him
he wrapped [Him] in
205814	the
linen cloth
and
laid
Him
205820	in
a tomb
which
205824	was
cut
205827	out of
a rock
And
he rolled
a stone
205833	to
205835	the
205837	door
205839	of the
tomb
205842	-
And
Mary
205846	-
Magdalene
and
Mary
205851	the [mother]
of Joseph
were watching
where
He was laid
And
having passed
205859	the
Sabbath
Mary
205863	-
Magdalene
and
Mary
205868	the [mother]
205870	-
of James
and
Salome
bought
spices
that
having come
they might anoint
Him
And
205882	very
early
205885	on the
205887	first [day]
205889	of the
week
they come
205893	to
205895	the
tomb
having arisen
205899	the
sun
And
they were saying
205904	among
themselves
Who
will roll away
for us
205910	the
stone
205913	from
205915	the
205917	door
205919	of the
tomb
And
having looked up
they see
that
has been rolled away
205927	the
stone
it was
for
205932	large
extremely
And
having entered
205937	into
205939	the
tomb
they saw
a young man
sitting
205945	on
205947	the
right
clothed in
205951	a robe
white
and
they were greatly amazed
-
And
he says
to them
Not
be amazed
Jesus
you seek
205964	the
Nazarene
the [One]
having been crucified
He is risen
Not
He is
here
Behold
205974	the
place
where
they laid
Him
But
go
say
205983	the
205985	disciples
of Him
and
205989	-
to Peter
that
He goes before
you
205995	into
205997	-
Galilee
there
Him
will you see
as
He said
to you
And
having gone out
they fled
206009	from
206011	the
tomb
Had seized
for
them
trembling
and
amazement
and
to none
nothing
they spoke
they were afraid
for
Having risen
now
early [the]
206029	first [day]
of the week
He appeared
first
to Mary
206035	-
Magdalene
206038	from
whom
He had cast out
206042	seven
demons
She
having gone
told [it]
to those
206049	with
Him
having been
mourning
and
weeping
And they
having heard
that
He is alive
and
has been seen
206062	by
her
disbelieved
206066	After
now
these things
206070	to two
206072	of
them
as they are walking
He appeared
206077	in
206079	another
form
going
206083	into
[the] country
And they
having gone
told [it]
206089	to the
rest
neither
them
did they believe
Afterward
now
were reclining
206098	they
206100	to the
eleven
He appeared
and
rebuked
206106	the
206108	unbelief
of them
and
hardness of heart
because
those
having seen
Him
arisen
not
they believed
And
He said
to them
Having gone
206124	into
206127	the
world
all
proclaim
206132	the
gospel
206135	to all
206137	the
creation
The [one]
having believed
and
having been baptized
will be saved
the [one]
however
having disbelieved
will be condemned
206149	Signs
now
those
having believed
these
will accompany
206156	In
206158	the
206160	name
of Me
demons
they will cast out
206165	with tongues
they will speak
new
serpents
they will take up
and if
206172	deadly
anything
they drink
206176	no
not
them
shall it hurt
206181	upon
[the] sick
hands
they will lay
and
well
they will be
206189	-
Indeed
therefore
the Lord
Jesus
206195	after
-
speaking
to them
was taken up
206201	into
206203	the
heaven
and
sat
206208	at [the]
206210	right hand
206212	-
of God
They
now
having gone forth
preached
everywhere
206220	the
Lord
working with [them]
and
206225	the
word
confirming
206229	by
206231	the
206233	accompanying
signs
206236	



206241	
206243

206274	


206278	
206280	
206282	

Inasmuch as
many
have undertaken
to draw up
a narration
206290	concerning
206292	the
206294	having been accomplished
206296	among
us
things
as
delivered [them]
to us
those
206304	from
[the] beginning
eyewitnesses
and
servants
having been
206311	of the
word
it seemed good
also to me
having been acquainted
from the first
with all things
carefully
with method
to you
to write
206323	most excellent
Theophilus
so that
you may know
206329	concerning
which
you were instructed
[of the] things
206334	the
certainty
There was
206338	in
206340	the
206342	days
of Herod
206345	king
206347	-
of Judea
206351	a priest
certain
named
Zechariah
206356	of [the]
206358	division
of Abijah
and
wife
of him
206364	of
206366	the
206368	daughters
of Aaron
and
206372	the
206374	name
of her
Elizabeth
They were
now
righteous
both
206382	before
206384	-
God
walking
206388	in
206390	all
206392	the
206394	commandments
and
ordinances
206398	of the
Lord
blameless
And
no
there was
to them
child
inasmuch as
was
206409	-
Elizabeth
barren
and
both
206415	advanced
206417	in
206419	the
206421	years
of them
were
It came to pass
now
206427	in
the
fulfilling the priestly service
of him
206432	in
206434	the
206436	order
206438	of the
206440	division
of him
206443	before
206445	-
God
206448	according to
206450	the
206452	custom
206454	of the
priesthood
it fell to him by lot
-
to burn incense
having entered
206461	into
206463	the
206465	temple
206467	of the
Lord
And
206471	all
206473	the
206475	multitude
206477	were
206479	of the
people
praying
outside
206484	at the
206486	hour
206488	of the
incense
Appeared
then
to him
206494	an angel
of [the] Lord
standing
206498	at
206500	[the] right
206502	of the
206504	altar
206506	of the
incense
And
was troubled
Zechariah
having seen [him]
and
fear
fell
206516	upon
him
Said
then
206521	to
him
206524	the
angel
Not
fear
Zechariah
because
has been heard
206532	the
206534	prayer
of you
and
206538	the
206540	wife
of You
Elizabeth
will bear
a son
to you
and
you shall call
206549	the
206551	name
of him
John
And
he will be
joy
to you
and
gladness
and
many
206563	at
206565	the
206567	birth
of him
will rejoice
He will be
for
great
206574	before
Lord
and
wine
and
strong drink
206581	no
not
shall he drink
and
206586	[of the] Spirit
Holy
he will be filled
206590	even
206592	from
206594	[the] womb
206596	of [the] mother
of him
And
206600	many
206602	of the
206604	sons
of Israel
he will turn
206608	to
[the] Lord
206611	the
206613	God
of them
And
he
will go forth
206619	before
Him
206622	in
206624	[the] spirit
and
power
of Elijah
to turn
206630	[the] hearts
of [the] fathers
206633	to
[the] children
and
[the] disobedient
206638	to
206640	[the] wisdom
of [the] righteous
to make ready
for [the] Lord
206645	a people
prepared
And
said
Zechariah
206651	to
206653	the
angel
206656	By
what
will I know
this
I
for
am
an old man
and
206666	the
206668	wife
of me
is advanced
206672	in
206674	the
206676	years
of her
And
answering
206681	the
angel
said
to him
I
am
Gabriel
the [one]
standing
206691	before
206693	-
God
and
I was sent
to speak
206699	to
you
and
to bring glad tidings
to you
these
And
behold
you will be
silent
and
not
able
to speak
206714	until
206716	that
day
shall take place
these things
206721	in return for
that
not
you did believe
206726	the
206728	words
of me
which
will be fulfilled
206733	in
206735	the
206737	season
of them
And
206741	were
206743	the
people
expecting
206747	-
Zechariah
and
they were wondering
206752	at
the
delaying
206756	in
206758	the
temple
of him
Having come out
then
not
he was able
to speak
to them
and
they recognized
that
a vision
he had seen
206773	in
206775	the
temple
And
he
206780	was
making signs
to them
and
remained
mute
And
it came to pass
when
were fulfilled
206791	the
206793	days
206795	of the
206797	service
of him
he departed
206801	to
206803	the
206805	home
of him
206808	After
then
206811	these
206813	-
days
conceived
Elizabeth
206818	the
206820	wife
of him
and
hid
herself
206826	months
five
saying
-
Thus
to me
has done
the Lord
206835	in
[the] days

206847	In

Said
then
Mary
207017	to
207019	the

How

And

And
he came
208471	in
208473	the
Spirit
208476	into
208478	the
temple
and

Now
You dismiss

You have prepared
208556	before

208575	of [the] people
of You

And
208580	were
208582	the
208584	father

and
208588	the
mother
marveling
208592	at
the things
having been spoken
208596	concerning
Him
And
blessed
them
Simeon
and
said
208605	to
Mary
208608	the
208610	mother
of Him
Behold
this [Child]
is appointed
208616	for
208618	[the] falling
and
rising up
208622	of many
208624	in
208626	-
Israel
and
208630	for
208632	a sign
spoken against
208635	and
208638	of you
also
of her
208642	the
soul
will go through
a sword
so that
-
may be revealed
208650	of
208652	many
hearts
[the] thoughts
And
there was
208658	Anna
a prophetess
208661	daughter
of Phanuel
208664	of
208666	[the] tribe
of Asher
she
being advanced
208671	in
208673	years

having lived
208677	with
a husband
208680	years
seven
208683	from
208685	the
208687	marriage
of herself
and
she
[was] a widow
208693	of about
208695	years
208697	eighty [and]
four
who
not
departed
208703	the
temple
with fastings
and
prayers
serving
night
and
day
And
208714	she
208716	at that
hour
having come up
was giving praise
208721	-
to God
and
was speaking
208726	concerning
Him
208729	to all
those
waiting for
208733	[the] redemption
of Jerusalem
And
when
they had performed
208739	everything
208741	-
208743	according to
208745	the
208747	law
of [the] Lord
they returned
208751	to
208753	-
Galilee
208756	to the
208758	town
of them
Nazareth
208762	-
And
the Child
continued to grow
and
become strong
being filled
with wisdom
and
208772	[the] grace
of God
was
208776	upon
Him
And
were going
208781	the
208783	parents
of Him
208786	every
year
208789	to
Jerusalem
208792	at the
208794	feast
208796	of the
Passover
And
when
He was
208802	years [old]
twelve
having gone up
they
208807	according to
208809	the
208811	custom
208813	of the
Feast
and
having completed
208818	the
days
208821	in
the
returning
of them
remained behind
Jesus
208828	the
boy
208831	in
Jerusalem
But
not
knew
208837	the
208839	parents
of Him
Having supposed
now
Him
to be
208846	in
208848	their
company
they went
208852	a dayâs
journey
and
began seeking
Him
208858	among
208860	the
relatives
and
208864	the
acquaintances
and
not
having found [Him]
they returned
208871	to
Jerusalem
seeking
Him
And
it came to pass
208878	after
208880	days
three
they found
Him
208885	in
208887	the
temple
sitting
208891	in
208893	[the] midst
208895	of the
teachers
both
hearing
them
and
questioning
them
Were amazed
then
208906	all
those
hearing
Him
208911	at
208914	the
understanding
and
208918	the
answers
of Him
And
having seen
Him
they were astonished
and
said
208928	to
Him
208931	the
208933	mother
of Him
Child
why
have You done
to us
thus
Behold
208942	the
208944	father
of You
and I
distressing
were seeking
You
And
He said
208953	to
them
Why [is it]
that
you were seeking
Me
Not
knew you
that
208963	in
208965	the [house]
208967	of the
208969	Father
of Me
it behooves
to be
Me
And
they
not
understood
208979	the
word
that
He spoke
to them
And
He went down
208987	with
them
and
came
208992	to
Nazareth
and
208996	He was
subject
to them
And
209001	the
209003	mother
of Him
was treasuring up
209007	all
209009	the
matters
209012	in
209014	the
209016	heart
of her
And
Jesus
continued to advance
209022	in
209024	-
wisdom
and
stature
and
209030	in favor
209032	with
God
and
men
209037	In

then

209044	of the

of Tiberius

came
209090	[the] word
of God
209093	upon
John
209096	-
209098	of Zechariah
son
209101	in
209103	the
wilderness
And
he went
209108	into
209110	all
209112	the
209114	surrounding region
209116	of the
Jordan
proclaiming
209120	a baptism
209122	of repentance
209124	for
209126	forgiveness
of sins
as
it has been written
209131	in
209133	[the] book
209135	of [the] words
of Isaiah
209138	the
prophet
209141	[The] voice
of one crying
209144	in
209146	the
wilderness
Prepare
209150	the
209152	way
of [the] Lord
straight
make
209157	the
209159	paths
of Him
209162	Every
valley
will be filled
and
209167	every
mountain
and
hill
will be made low
and
will become
209175	the
crooked
209178	into
straight
and
209182	the
rough
209185	into
209187	ways
smooth
and
will see
209192	all
flesh
209195	the
209197	salvation
209199	-
of God
He was saying
therefore
209204	to the
209206	coming out
crowds
to be baptized
209210	by
him
209213	Offspring
of vipers
who
forewarned
you
to flee
209220	from
209222	the
209224	coming
wrath
Produce
therefore
209229	fruits
209231	worthy
209233	-
of repentance
and
not
begin
to say
209240	in
yourselves
[As] father
We have
209245	-
Abraham
I say
for
to you
that
is able
209253	-
God
209256	from
209259	-
stones
these
to raise up
children
209265	-
to Abraham
Already
now
209270	also
209272	the
ax
209275	to
209277	the
209279	root
209281	of the
trees
is applied
209285	every
therefore
209288	tree
not
producing
209292	fruit
good
is cut down
and
209297	into
[the] fire
is thrown
And
were asking
him
209304	the
crowds
saying
What
then
shall we do
Answering
now
he was saying
to them
The [one]
having
209317	two
tunics
let him impart
to the [one]
none
having
and
the [one]
having
food
likewise
let him do
Came
then
209332	also
tax collectors
to be baptized
and
they said
209338	to
him
Teacher
what
shall we do
-
And
he said
209347	to
them
209350	Nothing
more
209353	beyond
that
having been appointed
to you
collect
Were asking
then
him
209362	also
those being soldiers
saying
What
shall do
209368	also
we
And
he said
to them
No one
extort
nor
accuse falsely
and
be content with
209380	the
209382	wages
of you
Are expecting
then
209387	the
people
and
wondering
all
209393	in
209395	the
209397	hearts
of them
209400	concerning
209402	-
John
whether
ever
he
might be
209409	the
Christ
Answered
saying
[to] all
209415	-
John
I
indeed
with water
baptize
you
comes
however
209425	the [One]
209427	mightier
than I
of whom
not
I am
worthy
to untie
209435	the
209437	strap
209439	of the
209441	sandals
of Him
He
you
will baptize
209447	with
209449	[the] Spirit
Holy
and
with fire
209454	of whom
209456	the
winnowing fork [is]
209459	in
209461	the
209463	hand
of Him
to clear
209467	the
209469	threshing floor
of Him
and
to gather
209474	the
wheat
209477	into
209479	the
209481	barn
of Him
209484	-
But
the chaff
He will burn up
209489	with fire
unquenchable
Many
indeed
therefore
other
things
exhorting
he was preaching the good news to
209499	the
people
209502	-
And
Herod
209506	the
tetrarch
being reproved
209510	by
him
209513	concerning
Herodias
209516	the
209518	wife
209520	of the
209522	brother
of him
and
209526	concerning
all
that
had done
[the] evils
209532	-
Herod
added
209536	yet
this
209539	to
all
he locked up
209543	-
John
209546	in
prison
It came to pass
now
209551	in
-
having been baptized
209555	all
209557	the
people
209560	and
Jesus
having been baptized
and
having prayed
was opened
209567	the
heaven
and
descended
209572	the
209574	Spirit
209576	-
Holy
209579	in a bodily
form
209582	as
a dove
209585	upon
Him
and
a voice
209590	out of
heaven
came

209858	of [the] Spirit
Holy
returned
209862	from
209864	the
Jordan
and
was led
209869	by
209871	the
Spirit
209874	into
209876	the
wilderness
209879	days
forty
being tempted
209883	by
209885	the
devil
And
not
He ate
nothing
209892	in
209895	the
days
those
and
having ended
they
He was hungry
Said
then
to Him
209906	the
devil
If
209910	[the] Son
You are
209913	-
of God
speak
209918	to the
stone
this
that
it should become
bread
And
answered
209927	to
him
209930	-
Jesus
It has been written
-
Not
209936	on
209938	bread
alone
shall live
209942	the
man
And
having led up
Him
he showed
Him
209950	all
209952	the
209954	kingdoms
209956	of the
world
209959	in
209961	a moment
of time
And
said
to Him
209967	the
devil
To You
will I give
209974	the
authority
this
all
and
209980	the
209982	glory
of it
for
to me
it has been delivered
and
to whom
if
I wish
I give
it
You
therefore
if
You will worship
209998	before
me
will be
Yours
all
And
answering
210006	-
Jesus
said
to him
It has been written
You shall worship
[the] Lord
210014	-
210016	God
of You
and
210020	Him
only
you shall serve
He led
also
Him
210027	to
Jerusalem
and
set
210032	upon
210034	the
210036	pinnacle
210038	of the
temple
and
said
to Him
If
210045	[the] Son
You are
210048	-
of God
cast
Yourself
from here
down
It has been written
for
-
210058	To the
210060	angels
of Him
He will give orders
210064	concerning
You
-
to guard
You
and
-
210072	in
[their] hands
will they bear
You
lest
ever
You strike
210080	against
a stone
210083	the
210085	foot
of You
And
answering
said
to him
210092	-
Jesus
-
It has been said
Not
you shall test
[the] Lord
210100	the
210102	God
of you
And
having finished
210107	every
temptation
210110	the
devil
departed
210114	from
Him
210117	until
an opportune time
And
returned
210122	-
Jesus
210125	in
210127	the
210129	power
210131	of the
Spirit
210134	to
210136	-
Galilee
and
a report
went out
210142	into
210144	all
210146	the
surrounding region
210149	concerning
Him
And
He
was teaching
210155	in
210157	the
210159	synagogues
of them
being glorified
210163	by
all
And
He came
210168	to
Nazareth
where
210172	He had been
brought up
and
He entered
210177	according to
the
custom
to Him
210182	on
210184	the
210186	day
210188	of the
Sabbaths
210191	into
210193	the
synagogue
and
stood up
to read
And
there was given
to Him
210202	[the] scroll of
210204	the
prophet
Isaiah
and
having unrolled
210210	the
scroll
He found
210214	the
place
where
210218	it was
written
210221	[The] Spirit
of [the] Lord [is]
210224	upon
Me
210227	of which
because
He has anointed
Me
to preach good news
to [the] poor
He has sent
Me
to proclaim
to [the] captives
deliverance
and
to [the] blind
recovery of sight
to send forth
[the] oppressed
210244	in
deliverance
to proclaim
210249	[the] year
of [the] Lordâs
favor
And
having rolled up
210255	the
scroll
having delivered [it]
210259	to the
attendant
He sat down
and
210265	of all
210267	the
eyes
210270	in
210272	the
synagogue
210275	were
fixed upon
Him
He began
then
to say
210282	to
them
-
Today
is fulfilled
210289	the
Scripture
this
210293	in
210295	the
210297	hearing
of you
And
all
were bearing witness
to Him
and
marveling
210306	at
210308	the
210310	words
210312	of the
grace
that
are proceeding
210317	out of
210319	the
210321	mouth
of Him
and
they were saying
Not
210327	the son
is
of Joseph
this
And
He said
210334	to
them
Surely
you will say
to Me
210341	the
proverb
this
Physician
heal
yourself
Whatsoever
we have heard
has been done
210351	in
210353	-
Capernaum
do
210357	also
here
210360	in
210362	the
210364	hometown
of You
He said
then
Truly
I say
to you
that
210373	no
prophet
acceptable
is
210378	in
210380	the
210382	hometown
of him
210385	In
truth
now
I say
to you
210391	many
widows
there were
210395	in
210397	the
210399	days
of Elijah
210402	in
210404	-
Israel
when
was shut up
210409	the
heaven
210412	for
210414	years
three
and
210418	months
six
when
there was
210423	a famine
great
210426	upon
210428	all
210430	the
land
and
210434	to
210436	none
of them
was sent
Elijah
if
not
210443	to
210445	Zarephath
210447	-
of Sidon
210450	to
a woman
a widow
And
210455	many
lepers
were
210459	in
210461	-
Israel
210464	in the time
of Elisha
210467	the
prophet
and
210471	none
of them
was cleansed
if
not
Naaman
210478	the
Syrian
And
were filled
210483	all
with anger
210486	in
210488	the
synagogue
hearing
these things
and
having risen up
they cast
Him
210497	out
210499	of [the]
city
and
led
Him
210505	unto
210507	brow
210509	of the
hill
210512	upon
which
210515	the
210517	town
had been built
of them
in order
to throw over
him
He
however
having passed
210527	through
210529	[the] midst
of them
went away
And
He went down
210535	to
Capernaum
210538	a city
210540	-
of Galilee
And
210544	He was
teaching
them
210548	on
210550	the
Sabbaths
and
they were astonished
210555	at
210557	the
210559	teaching
of Him
for
210563	with
authority
was
210567	the
210569	message
of Him
And
210573	in
210575	the
synagogue
was
210579	a man
having
210582	a spirit
210584	of a demon
unclean
and
he cried out
210589	in a voice
loud
Ha
What
to us
and
to You
Jesus
of Nazareth
Are You come
to destroy
us
I know
You
who
are
210606	the
210608	Holy [One]
210610	-
of God
And
rebuked
him
210616	-
Jesus
saying
Be silent
and
come forth
210623	out of
him
And
having thrown
him
210629	the
demon
210632	into
210634	the
midst
it came out
210638	from
him
in nothing
having hurt
him
And
came
astonishment
210647	upon
all
and
they were speaking
210652	to
one another
saying
What
210658	-
word
[is] this
that
210663	with
authority
and
power
He commands
210669	the
210671	unclean
spirits
and
they come out
And
was spreading
210678	the report
210680	concerning
Him
210683	into
210685	every
210687	place
210689	of the
surrounding region
Having risen up
then
210694	out of
210696	the
synagogue
He entered
210700	into
210702	the
210704	house
of Simon
210707	[The] mother-in-law
then
210710	-
of Simon
210713	was
oppressed with
210716	a fever
great
and
they appealed
to Him
210722	for
her
And
having stood
210727	over
her
He rebuked
210731	the
fever
and
it left
her
immediately
then
having arisen
she began to serve
them
At the setting
now
210744	of the
sun
210747	all
as many as
had [any]
ailing
210752	with diseases
various
brought
them
210757	to
Him
-
and
210763	on one
each
of them
210767	the
hands
having laid
He would heal
them
Were going out
now
210775	also
demons
210778	from
many
crying out
and
saying
-
You
are
210787	the
210789	Son
210791	-
of God
And
rebuking [them]
not
did He allow
them
to speak
because
they knew
210802	the
Christ
Him
to be
Having arrived
now
daybreak
having gone out
He went
210812	into
210814	a solitary
place
and
210818	the
crowds
were seeking
Him
and
they came
210825	up to
Him
and
were detaining
Him
of the
not
to go
210834	from
them
-
But
He said
210840	to
them
-
210844	Also
210846	to the
210848	other
towns
to preach [the] good news
Me
it behooves
210854	of the
210856	kingdom
210858	-
of God
because
210862	for
this
have I been sent forth
And
210867	He was
preaching
210870	in
210872	the
210874	synagogues
210876	-
of Judea
It came to pass
then
210881	in
-
210884	the
crowd
pressing on
Him
also
to hear
210891	the
210893	word
210895	of
God
and
He
210900	was
standing
210903	by
210905	the
210907	lake
of Gennesaret
and
He saw
210912	boats
two
lying
210916	by
210918	the
lake
210921	-
but
the fishermen
210925	from
them
having gone out
were washing
210930	the
nets
Having entered
then
210935	into
210937	one
210939	of the
boats
which
was
Simonâs
He asked
him
210947	from
210949	the
land
to put off
a little
Having sat down
then
210956	from
210958	the
boat
He was teaching
210962	the
crowds
When
then
He left off
speaking
He said
210970	to
210972	-
Simon
Put off
210976	into
210978	the
deep
and
let down
210983	the
210985	nets
of you
210988	for
a catch
And
answering
Simon
said
Master
210996	through
210998	whole
night
having toiled
nothing
have we taken
211004	at
however
211007	the
211009	word
of You
I will let down
211013	the
nets
And
this
having done
they enclosed
211021	a multitude
of fishes
great
were breaking
now
211027	the
211029	nets
of them
And
they beckoned
211034	to the
211036	partners
211038	in
211040	the
211042	other
boat
-
having come
to help
them
and
they came
and
filled
211053	both
211055	the
boats
so that
were sinking
they
Having seen
now
Simon
Peter
fell at
211066	the
211068	knees
of Jesus
saying
Depart
211073	from
me
for
211077	a man
sinful
am I
Lord
Amazement
for
laid hold
on him
and
211087	on all
211089	those
211091	with
him
211094	at
211096	the
211098	catch
211100	of the
fish
which
they had taken
likewise
now
211107	also
James
and
John
211112	[the] sons
of Zebedee
who
were
partners
211118	-
with Simon
And
said
211123	to
211125	-
Simon
211128	-
Jesus
Not
fear
211133	from
211135	-
now on
men
211139	you will be
catching
And
having brought
211144	the
boats
211147	to
211149	the
land
having left
all
they followed
Him
And
it came to pass
211158	in
-
being
His
211163	in
211165	one
211167	of the
cities
that
behold
211172	a man
211174	full
of leprosy
having seen
then
211179	-
Jesus
having fallen
211183	upon
[his] face
begged
Him
saying
Lord
if
You would be willing
You are able
me
to cleanse
And
having stretched out
211197	the
hand
He touched
him
saying
I am willing
be you cleansed
And
immediately
211207	the
leprosy
departed
211211	from
him
And
He
ordered
him
no one
to tell
But
having gone
show
yourself
211224	to the
priest
and
offer
211229	for
211231	the
211233	cleansing
of you
as
commanded
Moses
211239	for
211241	a testimony
to them
Was spread abroad
now
still more
211247	the
211249	report
211251	concerning
Him
and
were coming
211256	crowds
great
to hear
and
to be healed
211262	from
211264	the
211266	sicknesses
of them
He Himself
now
211271	was
withdrawing
211274	into
211276	the
wilderness
and
praying
And
it came to pass
211283	on
211285	one
211287	of the
days
that
He
211292	was
teaching
and
211296	there were
sitting by
Pharisees
and
teachers of the law
who
211303	were
come
211306	out of
211308	every
211310	village
211312	-
of Galilee
and
of Judea
and
of Jerusalem
And
211320	[the] power
of [the] Lord
was [there]
211324	for
-
to heal
Him
And
behold
men
carrying
211333	upon
a mat
a man
who
211338	was
paralyzed
and
they were seeking
him
to bring in
and
to place
211347	before
Him
And
not
having found
what way
they should bring in
him
211356	on account of
211358	the
crowd
having gone up
211362	on
211364	the
housetop
211367	through
211369	the
tiles
they let down
him
211374	with
211376	the
mat
211379	into
211381	the
midst
211384	before
211386	-
Jesus
And
having seen
211391	the
211393	faith
of them
He said
Man
have been forgiven
you
211400	the
211402	sins
of you
And
began
to reason
211408	the
scribes
and
211412	the
Pharisees
saying
Who
is
this
who
speaks
blasphemies
Who
is able
sins
to forgive
if
not
211428	alone
211430	-
God
Having known
now
211435	-
Jesus
211438	the
211440	reasonings
of them
answering
He said
211445	to
them
Why
reason you
211450	in
211452	the
211454	hearts
of you
Which
is
easier
to say
Have been forgiven
you
211463	the
211465	sins
of you
or
to say
Arise
and
walk
That
however
you may know
that
211477	the
211479	Son
211481	-
of Man
authority
has
211486	on
211488	the
earth
to forgive
sins
He said
to the [one]
having been paralyzed
To you
I say
arise
and
having taken up
211501	the
211503	mat
of you
go
211507	to
211509	the
211511	house
of you
And
immediately
having stood up
211517	before
them
having taken up
211521	[that] on
which
he was lying
he departed
211526	to
211528	the
211530	home
of him
glorifying
211534	-
God
And
amazement
seized
all
and
they were glorifying
211543	-
God
and
were filled
with fear
saying
-
We have seen
remarkable things
today
And
211555	after
these things
He went forth
and
He saw
211561	a tax collector
named
Levi
sitting
211566	at
211568	the
tax booth
and
He said
to him
Follow
Me
And
having left
all
having arisen
he began to follow
Him
And
made
211584	a banquet
great
Levi
for Him
211589	in
211591	the
211593	house
of him
and
there was
211599	a multitude
great
of tax collectors
and
others
who
211606	were
211608	with
them
reclining
And
were grumbling
211614	the
Pharisees
and
211618	the
211620	scribes
of them
211623	at
211625	the
211627	disciples
of Him
saying
211631	Because of
why
211634	with
211636	the
tax collectors
and
sinners
do you eat
and
drink
And
answering
211646	-
Jesus
said
211650	to
them
No
211654	need
have
those
being well
of a physician
but
those
sick
being
Not
I have come
to call
righteous [ones]
but
sinners
211670	to
repentance
-
And
they said
211676	to
Him
211679	The
211681	disciples
of John
fast
often
and
prayers
make
likewise
211690	also
211692	those
211694	of the
Pharisees
211697	those
however
of You
eat
and
drink
211704	-
And
Jesus
said
211709	to
them
Not
are you able
211714	the
211716	sons
211718	of the
bridechamber
211721	in
which [time]
211724	the
bridegroom
211727	with
them
is
to make
to fast
Will come
however
days
also
when
shall be taken away
211739	from
them
211742	the
bridegroom
then
they will fast
211747	in
211749	those
211751	-
days
He was speaking
now
211756	also
a parable
211759	to
them
-
No one
a piece
211765	of
211767	a garment
new
having torn
puts [it]
211772	on
211774	a garment
old
if
however
otherwise
also
211781	the
new
he will tear
and
211786	the
old
not
will match
211791	which [is]
[the] piece
211794	-
211796	of
211798	the
new
And
no one
puts
211804	wine
new
211807	into
211809	wineskins
old
if
now
otherwise
will burst
211816	the
211818	wine
211820	-
new
211823	the
wineskins
and
it
will be spilled out
and
211830	the
wineskins
will be destroyed
But
211835	wine
new
211838	into
211840	wineskins
fresh
must be put
And
no one
having drunk
old [wine]
desires
new
he says
for
211852	The
old
better
is
It came to pass
then
211859	on
a Sabbath
is passing along
He
211864	through
grainfields
and
were plucking
211869	the
211871	disciples
of Him
and
were eating
211876	the
heads of grain
rubbing [them]
211880	in the
hands
211883	Some
however
211886	of the
Pharisees
said
Why
do you
that which
not
it is lawful
211895	[on] the
Sabbaths
And
answering
211900	to
them
said
211904	-
Jesus
Not even
this
have you read
that which
did
David
when
was hungry
he himself
and
those who
211918	with
him
were
how
he entered
211924	into
211926	the
211928	house
211930	-
of God
and
211934	the
211936	loaves
211938	of the
presentation
having taken
ate
and
gave
211945	to those
211947	with
him
which
not
it is lawful
to eat
if
not
211956	only
211958	to the
priests
And
He was saying
to them
211964	Lord
is
211967	of the
Sabbath
211970	the
211972	Son
211974	-
of Man
It came to pass
then
211979	on
211981	another
Sabbath
entered
He
211986	into
211988	the
synagogue
and
taught
and
there was
a man
there
and
211998	the
212001	hand
of him
212004	the
right
was
withered
Were closely watching
now
Him
212012	the
scribes
and
212016	the
Pharisees
whether
212020	on
212022	the
Sabbath
He will heal
that
they might find [reason]
to accuse
Him
He
now
knew
212033	the
212035	thoughts
of them
He said
now
212040	to the
man
the
withered
having
212046	the
hand
Arise
and
stand
212052	in
212054	the
midst
And
having risen up
he stood
Said
then
212062	-
Jesus
212065	to
them
I ask
you
whether
it is lawful
212072	on the
Sabbath
to do good
or
to do evil
Life
to save
or
to destroy
And
having looked around
212084	all
on them
He said
to him
Stretch out
212090	the
212092	hand
of you
-
And
he did
and
was restored
212100	the
212102	hand
of him
They themselves
then
were filled
with rage
and
were discussing
212111	with
one another
what
-
they might do
212117	-
to Jesus
It came to pass
then
212122	in
212125	the
days
those
went out
He
212131	to
212133	the
mountain
to pray
and
212138	He was
spending the night
212141	in
212143	-
212145	prayer
212147	-
to God
And
when
it became
day
He called to [Him]
212155	the
212157	disciples
of Him
also
having chosen out
212162	from
them
twelve
whom
212167	also
apostles
He named
Simon
whom
also
He named
Peter
and
Andrew
212178	the
212180	brother
of him
and
James
and
John
and
Philip
and
Bartholomew
and
Matthew
and
Thomas
and
212196	James
[son of] Alphaeus
and
Simon
the [one]
called
Zealot
and
212205	Judas [son]
of James
and
Judas
Iscariot
who
became
[the] betrayer
And
having descended
212216	with
them
He stood
212220	on
212222	a place
level
and
212227	a crowd
large
212230	of disciples
of Him
and
212235	a multitude
great
212238	of the
212240	people
212242	from
212244	all
212246	-
Judea
and
Jerusalem
and
212252	the
212254	sea coast
of Tyre
and
Sidon
who
came
to hear
Him
and
to be healed
212265	of
212267	the
212269	diseases
of them
And
those
troubled
212275	with
212277	spirits
unclean
were healed
And
212282	all
212284	the
multitude
were seeking
to touch
Him
because
power
212292	from
Him
was going out
and
healing
all
And
He
having lifted up
212302	the
212304	gaze
of Him
212307	upon
212309	the
212311	disciples
of Him
was saying
Blessed [are]
212316	the
poor
for
yours
is
212322	the
212324	kingdom
212326	-
of God
Blessed [are]
those
hungering
now
for
you will be filled
Blessed [are]
those
weeping
now
for
you will laugh
Blessed
are you
when
shall hate
you
212346	-
men
and
when
they shall exclude
you
and
shall insult [you]
and
shall cast out
212357	the
212359	name
of you
as
evil
212364	on account of
212366	the
212368	Son
212370	-
of Man
Rejoice
212374	in
212376	that
212378	-
day
and
leap for joy
behold
for
212385	the
212387	reward
of you
[is] great
212391	in
212393	-
heaven
212396	According to
212398	these things
of them

212403	the
prophets
212406	the
212408	fathers
likewise
But
woe
to you
212414	who are
rich
for
you are receiving
212419	the
212421	comfort
of you
Woe
to you
who
having been filled
now
for
you will hunger
Woe to
those
laughing
now
for
you will mourn
and
will weep
Woe to you
when
well
of you
speak
212444	all
212446	-
men
212449	according to
212451	these things
of them
for
used to treat
212456	the
false prophets
212459	the
212461	fathers
likewise
But
to you
I say
to those

Love

212485	for
those

To the [one]

And
as
you desire
that
should do
to you
212542	-
men
do
to them
likewise
And
if
you love
those
loving
you
212554	what
to you
credit
is it
212559	Even
for
212562	-
sinners
those
loving
them

And
for
if
you do good
to those

you
212576	what

And
if
you lend [to those]
212593	from
whom
you expect
to receive back
212598	what
to you
credit
is it
212603	Even
sinners
to sinners

that
they might receive
212610	the
same amount
But
love
212615	the
212617	enemies
of you
and
do good
and
lend
nothing
expecting in return
and
will be
212628	the
212630	reward
of you
great
and
you will be
212636	sons of
the Most High
for
He
kind
is
212643	to
212645	the
ungrateful
and
evil
Be you
merciful
as
212653	the
212655	Father
of you
merciful
is
And
not
judge
that
212664	no
not
you should be judged
and
not
condemn
that
212672	no
not
you should be condemned
Forgive
and
you will be forgiven
Give
and
it will be given
to you
212684	Measure
good
pressed down
shaken together
running over
will they put
212691	into
212693	the
212695	lap
of you
212698	with that
for
measure
you measure
it will be measured again
to you
He spoke
then
212707	also
a parable
to them
Not
is able
a blind [man]
a blind [man]
to lead
Not
both
212718	into
a pit
will fall
Not
is
a disciple
212725	above
212727	the
teacher
212730	fully trained
however
everyone
will be
212735	like
212737	the
212739	teacher
of him
Why
now
look you at
212745	the
splinter
212748	that [is]
212750	in
212752	the
212754	eye
212756	of the
212758	brother
of you
212761	-
and
the beam
212765	that [is]
212767	in
212769	the
212771	own
eye
not
notice
How
are you able
to say
212779	to
212781	brother
of you
Brother
let [that]
I might cast out
212787	the
splinter
212790	that [is]
212792	in
212794	the
212796	eye
of you

Hypocrite
cast out
first
212816	the
beam
212819	from
212821	the
212823	eye
of you
and
then
you will see clearly
212829	the
splinter
212832	-
212834	in
212836	the
212838	eye
212840	of the
212842	brother
of you
to cast out
No

212850	tree
good
producing
212854	fruit
bad
nor
again
212859	a tree

212891	The
212893	good
man
212896	out of
212898	the
212900	good
212902	treasure
212904	of the
heart
brings forth
212908	that which [is]
good
and
212912	the
evil
212915	out of
212917	the
evil
brings forth
212921	that which [is]

for
212927	the abundance
of his heart
speaks

of him
Why
now

do you call
Lord
Lord

what
I say
212947	Everyone
who
is coming

Me
and
hearing
212956	of Me
212958	the
words

doing
them
I will show
you
whom
he is

Like
he is
212971	to a man
building
a house
who
dug
and
deepened
and
laid
a foundation
212982	on
212984	the
rock
a flood
then
having come
burst upon
212991	the
stream
212995	the
house
that
and
not
was able
to shake
it
213004	because
-
well
had been built
it
The [one]
however
having heard
and
not
having done
like
is
213018	to a man
having built
a house
213022	on
213024	the
ground
213027	without
a foundation
on which
burst
213032	the
stream
and
immediately
it fell
and
was
213040	the
213042	ruin
213045	of the
house
that
great
And when
He had completed
213052	all
213054	the
213056	words
of Him
213059	in
213061	the
213063	hearing
213065	of the
people
He entered
213069	into
Capernaum
213073	Of a centurion
then
a certain
servant
sick
being
was about
to die
who
was
to him
valued highly
Having heard
then
213088	about
213090	-
Jesus
he sent
213094	to
Him
213097	elders
213099	of the
Jews
begging
Him
that
having come
He might save
213107	the
213109	servant
of him
-
And
having come
213115	to
213117	-
Jesus
they were begging
Him
earnestly
saying
that
Worthy
he is
to whom
You will grant
this
he loves
for
213132	the
213134	nation
of us
and
213138	the
synagogue
he
built
for us
213144	-
And
Jesus
was going
213149	with
them
Already
then
He
213155	not
far
being distant
213159	from
213161	the
house
sent
friends
213166	the
centurion
saying
to Him
Lord
not
trouble Yourself
not
for
worthy
I am
that
213179	under
213181	the
213183	roof
of me
You should come
therefore
neither
myself
counted I worthy
213191	to
You
to come
but
say
in a word
and
shall be healed
213200	the
213202	servant
of me
213205	Also
for
I
213209	a man
am
213212	under
authority
appointed
having
213217	under
me
soldiers
and
I say
to this [one]
Go
and
he goes
and
to another
Come
and
he comes
and
213233	to
213235	[the] servant
of me
Do
this
and
he does [it]
Having heard
then
these things
213245	-
Jesus
marveled at
him
and
having turned
213252	to the
213254	following
Him
crowd
He said
I say
to you
not even
213262	in
213264	-
Israel
213267	such great
faith
did I find
And
having returned
213273	to
213275	the
house
those
having been sent
found
213281	the
servant
in good health
And
it came to pass
213287	on
213289	the
next [day]
He went
213293	into
213295	a town
called
Nain
and
were going with
Him
213302	the
213304	disciples
of Him
and
213308	a crowd
great
As
then
He drew near
213314	to the
213316	gate
213318	of the
town
also
behold
was being carried out
213324	[one] having died
213326	only begotten
213328	son
213330	of the
213332	mother
of him
and
she
was
a widow
And
213341	a crowd
213343	of the
town
considerable
was
213348	with
her
And
having seen
her
213354	the
Lord
was moved with compassion
213358	on
her
and
said
to her
Not
weep
And
having come up
He touched
213369	the
bier
those
then
bearing [it]
stopped
And
He said
Young man
to you
I say
Arise
And
sat up
213384	the
dead [man]
and
began
to speak
and
He gave
him
213393	to the
213395	mother
of him
Seized
then
fear
all
and
they began glorifying
213404	-
God
saying
-
213409	A prophet
great
has risen up
213413	among
us
and
-
Has visited
213419	-
God
213422	the
213424	people
of Him
And
went out
213431	the
report
this
213435	in
213437	all
213439	-
Judea
213442	concerning
Him
and
213446	in all
213448	the
surrounding region
And
brought word
to John
213454	the
213456	disciples
of him
213459	concerning
213461	all
these things
And
having called near
213467	two
certain
213470	-
213472	disciples
of him
213475	-
John
sent [them]
213479	to
213481	the
Lord
saying
You
are
the
coming [One]
or
another
are we to look for
Having come
then
213494	to
Him
213497	the
men
said
John
213502	the
Baptist
has sent
us
213507	to
you
saying
You
are
the
coming [One]
or
another
are we to look for
213518	At
213520	that very
213522	-
hour
He healed
many
213527	of
diseases
and
afflictions
and
213533	spirits
evil
and
213537	to blind
many
He granted
to see
And
answering
He said
to them
Having gone
relate
to John
what
you have seen
and
heard
Blind
receive sight
lame
walk
lepers
are cleansed
and
deaf
hear
dead
are raised
poor
are gospelized
And
blessed
is
who
if
not
shall be offended
213573	in
Me
Having departed
then
213578	the
213580	messengers
of John
He began
to speak
213585	to
213587	the
crowds
213590	concerning
John
What
have you gone out
213595	into
213597	the
wilderness
to see
213601	A reed
213603	by
[the] wind
shaken
But
what
have you gone out
to see
213611	A man
213613	in
213615	fine
clothing
arrayed
Behold
213620	those
213622	in
213624	clothing
splendid
and
in luxury
living
213630	in
213632	the
palaces
are
But
what
have you gone out
to see
A prophet
Yes
I say
to you
and [one]
213645	more excellent
than a prophet
This
is he
213650	concerning
whom
it has been written
Behold
I send
213656	the
213658	messenger
of Me
213661	before
213663	[the] face
of you
who
will prepare
213668	the
213670	way
of You
213673	before
You
I say
to you
a greater
213679	among
213681	[those] born
of women
than John
no one
is
213687	-
yet
213690	the least
213692	in
213694	the
213696	kingdom
213698	of
God
greater
than he
is
And
213705	all
213707	the
people
having heard
even
213712	the
tax collectors
declared as righteous
213716	-
God
having been baptized [with]
213720	the
213722	baptism
of John
213725	-
but
the Pharisees
and
213730	the
lawyers
213733	the
213735	counsel
213737	-
of God
rejected
213741	as to
themselves
not
having been baptized
213746	by
him
To what
therefore
will I liken
213752	the
213754	men
213757	of the
generation
this
And
to what
are they
like
Like
are they
to little children
-
213769	in
the marketplace
sitting
and
calling
to each other
one
saying
We piped
to you
and
not
you did dance
we sang a dirge
and
not
you did weep
Has come
for
John
213790	the
Baptist
neither
eating
bread
nor
drinking
wine
and
you say
A demon
He has
Has come
213804	the
213806	Son
213808	-
of Man
eating
and
drinking
and
you say
Behold
a man
a glutton
and
a drunkard
213821	a friend
of tax collectors
and
of sinners
And
was justified
213828	-
wisdom
213831	by
213833	all
213835	the
213837	children
of her
Was asking
now
213842	one
Him
213845	of the
Pharisees
that
He should eat
213850	with
him
and
having entered
213855	into
213857	the
213859	house
213861	of the
Pharisee
He reclined
And
behold
a woman
who
was
213870	in
213872	the
city
a sinner
And
she having known
that
He had reclined
213880	in
213882	the
213884	house
213886	of the
Pharisee
having taken
213890	an alabaster flask
of fragrant oil
and
having stood
behind Him
213896	at
213898	the
213900	feet
of Him
weeping
213904	the
tears
she began
to wet
213909	with the
213911	feet
of Him
and
213915	with the
213917	hairs
213919	of the
213921	head
of her
she was wiping [them]
and
was kissing
213927	the
213929	feet
of Him
and
was anointing [them]
213934	with the
fragrant oil
Having seen
now
213939	the
Pharisee
the [one]
having invited
Him
he spoke
213946	within
himself
saying
This
if
He were
a prophet
would have known
-
who
and
what
213959	the
woman [is]
who
touches
Him
for
a sinner
she is
And
answering
213970	-
Jesus
said
213974	to
him
Simon
I have
to you
something
to say
-
And
Teacher
say [it]
he says
213987	Two
debtors
there were
213991	to a creditor
certain
213994	the
one
owed
213998	denarii
five hundred
214001	-
and
the other
fifty
Nothing
having
they
to pay
both
he forgave
214012	Which
therefore
of them
more
will love
him
Answering
Simon
said
I take it
that
[he] to whom
214025	the
most
he forgave
-
And
He said
to him
Rightly
You have judged
And
having turned
214037	to
214039	the
woman
214042	-
to Simon
He was saying
See you
214047	this
214049	the
woman
I entered
214054	of you
into
214057	the
house
water
of Me
214062	for
feet
not
you gave
with her
however
214069	-
tears
she wet
214073	My
214075	-
feet
and
214079	with
214081	[the] hair
of her
wiped [them]
A kiss
to Me
not
you gave
she herself
however
214091	from
which [time]
I came in
not
has ceased
kissing
214098	My
214100	-
feet
With oil
214104	the
214106	head
of Me
not
you did anoint
she herself
however
with fragrant oil
anointed
214115	the
214117	feet
of Me
214120	This
therefore
I say
to you
have been forgiven
214126	the
214129	sins
of her
214132	-
many
for
she loved
much
to whom
however
little
is forgiven
little
he loves
He said
then
to her
Have been forgiven
214148	your
214150	-
sins
And
began
those
reclining
to say
214158	within
themselves
Who
this
is
who
214165	even
sins
forgives
He said
then
214171	to
214173	the
woman
214176	The
214178	faith
of You
has saved
you
go
214184	in
peace
And
it came to pass
214189	afterward
214191	-
soon
that
He
was traveling
214197	throughout
city
and
village
preaching
and
proclaiming the good news
214205	of the
214207	kingdom
214209	-
of God
And
214213	the
Twelve
214216	[were] with
Him
and
214220	women
certain
who
214224	had been
cured
214227	from
214229	spirits
evil
and
infirmities
Mary
who
is called
Magdalene
214238	from
whom
214241	demons
seven
had gone out
and
Joanna
214247	wife
of Chuza
214250	a steward
of Herod
and
Susanna
and
214256	others
many
who
were ministering
to them
214262	out of
the
means
their own
[As] is assembling
now
214269	a crowd
great
and
214273	those
214275	from each
town
are coming
214279	to
Him
He spoke
214283	by
a parable
Went out
the [one]
sowing
-
to sow
214291	the
214293	seed
of him
And
214297	in
the
sowing
of him
some
indeed
fell
214305	along
214307	the
road
and
it was trampled upon
and
214313	the
214315	birds
214317	of the
air
devoured
it
And
other
fell
214325	upon
214327	the
rock
and
having sprung up
it withered
214333	through
-
no
having
moisture
And
other
fell
214342	in
214344	[the] midst
214346	of the
thorns
and
having sprung up with [it]
214351	the
thorns
choked
it
And
other
fell
214359	upon
214361	the
214363	soil
214365	-
good
and
having sprung up
it produced
214371	fruit
a hundredfold
These things
saying
He was calling out
The [one]
having
ears
to hear
let him hear
Were asking
then
Him
214385	the
214387	disciples
of Him
What
214391	this
means
214394	the
parable
-
And
He said
To you
it has been given
to know
214403	the
214405	mysteries
214407	of the
214409	kingdom
214411	-
of God
214414	to
however
[the] rest
214418	[it is] in
parables
so that
Seeing
not
may they see
and
hearing
not
may they understand
Is
now
this
214432	the
parable
214435	The
seed
is
214439	the
214441	word
214443	-
of God
214446	Those
now
214449	along
214451	the
road
are
those
having heard
then
comes
214459	the
devil
and
takes away
214464	the
word
214467	from
214469	the
214471	heart
of them
that
not
having believed
they should be saved
214478	Those
now
214481	upon
214483	the
rock
those who
when
they hear
214489	with
joy
receive
214493	the
word
and
these
a root
not
have
who
214502	for
a time
believe
and
214507	in
214509	time
of testing
fall away
That
now
214515	into
214517	the
thorns
having fallen
these
are
those
having heard
and
214526	under
cares
and
riches
and
214532	pleasures
214534	-
of life
moving along
are choked
and
not
do mature
214542	That
now
214545	in
214547	the
214549	good
soil
these
are
those
214555	in
214557	a heart
worthy
and
good
having heard
214563	the
word
keep [it]
and
bring forth fruit
214569	by
perseverance
No one
now
a lamp
having lighted
covers
it
with a vessel
or
214580	under
a bed
puts [it]
but
214585	on
a lampstand
puts [it]
so that
those
entering in
may see
214593	the
light
Nothing
for
is
hidden
which
not
manifest
will become
nor
secret
which
214607	nothing
not
shall be known
and
214612	to
light
come
Take heed
therefore
how
you hear
whoever
-
for
might have
will be given
to him
and
whoever
-
not
might have
214631	even
what
he seems
to have
will be taken away
214637	from
him
Came
then
214642	to
Him
214645	the
mother
and
214649	the
214651	brothers
of Him
and
not
they were able
to get
to Him
214659	because of
214661	the
crowd
It was told
also
Him
214667	The
214669	mother
of You
and
214673	the
214675	brothers
of You
are standing
outside
to see
wanting
You
-
But
answering
He said
214687	to
them
214690	Mother
of Me
and
214694	brothers
of me
those
are
who
214700	the
214702	word
214704	-
of God
are hearing
and
doing
It came to pass
then
214712	on
214714	one
214716	of the
days
also
He
entered
214722	into
a boat
with
214726	the
214728	disciples
of Him
and
He said
214733	to
them
Let us pass over
214737	to
214739	the
214741	other side
214743	of the
lake
And
they launched out
Sailing
then
of them
He fell asleep
And
came down
214754	a storm
of wind
214757	on
214759	the
lake
and
they were being swamped
and
were in danger
Having come to [Him]
then
they awoke
Him
saying
Master
Master
we are perishing
-
And
having arisen
He rebuked
214778	the
wind
and
214782	the
214784	raging
214786	of the
water
and
they ceased
and
there was
a calm
He said
then
to them
Where is
214798	the
214800	faith
of you
Having been afraid
then
they marveled
saying
214807	to
one another
Who
then
this
is
that
even
214816	the
winds
He commands
and
214821	the
water
and
they obey
Him
And
they sailed down
214829	to
214831	the
214833	region
214835	of the
Gerasenes
which
is
214840	opposite
214842	-
Galilee
Having gone forth
then
He
214848	upon
214850	the
land
met [Him]
214856	a man
certain
214859	out of
214861	the
city
having
demons
and
214867	time
a long
not
was wearing
clothing
and
214874	in
a house
not
did abide
but
214880	in
214882	the
tombs
Having seen
then
214887	-
Jesus
having cried out
he fell down before
Him
and
214894	in a voice
loud
said
What
to me
and
to You
Jesus
214903	Son
214905	-
of God
214908	the
Most High
I implore
of You
not
me
You might torment
He was commanding
for
214918	the
214920	spirit
214922	-
unclean
to come out
214926	from
214928	the
man
214931	Many
for
times
it had seized
him
and
he was bound
with chains
and
shackles
being kept
and
breaking
214945	the
chains
he was driven
214949	by
214951	the
demon
214954	into
214956	the
deserts
Asked
now
him
214962	-
Jesus
What
your
name
is
-
And
he said
Legion
because
were entered
214975	demons
many
214978	into
him
And
they were begging
Him
that
not
he would command
them
214988	into
214990	the
abyss
to go away
There was
now
there
214998	a herd
215000	of pigs
many
feeding
215004	in
215006	the
mountain
and
they begged
Him
that
He would allow
them
215015	into
them
to enter
and
He allowed
them
Having gone out
then
215024	the
demons
215027	from
215029	the
man
they entered
215033	into
215035	the
pigs
and
rushed
215040	the
herd
215043	down
215045	the
steep bank
215048	into
215050	the
lake
and
was drowned
Having seen
then
those
feeding [them]
that
having taken place
they fled
and
reported [it]
215064	to
215066	the
city
and
215070	to
215072	the
country
They went out
then
to see
that
having taken place
and
they came
215082	to
215084	-
Jesus
and
found
sitting
215090	the
man
215093	from
whom
215096	the
demons
had gone out
clothed
and
being of sound mind
215103	at
215105	the
215107	feet
215109	-
of Jesus
And
they were afraid
Related
then
to them
those
having seen [it]
how
was healed
the [one]
having been possessed by demons
And
asked
Him
215126	all
215128	the
215130	multitude
215132	of the
215134	surrounding region
215136	of the
Gerasenes
to depart
215140	from
them
because
215144	with fear
great
they were seized
He
now
having entered
215151	into
the boat
turned back
Was begging
however
Him
215158	the
man
215161	from
whom
had gone
215165	the
demons
to be [taken]
215169	with
Him
He sent away
however
him
saying
Return
215177	to
215179	the
215181	house
of you
and
relate
all that
for you
has done
215189	-
God
And
he departed
215194	through
215196	all
215198	the
city
proclaiming
all that
had done
for him
215205	-
Jesus
215208	When
then
-
returned
215213	-
Jesus
received
Him
215218	the
crowd
215221	they were
for
all
looking for
Him
And
behold
came
a man
whose
name [was]
Jairus
and
he
215236	a ruler
215238	of the
synagogue
was
and
having fallen
215244	at
215246	the
215248	feet
of Jesus
he began begging
Him
to come
215254	to
215256	the
215258	house
of him
because
215263	daughter
an only
was
to him
215268	about
215270	years [old]
twelve
and
she
was dying
215276	As
then
-
went
He
215282	the
crowds
were pressing around
Him
And
215288	a woman
being
215291	with
215293	a flux
of blood
215296	for
215298	years
twelve
who
neither
was able
215304	by
no one
to be healed
having come
behind
touched
215311	the
215313	fringe
215315	the
215317	of cloak
of Him
and
immediately
stopped
215323	the
215325	flux
215327	of the
215329	blood
of her
And
said
215334	-
Jesus
Who [is]
the [one]
having touched
Me
Were denying [it]
however
all
said
215345	-
Peter
Master
215349	the
people
surround
You
and
press in
215356	-
But
Jesus
said
Touched
Me
someone
I
for
know
power
has gone out
215369	from
Me
Having seen
then
215374	the
woman
that
not
she was hid
trembling
she came
and
having fallen down before
Him
215385	for
215387	what
cause
she touched
Him
she declared
215393	before
215395	all
215397	the
people
and
how
she was healed
immediately
-
And
He said
to her
Daughter
215409	the
215411	faith
of you
has healed
you
go
215417	in
peace
Still
of Him
speaking
comes
one
215425	from
215427	the
synagogue ruler
saying
-
Has died
215433	the
215435	daughter
of You
no longer
trouble
215440	the
Teacher
215443	-
But
Jesus
having heard
answered
him
Not
fear
only
believe
and
she will be saved
Having entered
then
215458	into
215460	the
house
not
He did allow
to go in
anyone
215467	with
Him
if
not
Peter
and
John
and
James
and
215478	the
215480	father
215482	of the
child
and
215486	the
mother
They were weeping
now
all
and
mourning for
her
-
But
He said
Not
weep
not
she is dead
but
sleeps
And
they were laughing at
Him
knowing
that
she was dead
He
now
having taken hold
215513	of the
215515	hand
of her
called out
saying
215520	-
Child
arise
And
returned
215526	the
215528	spirit
of her
and
she arose
immediately
and
He directed
to her
to be given
to eat
And
were amazed
215541	the
215543	parents
of her
-
and
He instructed
them
no one
to tell
what
had happened
Having called together
then
215556	the
Twelve
He gave
to them
power
and
authority
215564	over
215566	all
215568	the
demons
and
diseases
to heal
and
He sent
them
to proclaim
215578	the
215580	kingdom
215582	-
of God
and
to heal
and
He said
215589	to
them
Nothing
take
215594	for
215596	the
journey
neither
staff
nor
bag
nor
bread
nor
money
nor
215608	apiece
215610	two
tunics
to have
And
215615	into
215617	whatever
-
house
you might enter
there
remain
and
from there
go forth
And
as many as
-
not
might receive
you
going forth
215634	from
215637	the
city
that
215641	the
dust
215644	from
215646	the
215648	feet
of you
shake off
215652	as
215654	a testimony
215656	against
them
Going forth
then
they were passing
215662	through
215664	the
villages
proclaiming the gospel
and
healing
everywhere
Heard of
now
Herod
215674	the
Tetrarch
215677	the things
being done
all
and
was perplexed
215683	because
-
it was said
215687	by
some
-
John
has been raised
215693	out from
[the] dead
215696	by
some
also
that
Elijah
had appeared
by others
also
that
a prophet
215707	one
215709	of the
ancients
had arisen
Said
then
Herod
John
I
beheaded
who
however
is
this
215723	concerning
whom
I hear
such things
And
he was seeking
to see
Him
And
having returned
215734	the
apostles
related
to Him
whatever
they had done
And
having taken
them
He withdrew
215745	by
Himself
215748	into
215750	a town
called
Bethsaida
215754	The
now
crowds
having known [it]
followed
Him
and
having received
them
He was speaking
to them
215766	concerning
215768	the
215770	kingdom
215772	-
of God
and
those
215777	need
having
of healing
He was healing
215782	-
And
the day
began
to decline
having come
then
215790	the
Twelve
said
to Him
Dismiss
215796	the
crowd
that
having gone
215801	into
215803	the
215805	surrounding
villages
and
countryside
they might lodge
and
might find
provisions
for
here
215816	in
215818	a desolate
place
we are
He said
now
215824	to
them
Give
to them
to eat
you
-
But
they said
Not
there are
to us
more
than
215839	loaves
five
and
215843	fish
two
if
not
having gone
we
should buy
215851	for
215854	all
215856	the
people
this
food
They were
for
215863	about
men
five thousand
He said
then
215869	to
215871	the
215873	disciples
of Him
Make sit down
them
215878	groups
215880	of about
215882	in
fifty
And
they did
so
and
made sit down
all
Having taken
then
215893	the
215895	five
loaves
and
215899	the
215901	two
fish
having looked up
215905	to
215907	the
heaven
He blessed
them
and
broke [them]
and
He kept giving [them]
215916	to the
disciples
to set before
215920	the
crowd
And
they ate
and
were satisfied
all
and
was taken up
that
having been a surplus
to them
215933	of fragments
215935	hand-baskets
twelve
And
it came to pass
215940	as
-
215943	was
He
praying
215947	in
solitary
were with
Him
215952	the
disciples
and
He questioned
them
saying
Whom
Me
215961	the
crowds
do pronounce
to be
-
And
answering
they said
John
215971	the
Baptist
others
also
Elijah
others
now
that
215981	a prophet
one
215984	of the
ancients
has arisen
He said
then
to them
You
however
whom
Me
do pronounce
to be
Peter
then
answering
said
216001	The
216003	Christ
216005	-
of God
-
And
having strictly warned
them
He instructed [them]
to no one
to tell
this
having said
-
It is necessary for
216019	the
216021	Son
216023	-
of Man
many things
to suffer
and
to be rejected
216030	by
216032	the
elders
and
chief priests
and
scribes
and
to be killed
and
216042	on the
216044	third
day
to be raised
He was saying
then
216050	to
all
If
anyone
desires
216056	after
Me
to come
let him deny
himself
and
let him take up
216064	the
216066	cross
of him
216069	every
day
and
let him follow
Me
Whoever
for
-
might desire
216079	the
216081	life
of him
to save
will lose
it
whoever
however
-
might lose
216091	the
216093	life
of him
216096	on account of
me
he
will save
it
What
for
is profited
a man
having gained
216107	the
216109	world
whole
himself
now
having destroyed
or
having suffered the loss of
Whoever
for
-
may have been ashamed of
Me
and
216123	-
216125	My
words
him
216129	the
216131	Son
216133	-
of Man
will be ashamed of
when
He shall come
216139	in
216141	the
216143	glory
of Himself
and
216147	of the
Father
and
216151	of the
216153	holy
angels
I say
now
to you
truthfully
there are
216161	some
of those
here
standing
who
216167	no
not
shall taste
of death
until
-
they shall have seen
216175	the
216177	kingdom
216179	-
of God
It came to pass
now
216184	after
216187	the
sayings
these
216191	about
216193	days
eight
and
having taken
Peter
and
John
and
James
He went up
216204	on
216206	the
mountain
to pray
And
it came to pass
216212	in
the
praying
of Him
216217	the
216219	appearance
216221	of the
216223	face
of Him
[was] altered
and
216228	the
216230	clothing
of Him
white
became dazzling
And
behold
216237	men
two
began talking with
Him
who
were
Moses
and
Elijah
Those
having appeared
216249	in
glory
were speaking of
216253	the
216255	going out
of Him
which
He was about
to accomplish
216261	in
Jerusalem
216264	-
And
Peter
and
216269	those
216271	with
him
216274	were
heavy
with sleep
having awoken fully
then
they saw
216281	the
216283	glory
of Him
and
216287	the
216289	two
men
-
standing with
Him
And
it came to pass
216297	in
the
departing
of them
216302	from
Him
said
216306	-
Peter
216309	to
216311	-
Jesus
Master
good
it is
for us
here
to be
also
let us make
216322	tabernacles
three
one
for You
and
one
for Moses
and
one
for Elijah
not
knowing
what
he is saying
These things
then
as he
is saying
came
a cloud
and
was overshadowing
them
they feared
then
216348	in
the
entering
of them
216353	into
216355	the
cloud
And
a voice
came
216361	out of
216363	the
cloud
saying
This
is
216369	the
216371	Son
of Me
-
whom I have chosen
Him
listen to
And
216379	as
-
occurred
216383	the
voice
was found
Jesus
alone
And
they
were silent
and
to no one
they told
216395	in
216397	those
216399	the
days
216402	anything
of what
they had seen
It came to pass
then
216408	the
216410	next
day
on having come down
of them
216415	from
216417	the
mountain
met
Him
216422	a crowd
great
And
behold
216427	a man
216429	from
216431	the
crowd
cried out
saying
Teacher
I implore
You
to look
216440	upon
216442	the
216444	son
of me
for
an only child
to me
he is
And
behold
a spirit
takes
him
and
suddenly
he cries out
and
it throws into convulsions
him
216462	with
foaming
and
with difficulty
it departs
216468	from
him
bruising
him
And
I begged
216475	the
216477	disciples
of You
that
they might cast out
it
and
not
they were able
Answering
now
216488	-
Jesus
said
216492	O
216494	generation
unbelieving
and
perverted
216499	until
when
will I be
216503	with
you
and
bear with
you
Bring
here
216511	the
216513	son
of you
While
then
he was coming near
of him
threw down
him
216522	the
demon
and
threw [him] into convulsions
Rebuked
then
216529	-
Jesus
216532	the
216534	spirit
216536	-
unclean
and
healed
216541	the
boy
and
gave back
him
216547	to
216549	father
of him
Were astonished
then
all
216555	at
216557	the
216559	majesty
216561	-
of God
Of all
however
wondering
216567	at
216569	all
which
He did
He said
216574	to
216576	the
216578	disciples
of Him
Let sink
you
216583	into
216585	the
216587	ears
of you
216591	the
words
these
216595	-
for
216598	the Son
216600	-
of Man
is about
to be betrayed
216605	into
216607	[the] hands
of men
-
But
they understand not
216614	the
saying
this
and
216619	it was
veiled
216622	from
them
that
not
they should understand
it
And
they were afraid
to ask
Him
216633	concerning
216636	the
saying
this
Came up
then
an argument
216643	among
them
this
216647	who
-
might be
greatest
of them
216653	-
But
Jesus
having known
216658	the
216660	reasoning
216662	of the
216664	heart
of them
having taken hold of
a child
set
it
216671	by
Him
and
He said
to them
Whoever
if
shall receive
216680	this
216682	-
child
216685	in
216687	the
216689	name
of Me
Me
receives
and
whoever
-
Me
shall receive
receives
the [One]
having sent
Me
The [one]
for
least
216706	among
216708	all
you
being
he
shall be
great
Answering
now
216717	-
John
said
Master
we saw
someone
216724	in
216726	the
216728	name
of You
casting out
demons
and
we were forbidding
him
because
not
he follows
216739	with
us
Said
then
216744	to
him
Jesus
Not
forbid
whoever
for
not
is
216754	against
you
216757	for
you
is
It came to pass
then
216763	in
the
completing
216767	the
216769	days
216771	of the
216773	ascension
of Him
that
He
216778	the
face
steadfastly set
-
to go
216784	to
Jerusalem
And
He sent
messengers
216790	before
216792	[the] face
of Him
And
having gone
they entered
216798	into
216800	a village
of the Samaritans
so as
to make ready
for Him
And
not
they did receive
Him
because
216811	the
216813	face
of Him
216816	was [as]
going
216819	toward
Jerusalem
Having seen [it]
now
216824	the
disciples
James
and
John
said
Lord
will You [that]
we should call
fire
to come down
216836	from
216838	-
heaven
and
to consume
them
Having turned
then
He rebuked
them
And
they went
216850	to
216852	another
village
And
going
of them
216858	along
216860	the
road
said
someone
216865	to
Him
I will follow
You
wherever
if
You may go
And
said
to him
216876	-
Jesus
216879	The
foxes
holes
have
and
216885	the
216887	birds
216889	of the
air
nests
216893	-
but
216896	the Son
216898	-
of Man
not
has
where
216904	the
head
He might lay
He said
then
216910	to
another
Follow
Me
-
But
he said
allow
me
first
having gone away
to bury
216923	the
216925	father
of me
He said
then
to him
Leave
216932	the
dead
to bury
216936	-
216938	their own
dead
you
however
having gone forth
declare
216945	the
216947	kingdom
216949	-
of God
Said
then
216954	also
another
I will follow
You
Lord
first
however
allow
me
to bid farewell
216965	to those
216967	at
216969	the
216971	home
of me
Said
then
216976	to
him
216979	-
Jesus
No one
having laid
216984	the
hand
216987	upon
[the] plow
and
looking
216992	on
216994	the things
behind
fit
is
216999	for the
217001	kingdom
217003	-
of God
217006	After
now
these things
appointed
217011	the
Lord
217014	others
seventy
and
sent
them
217020	in
two [by]
217023	before
217025	[the] face
of Himself
217028	into
217030	every
city
and
place
where
was about
He Himself
to go
He was saying
then
217041	to
them
217044	The
indeed
harvest [is]
plentiful
217049	-
but
the workmen
[are] few
Pray earnestly to
therefore
217056	the
217058	Lord
217060	of the
harvest
that
workmen
He may send out
217066	into
217068	the
217070	harvest
of Him
Go
behold
I send forth
you
as
lambs
217079	in
217081	[the] midst
of wolves
Neither
carry
purse
nor
bag
nor
sandals
and
no one
217093	on
217095	the
road
greet
217099	Into
217101	whatever
now
-
you might enter
house
first
say
Peace
217111	to the
house
this
And
if
there
is
217119	a son
of peace
will rest
217123	upon
him
217126	the
217128	peace
of you
if
however
not so
217134	to
you
it will return
217138	In
217140	the same
now
217143	-
house
remain
eating
and
drinking
217150	the things [supplied]
217152	by
them
worthy [is]
for
217157	the
workman
217160	of the
217162	wages
of him
Not
move
217167	from
house
217170	to
house
And
217174	into
217176	whatever
-
city
you might enter
and
they receive
you
eat
the things
set before
you
And
heal
217190	-
217193	in
it
[the] sick
and
say
to them
Has drawn near
217201	to
you
217204	the
217206	kingdom
217208	-
of God
217211	Into
217213	whatever
now
-
city
you might enter
and
not
they receive
you
having gone out
217224	into
217226	the
217228	streets
of it
say
217232	Even
217234	the
dust
-
having clung
to us
217240	out of
217242	the
217244	city
of you
217247	to
217249	the
feet
we wipe off
against you
yet
this
know
that
has drawn near
217259	the
217261	kingdom
217263	-
of God
I say
to you
that
for Sodom
217270	in
217273	the
day
that
more tolerable
it will be
than
217281	the
city
for that
Woe
to you
Chorazin
Woe
to you
Bethsaida
For
if
217293	in
Tyre
and
Sidon
had taken place
217299	the
miracles
-
having taken place
217304	in
you
long ago
-
217309	in
sackcloth
and
ashes
sitting
they would have repented
But
for Tyre
and
Sidon
more tolerable
will it be
217322	in
217324	the
judgment
than
for you
And
you
Capernaum
not
217333	to
heaven
will you be lifted up
217337	to
217339	-
Hades
you will be brought down
The [one]
hearing
you
Me
hears
and
the [one]
rejecting
you
Me
rejects
the [one]
now
Me
rejecting
rejects
the [One]
having sent
Me
Returned
then
217364	the
seventy
217367	with
joy
saying
Lord
217372	even
217374	the
demons
are subject
to us
217379	through
217381	the
217383	name
of You
He said
then
to them
I beheld
217390	-
Satan
as
lightning
217395	out of
217397	the
heaven
having fallen
Behold
I give
you
217404	the
authority
-
to tread
217409	upon
serpents
and
scorpions
and
217415	upon
217417	all
217419	the
217421	power
217423	of the
enemy
and
nothing
you
217429	no
not
will injure
Yet
217434	in
this
not
rejoice
that
217440	the
spirits
to you
are subjected
rejoice
however
that
217448	the
217450	names
of you
are written
217454	in
217456	the
heavens
217459	In
217461	the same
217463	-
hour
He rejoiced
217467	the
217469	Spirit
217471	-
Holy
and
said
I fully consent
to You
Father
217479	Lord
217481	of the
heaven
and
217485	of the
earth
that
You have hidden
these things
217491	from
wise
and
intelligent
and
have revealed
them
to little children
yes
217501	-
Father
for
thus
well-pleasing
was it
217508	before
You
All things
to Me
have been delivered
217514	by
217516	the
217518	Father
of Me
And
no one
knows
who
is
217526	the
Son
if
not
217531	the
Father
and
who
is
217537	the
Father
if
not
217542	the
Son
and
to whom
if
might resolve
217549	the
Son
to reveal [Him]
And
having turned
217555	to
217557	the
disciples
217560	in
private
He said
Blessed [are]
217565	the
eyes
-
seeing
what
you see
I say
for
to you
that
217576	many
prophets
and
kings
desired
to see
what
you
see
and
not
saw
and
to hear
what
you hear
and
not
heard
And
behold
217598	a lawyer
certain
stood up
testing
Him
saying
Teacher
what
having done
217608	life
eternal
will I inherit
-
And
He said
217615	to
him
217618	In
217620	the
law
what
has been written
How
read you
-
And
answering
he said
You shall love
[the] Lord
217633	the
217635	God
of you
217638	with
217640	all
217642	the
217644	heart
of you
and
217648	with
217650	all
217652	the
217654	soul
of you
and
217658	with
217660	all
217662	the
217664	strength
of you
and
217668	with
217670	all
217672	the
217674	mind
of you
and
217678	The
217680	neighbor
of you
as
yourself
He said
then
to him
Correctly
you have answered
This
do
and
you will live
-
But
desiring
to justify
himself
he said
217700	to
217702	-
Jesus
And
who
is
217708	my
neighbor
Having taken [it] up
217712	-
Jesus
said
217716	A man
certain
was going down
217720	from
Jerusalem
217723	to
Jericho
and
robbers
fell among
who
both
having stripped
him
and
wounds
having inflicted
went away
having left [him]
half dead
217739	By
chance
now
217743	a priest
certain
was going down
217747	on
217750	the
road
that
and
having seen
him
he passed by on the opposite side
Likewise
now
217760	also
a Levite
217763	to
217765	the
spot
having come
and
having seen [him]
passed by on the opposite side
217772	A Samaritan
however
one
journeying
came
217778	to
him
and
having seen
was moved with compassion
and
having approached
he bound up
217787	the
217789	wounds
of him
pouring on
oil
and
wine
having put
then
him
217799	on
217801	the
217803	own
beast
he brought
him
217808	to
an inn
and
took care
of him
And
217815	on
217817	the
next day
having taken out
217821	two
denarii
he gave [them]
217825	to the
innkeeper
and
said
Take care
of him
and
whatever
more
-
you might expend
of me
217838	on
-
returning
I
will repay
you
217845	Which
217847	of these
217849	-
three
217852	a neighbor
seems
to you
to have been
of the [one]
having fallen
217859	among
217861	the
robbers
-
And
he said
The [one]
having shown
217869	-
compassion
217872	toward
him
Said
then
to him
217878	-
Jesus
Go
and
you
do
likewise
217886	In
now
the
proceeding
of them
He
entered
217894	into
217896	a village
certain
217900	a woman
now
certain
named
Martha
received
Him
217908	into
217910	the
home
And
she
had
217916	a sister
called
Mary
who
also
having sat down
217923	at
217925	the
217927	feet
217929	of the
Lord
was listening to
217933	the
217935	word
of Him
217938	-
But
Martha
was distracted
217943	about
217945	much
service
having come up
now
she said
Lord
not
is it concerning
to You
that
217956	the
217958	sister
of me
217961	alone
me
has left
to serve
Speak
therefore
to her
that
me
she might help
Answering
now
said
to her
217976	the
Lord
Martha
Martha
you are anxious
and
troubled
217984	about
many things
217987	one thing
however
is
necessary
and
one thing
Mary
for
217996	the
217998	good
portion
has chosen
which
not
will be taken away from
her
And
it came to pass
218008	in
-
218011	being
His
218014	in
218016	a place
certain
praying
when
He ceased
said
218023	one
218025	of the
218027	disciples
of Him
218030	to
Him
Lord
teach
us
to pray
as
218038	also
John
taught
218042	the
218044	disciples
of him
He said
then
to them
When
you pray
say
Father
hallowed be
218055	the
218057	name
of You
Come
218061	the
218063	kingdom
of You
218066	The
218069	bread
of us
218072	-
daily
give
us
218077	-
218079	each
day
And
forgive
us
218085	the
218087	sins
of us
218090	also
for
ourselves
we forgive
218095	everyone
indebted
to us
and
not
lead
us
218103	into
temptation
And
He said
218108	to
them
218111	Who
218113	among
you
will have
a friend
and
will go
218120	to
him
at midnight
and
say
to him
Friend
lend
me
218130	three
loaves
since
218134	a friend
of my
is come
218138	off
a journey
218141	to
me
and
nothing
I have
what
I will set before
him
And he
from within
answering
will say
Not
me
trouble
cause
already
218159	the
door
has been shut
and
218164	the
218166	children
of me
218169	with
me
218172	in
218174	the
bed
are
not
I am able
having risen up
to give
to you
I say
to you
if
even
not
he will give
to him
having risen up
218191	because of
-
being
218195	friend
of him
218198	because of
yet
218201	the
218203	persistence
of him
having risen
he will give
him
as much as
he needs
And I
to you
say
ask
and
it will be given
to you
seek
and
you will find
knock
and
it will be opened
to you
218225	Everyone
for
-
asking
receives
and
the [one]
seeking
finds
and
to the [one]
knocking
it will be opened
218239	Which
now
218242	of
you
218245	who [is]
a father
will ask for
218249	the
son
a fish
and
218254	instead of
a fish
a serpent
to him
will he give
Or
also
[if] he will ask for
an egg
will he give
to him
a scorpion
If
therefore
you
evil
being
know
218273	gifts
good
to give
218277	to the
218279	children
of you
218282	how much
more
218285	the
Father
218288	who [is]
218290	in
heaven
will give
218294	[the] Spirit
Holy
to those
asking
Him
And
218301	He was
casting out
a demon
and
it
was
mute
it came to pass
then
218311	the
demon
having gone out
spoke
218316	the
mute [man]
And
marveled
218321	the
crowds
218324	Some
then
218327	of
them
said
218331	By
Beelzebul
218334	the
218336	prince
218338	of the
demons
He casts out
218342	the
demons
Others
now
testing
218348	a sign
218350	from
heaven
were seeking
218354	from
Him
He
now
knowing
218360	their
218362	-
thoughts
said
to them
218367	Every
218369	kingdom
218371	against
itself
having been divided
is brought to desolation
and
a house
218378	against
a house
falls
If
now
218384	also
218386	-
Satan
218389	against
himself
is divided
how
will stand
218395	the
218397	kingdom
of him
For
you say
218402	by
Beelzebul
cast out
I
218407	the
demons
If
now
I
218413	by
Beelzebul
cast out
218417	the
demons
218420	the
218422	sons
of you
218425	by
whom
do they cast out
218429	On account of
this
they
218433	of you
judges
will be
If
however
218439	by
218441	[the] finger
of God
I
cast out
218446	the
demons
then
has come
218451	upon
you
218454	the
218456	kingdom
218458	-
of God
When
218462	the
strong [man]
being armed
might guard
218467	-
218469	his
house
218472	in
peace
are
218476	the
possessions
of him
when
however
218482	[one] stronger
than he
having come upon [him]
shall overcome
him
218488	the
218490	complete armor
of him
he takes away
218494	in
which
he had trusted
and
218499	the
218501	plunder
of him
he divides
The [one]
not
being
218508	with
Me
218511	against
Me
is
and
the [one]
not
gathering
218519	with
Me
scatters
When
218524	the
218526	unclean
spirit
is gone out
218530	from
218532	the
man
it passes
218536	through
218538	waterless
places
seeking
rest
and
not
finding [any]
it says
I will return
218548	to
218550	the
218552	house
of me
from where
I came out
And
having come
it finds [it]
swept
and
put in order
Then
it goes
and
takes
218567	other
218570	spirits
218572	more evil
than itself
seven
and
having entered
they dwell
there
and
becomes
218582	the
218584	last
218587	of the
man
that
worse
218592	than the
first
It came to pass
then
218597	in
-
saying
His
these things
having lifted up
218604	one
[her] voice
218607	a woman
218609	from
218611	the
crowd
said
to Him
Blessed [is]
218617	the
womb
-
having borne
You
and
[the] breasts
at which
You nursed
He
then
said
No rather
blessed [are]
218632	those
hearing
218635	the
218637	word
218639	-
of God
and
keeping it
218644	Of the
now
crowds
being pressed around together
He began
to say
218652	The
generation
this
218656	generation
an evil
is
a sign
it seeks after
and
a sign
not
will be given
to it
if
not
218669	the
218671	sign
of Jonah
As
for
was
Jonah
218678	to the
Ninevites
a sign
thus
will be
218684	also
218686	the
218688	Son
218690	-
of Man
218694	to the
generation
this
218698	The Queen
of [the] South
will rise up
218702	in
218704	the
judgment
218707	with
218709	the
218711	men
218714	of the
generation
this
and
will condemn
them
For
she came
218723	from
218725	the
218727	ends
218729	of the
earth
to hear
218733	the
218735	wisdom
of Solomon
and
behold
218740	greater
than Solomon
here
[The] men
of Nineveh
will stand up
218747	in
218749	the
judgment
218752	with
218755	the
generation
this
and
will condemn
it
For
they repented
218764	at
218766	the
218768	preaching
of Jonah
and
behold
218773	greater
than Jonah
[is] here
But no one
a lamp
having lit
218780	in
secret
sets it
nor
218785	under
218787	the
basket
but
218791	upon
218793	the
lampstand
that
those
entering in
218799	the
light
may see
218803	The
218805	lamp
218807	of your
body
is
218811	the
218813	eye
of you
When
218817	the
218819	eye
of you
clear
is
218824	also
218826	all
218828	the
218830	body
of you
light
is
when
however
evil
it be
218839	also
218841	the
218843	body
of you
[is] dark
Take heed
therefore
lest
218850	the
light
218853	that [is]
218855	in
you
darkness
be
If
therefore
218863	the
218865	body
of you
[is] full
of light
not
having
218873	part
any
dark
it will be
218878	light
all
as
when
218883	the
lamp
218886	-
shining
might light
you
218891	In
then
the
speaking
asked
Him
a Pharisee
that
He would dine
218901	with
him
having entered
then
He reclined
218907	-
And
the Pharisee
having seen [it]
marveled
that
not
first
He washed
218917	before
218919	the
dinner
Said
then
218924	the
Lord
218927	to
him
Now
you
218932	-
Pharisees
218935	the
218937	outside
218939	of the
cup
and
218943	of the
dish
you cleanse
218947	-
and
218950	the inside
of you
is full
of plundering
and
wickedness
Fools
[Did] not
the [One]
having made
218961	the
outside
218964	also
218966	the
inside
make
But [of]
the things
being within
give
alms
and
behold
all things
clean
to you
are
But
woe
to you
218984	-
Pharisees
for
you pay tithes of
218989	-
mint
and
218993	-
rue
and
218997	every
herb
and
you pass by
219002	the
justice
and
219006	the
219008	love
219010	-
of God
These things
also
it behooved [you]
to do
and those
not
to neglect
Woe
to you
219022	-
Pharisees
for
you love
219027	the
219029	first seat
219031	in
219033	the
synagogues
and
219037	the
219039	greetings
219041	in
219043	the
marketplaces
Woe
to you
for
you are
219050	like
219052	-
219054	graves
219056	-
unmarked
and
219060	the
men
-
walking
above
not
have known [it]
Answering
now
219070	one
219072	of the
lawyers
says
to Him
Teacher
these things
saying
219080	also
us
You insult
-
And
He said
219087	Also
to you
219090	the
lawyers
woe
For
you burden
219096	the
men
219099	[with] burdens
heavy to bear
and
yourselves
219104	with one
219106	of the
219108	fingers
of you
not
do touch
219113	the
burdens
Woe
to you
for
you build
219120	the
219122	tombs
219124	of the
prophets
219127	-
yet
219130	the fathers
of you
killed
them
So
witnesses
you are
and
consent
219140	to the
219142	works
219144	of the
219146	fathers
of you
For
they
indeed
killed
them
you
now
build [their tombs]
219157	Because of
this
219160	also
219162	the
219164	Wisdom
219166	-
of God
said
I will send
219171	to
them
prophets
and
apostles
and
219178	[some] of
them
they will kill
and
persecute
so that
might be charged
219186	the
219188	blood
219190	of all
219192	the
prophets
-
having been poured out
219197	from
219199	[the] foundation
of [the] world
219202	against
219205	the
generation
this
219209	from
219211	the blood
of Abel
219214	to
219216	the blood
of Zechariah
the [one]
having perished
219221	between
219223	the
altar
and
219227	the
house
Yes
I say
to you
it will be required
219234	of
219237	the
generation
this
Woe
to you
219243	the
lawyers
for
you have taken away
219248	the
219250	key
219252	of the
knowledge
You yourselves
not
did enter
and
those who
are entering
you hindered
From there
having gone forth
of Him
began
219266	the
scribes
and
219270	the
Pharisees
urgently
to press upon [Him]
and
to make speak
Him
219278	about
many things
watching
Him
to catch
in something
219285	out of
219287	the
219289	mouth
of Him
219292	In
these [times]
having been gathered together
219296	the
219298	myriads
219300	of the
crowd
so as
to trample upon
one another
He began
to say
219308	to
219310	the
219312	disciples
of Him
first
Take heed
to yourselves
219318	of
219320	the
219322	leaven
which
is
hypocrisy
219327	of the
Pharisees
Nothing
now
concealed up
is
which
not
will be revealed
nor
hidden
which
not
will be known
219342	Instead
that
whatever
219346	in
219348	the
darkness
you have said
219352	in
219354	the
light
will be heard
and
what
219360	into
219362	the
ear
you have spoken
219366	in
219368	the
inner rooms
will be proclaimed
219372	upon
219374	the
housetops
I say
now
to you
219380	those
219382	friends
of Me
not
you should fear
219387	because
of those
killing
219391	the
body
and
219395	after
these things
not
being able
219400	more abundantly
anything
to do
I will show
however
you
whom
you should fear
Fear
the [One who]
219411	after
the
killing
has
authority
to cast
219418	into
219420	-
hell
Yes
I say
to you
Him
fear
Not
219429	five
sparrows
are sold for
219433	assarion
two
And
219437	one
219439	of
them
not
219443	is
forgotten
219446	before
219448	-
God
But
219452	even
219455	the
219457	hairs
219459	of the
219461	head
of you
all
have been numbered
Not
fear
219468	than many
sparrows
you are more valuable
I say
now
to you
219475	everyone
who
-
will confess
219480	in
Me
219483	before
219485	the
men
219488	also
219490	the
219492	Son
219494	-
of Man
will confess
219498	in
him
219501	before
219503	the
219505	angels
219507	-
of God
the [one]
now
having denied
Me
219514	before
219516	-
men
will be denied
219520	before
219522	the
219524	angels
219526	-
of God
And
219530	everyone
who
will speak
a word
219535	against
219537	the
219539	Son
219541	-
of Man
it will be forgiven
him
the [one]
however
219548	against
219550	the
219552	Holy
Spirit
having blasphemed
not
will be forgiven
When
then
they bring
you
219562	before
219564	the
synagogues
and
219568	the
rulers
and
219572	the
authorities
not
be anxious
how
or
what
you shall reply in defense
or
what
you should say
219584	the
for
219587	Holy
Spirit
will teach
you
219592	in
219594	same
219596	the
hour
what
it behooves [you]
to say
Said
then
219604	one
219606	from
219608	the
crowd
to Him
Teacher
say
219614	to the
219616	brother
of me
to divide
219620	with
me
219623	the
inheritance
-
And
He said
to him
Man
who
Me
appointed
219634	a judge
or
partitioner
219638	over
you
He said
then
219643	to
them
Beware
and
keep yourselves
219649	from
219651	all
covetousness
for
not
219656	in
the
abundance
to anyone
219661	the
219663	life
to him
is
219667	of
that which
possesses
of him
He spoke
then
a parable
219675	to
them
saying
219681	Of a man
certain
rich
brought forth abundantly
219686	the
ground
And
he was reasoning
219691	within
himself
saying
What
shall I do
for
not
I have
where
I will store up
219702	the
219704	fruits
of me
And
he said
This
will I do
I will tear down
219712	my
219714	-
barns
and
greater
will build
and
will store up
there
219723	all
219726	the
grain
and
219730	the
goods
of me
And
I will say
219736	to the
219738	soul
of me
Soul
you have
219743	many
219745	good things
laid up
219748	for
219750	years
many
take your rest
eat
drink
be merry
Said
then
to him
219760	-
God
Fool
219764	This
219766	-
night
219769	the
219771	soul
of you
is required
219775	of
you
what
now
you did prepare
to whom
will [it] be
So [is]
the [one]
treasuring up
for himself
and
not
219789	toward
God
being rich
He said
then
219795	to
219797	the
219799	disciples
of Him
219802	Because of
this
I say
to you
not
be anxious
219809	for the
life
what
you should eat
nor
219815	for the
body
what
you should put on
219820	The
for
life
more than
is
219826	the
food
and
219830	the
body
219833	than the
clothing
Consider
219837	the
ravens
that
not
they sow
nor
reap
to them
not
there is
a storehouse
nor
barn
and
219852	-
God
feeds
them
219857	How much
more
you
are valuable
219862	than the
birds
219865	Which
now
219868	of
you
being anxious
is able
219873	to
219875	the
219877	lifespan
of him
to add
one hour
If
then
not even
[the] least
you are able [to do]
why
219888	about
219890	the
rest
are you anxious
Consider
219895	the
lilies
how
Not
do they labor
nor
do they spin
I say
however
to you
not even
Solomon
219908	in
219910	all
219912	the
219914	glory
of him
was arrayed
as
219919	one
of these
If
however
219925	in [the]
field
219928	the
grass
being [here]
today
and
tomorrow
219935	into
the furnace
being thrown
219939	-
God
thus
clothes
219944	how much
more
you
O [you] of little faith
219949	And
you
not
seek
what
you might eat
and
what
you might drink
and
not
be in suspense
219962	these things
for
all
219966	the
219968	nations
219970	of the
world
seek after
219974	of you
now
219977	the
Father
knows
that
you have need
of these
But
seek you
219986	the
219988	kingdom
of Him
and
these things
will be added
to you
Not
fear
219997	-
219999	little
flock
for
took delight
220004	the
220006	Father
of you
to give
you
220011	the
kingdom
Sell
220015	the
possessions
of you
and
give
alms
make
to yourselves
220024	purses
not
growing old
220029	a treasure
unfailing
220032	in
220034	the
heavens
where
thief
not
does draw near
nor
moth
destroy
Where
for
is
220047	the
220049	treasure
of you
there
220053	also
220055	the
220057	heart
of you
will be
Let be
220062	your
220064	-
waist
girded about
and
220069	the
lamps
burning
and
you
like
220076	to men
waiting for
220079	the
220081	master
of themselves
whenever
he shall return
220086	from
220088	the
wedding feasts
that
having come
and
having knocked
immediately
they might open
to him
Blessed [are]
220100	the
servants
those
whom
having come
220106	the
master
will find
watching
Truly
I say
to you
that
he will gird himself
and
will make recline
them
and
having come up
will serve
them
And if
220124	in
220126	the
second
and if
220130	in
220132	the
220134	third
watch
he comes
and
finds [them]
thus
blessed
are
those
This
however
know
that
if
had known
220150	the
master of the house
220153	in what
hour
220156	the
thief
is coming
not
-
he would have allowed
to be broken into
220164	the
220166	house
of him
220169	Also
you
be
ready
for
220175	in the
hour
not
you expect
220180	the
220182	Son
220184	-
of Man
comes
Said
then
220190	-
Peter
Lord
220194	to
us
220198	the
parable
this
speak You
or
also
220205	to
all
And
said
220210	the
Lord
Who
then
is
220216	the
220218	faithful
220220	manager
220222	[and] the
wise
whom
will set
220227	the
master
220230	over
220232	the
220234	care [of servants]
of him
-
to give [them]
220239	in
season
220242	the
measure of food
Blessed [is]
220247	the
servant
that
whom
having come
220253	the
220255	master
of him
will find
doing
thus
Of a truth
I say
to you
that
220265	over
220267	all
220269	the
possessions
of him
he will set
him
If
however
should say
220279	the
servant
that
220283	in
220285	the
220287	heart
of him
Delays
220291	the
220293	master
of Me
to come
and
should begin
to beat
220300	the
men-servants
and
220304	the
maid-servants
to eat
also
and
to drink
and
to get drunk
will come
220314	the
220316	master
220319	of the
servant
that
220323	in
a day
in which
not
he does expect
and
220330	in
an hour
that
not
he knows
and
he will cut in two
him
and
220340	the
220342	place
of him
220345	with
220347	the
unbelievers
will appoint
220351	That
now
220354	-
servant
the [one]
having known
220359	the
220361	will
220363	of the
220365	master
of him
and
not
having prepared
nor
having done
220373	according to
220375	the
220377	will
of him
will be beaten with
many [blows]
the [one]
however
not
having known
having done
however
220388	[things] worthy
of stripes
will be beaten with
few
220393	Everyone
now
to whom
has been given
much
much
will be required
220401	from
him
and
to whom
has been committed
much
the more
will they ask of
him
Fire
I came
to cast
220414	upon
220416	the
earth
and
how
I wish
if
already
it be kindled
Baptism
however
I have
to be baptized [with]
and
how
I am distressed
220432	until
while
it should be accomplished
Think you
that
peace
I came
to give
220441	on
220443	the
earth
No
I say
to you
220449	but
rather
division
220453	There will be
for
220456	from
220458	-
now
220461	five
220463	in
220465	one
house
divided
three
220470	against
two
and
two
220475	against
three
They will be divided
father
220480	against
son
and
son
220485	against
father
mother
220489	against
daughter
and
daughter
220494	against
220496	-
mother

220500	against
220502	the
220504	daughter-in-law
of her
and
daughter-in-law
220509	against
220511	-

He was saying
now
220516	also
220518	to the
crowds
When
you see
cloud
rising up
220525	from
[the] west
immediately
you say
-
A shower
is coming
and
it happens
so
And
when
a south wind
is blowing
you say
-
Heat
there will be
and
it happens
Hypocrites
220547	The
220549	appearance
220551	of the
earth
and
220555	of the
sky
you know [how]
to discern
220561	the
time
however
this
how
not
to discern
Why
now
220571	even
220573	for
yourselves
not
judge you
220578	what [is]
right
As
for
you are going
220584	with
220586	the
220588	adversary
of you
220591	before
a magistrate
220594	in
220596	the
way
give
earnestness
to be set free
220602	from
him
lest
ever
he should drag away
you
220609	to
220611	the
judge
and
220615	the
judge
you
will deliver
220620	to the
officer
and
220624	the
officer
you
will cast
220629	into
prison
I say
to you
220634	no
not
shall you come out
from there
until
220640	even
220642	the
220644	last
lepton
you shall have paid
Were present
now
some
220651	at
220653	the same
220655	-
time
telling
Him
220660	about
220662	the
Galileans
220665	of whom
220667	the
blood
Pilate
had mingled
220672	with
220674	the
220676	sacrifices
of them
And
answering
He said
to them
Think you
that
220686	-
Galileans
these
sinners
220691	beyond
220693	all
220695	the
Galileans
were
because
such things
they have suffered
No
I say
to you
but
if
not
you repent
all
likewise
you will perish
Or
220713	those
220715	-
ten [and]
eight
220719	on
whom
fell
220723	the
220725	tower
220727	in
220729	-
Siloam
and
killed
them
think you
that
these
debtors
were
220740	beyond
220742	all
220744	the
men
-
dwelling
in Jerusalem
No
I say
to you
but
if
not
you repent
all
likewise
you will perish
He was speaking
then
220762	this
220764	-
parable
A fig tree
had
a certain [man]
planted
220771	in
220773	the
220775	vineyard
of him
and
he came
seeking
fruit
220782	on
it
and
not
did find [any]
He said
then
220790	to
220792	the
vinedresser
Behold
220796	three
years
220799	throughout
these
I come
seeking
fruit
220805	on
220808	the
fig tree
this
and
not
do find [any]
Cut down
it
220817	that
why
220820	even
220822	the
ground
should it use up
-
And
answering
he says
to him
Sir
let alone
it
220834	also
220836	this
220838	the
year
220841	until
when
I shall dig
220845	around
it
and
put [in]
manure
and if
indeed
it should bear
fruit
220855	in
the [time]
so be it
If
however
not
you will cut down
it
220864	He was
now
teaching
220868	in
220870	one
220872	of the
synagogues
220875	on
220877	the
Sabbaths
And
behold
220882	a woman
220884	a spirit
having
of infirmity
220888	years
ten [and]
eight
And
she was
bent over
and
not
able
to lift up herself
220899	to
220901	the
full
Having seen
then
her
220907	-
Jesus
called [her] near
and
said
to her
Woman
you have been freed from
220916	the
220918	sickness
of you
And
He laid
upon her
220924	the
hands
and
immediately
she was made straight
and
began to glorify
220932	-
God
Answering
now
220937	the
ruler of the synagogue
indignant
because
220942	on the
Sabbath
had healed
220946	-
Jesus
he was saying
220950	to the
crowd
-
220954	Six
days
there are
220958	in
which
it behooves
to work
220963	in
these
therefore
coming
be healed
and
not
220971	on the
220973	day
220975	of the
Sabbath
Answered
therefore
him
220981	the
Lord
and
said
Hypocrites
220987	Each one
of you
220990	on the
Sabbath
not
does he untie
220995	the
220997	ox
of him
or
221001	the
donkey
221004	from
221006	the
stall
and
having led [it] away
give [it] to drink
221012	This
now
221015	a daughter
of Abraham
being
whom
has bound
221021	-
Satan
behold
221025	ten
and
eight
years
not
ought [she]
to be loosed
221033	from
221035	the
221037	bond
this
221040	on the
221042	day
221044	of the
Sabbath
And
these things
on saying
of Him
were ashamed
221052	all
those
opposed
to Him
and
221058	all
221060	the
crowd
was rejoicing
221064	at
221066	all
221068	the
glorious things
that
were being done
221073	by
Him
He was saying
then
To what
like
is
221081	the
221083	kingdom
221085	-
of God
And
to what
shall I liken
it
Like
it is
221094	to a grain
of mustard
which
having taken
a man
cast
221101	into
221103	garden
his
and
it grew
and
came
221110	into
a tree
and
221114	the
221116	birds
221118	of the
air
encamped
221122	in
221124	the
221126	branches
of it
And
again
He said
To what
shall I liken
221134	the
221136	kingdom
221138	-
of God
Like
it is
to leaven
which
having taken
a woman
hid
221148	in
221150	of meal
221152	measures
three
221155	until
it
was leavened
all
And
He was going through
221162	by
towns
and
villages
teaching
and
progress
making
221171	toward
Jerusalem
Said
then
one
to Him
Lord
if
[are] few
those
being saved
-
And
He said
221186	to
them
Strive
to enter in
221191	through
221193	the
221195	narrow
door
for
many
I say
to you
will seek
to enter in
and
not
will be able
221207	From
what
-
shall have risen up
221212	the
master of the house
and
shall have shut
221217	the
door
then
you should begin
outside
to stand
and
to knock
221226	at the
door
saying
Lord
open
to us
And
he answering
will say
to you
Not
I do know
you
from where
are
Then
will you begin
to say
We ate
221246	in presence
of you
and
drank
and
221252	in
221254	the
221256	streets
of us
you taught
And
he will say
I tell
you
not
I do know
from where
you are
depart
221269	from
me
221272	all [you]
221274	workers
of unrighteousness
There
will be
221279	the
weeping
and
221283	the
221285	gnashing
221287	of the
teeth
when
you see
Abraham
and
Isaac
and
Jacob
and
221298	all
221300	the
prophets
221303	in
221305	the
221307	kingdom
221309	-
of God
you
however
are being cast
out
And
they will come
221318	from
east
and
west
and
221324	from
north
and
south
and
will recline
221331	in
221333	the
221335	kingdom
221337	-
of God
And
behold
there are
last
who
will be
first
and
there are
first
who
will be
last
221353	In
221355	same
221357	the
hour
came near
221361	certain
Pharisees
saying
to Him
Go out
and
proceed
from here
for
Herod
desires
You
to kill
And
He said
to them
Having gone
say
221381	to the
fox
that
Behold
I cast out
demons
and
cures
I complete
today
and
tomorrow
and
221395	the
third [day]
I am perfected
But
it behooves
Me
today
and
tomorrow
and
the [day]
following
to proceed
for
not
it is possible [for]
a prophet
to perish
221414	outside of
Jerusalem
Jerusalem
Jerusalem
-
killing
221421	the
prophets
and
stoning
those
having been sent
221428	to
her
how often
I have wanted
to gather
221434	those
221436	children
of you
221439	that
way
a hen [gathers]
221443	-
221445	her
brood
221448	under
221450	the
wings
and
not
you were willing
Behold
is left
to you
221459	the
221461	house
of you
I say
now
to you
221467	no
not
shall you see
Me
until
[the time] comes
when
you say
Blessed is
the [One]
coming
221479	in
221481	[the] name
of [the] Lord
And
it came to pass
221486	on
the
going
of Him
221491	into
221493	a house
221495	of one
221497	of the
221499	rulers
221501	of the
Pharisees
on a Sabbath
to eat
bread
and
they
221509	were
watching
Him
And
behold
221516	a man
certain
there was
with dropsy
221521	before
Him
And
answering
221526	-
Jesus
spoke
221530	to
221532	the
lawyers
and
to [the] Pharisees
saying
Is it lawful
221539	on the
Sabbath
to heal
or
not
-
But
they were silent
And
having taken hold [of him]
He healed
him
and
let [him] go
And
221555	to
them
He said
221560	Which
of you
a son
or
an ox
221566	into
a pit
will fall
also
not
immediately
he will pull up
him
221575	on
221577	day
221579	the
Sabbath
And
not
they were able
to reply
221586	to
these things
He was speaking
then
221591	to
those
having been invited
a parable
remarking
how
221598	the
first places
they were choosing out
saying
221603	to
them
When
you are invited
221608	by
anyone
221611	to
wedding feasts
not
do recline
221616	in
221618	the
first place
lest
ever
221623	[one] more honorable
than you
221626	might have been
invited
221629	by
him
and
having come
the [one]
you
and
him
having invited
will say
to you
Give
to this one
[your] place
and
then
you should begin
221647	with
shame
221650	the
221652	last
place
to take
But
when
you are invited
having gone
recline
221661	in
221663	the
221665	last
place
so that
when
might come
the [one]
having invited
you
he will say
to you
Friend
come up
higher
Then
will be
to you
glory
221683	before
221685	all
those
reclining
[with] you
For
221691	everyone
-
exalting
himself
will be humbled
and
the [one]
humbling
himself
will be exalted
He was saying
then
221704	also
to the [one]
having invited
Him
When
you make
a dinner
or
a supper
not
call
221716	-
221718	friends
of you
nor
221722	the
221724	brothers
of you
nor
221728	the
221730	relatives
of you
nor
221734	neighbors
rich
lest
ever
221739	also
they
should invite in return
you
and
be made
recompense
to you
But
when
a feast
you make
call
the poor
the crippled
the lame
the blind
and
blessed
you will be
because
nothing
they have
to repay
you
It will be recompensed
for
to you
221768	in
221770	the
221772	resurrection
221774	of the
righteous
Having heard
then
221779	one
of those
reclining with [Him]
these things
he said
to Him
Blessed [is he]
who
will eat
bread
221790	in
221792	the
221794	kingdom
221796	-
of God
-
But
He said
to him
221803	A man
certain
was preparing
221807	a supper
great
and
invited
many
And
he sent
221815	the
221817	servant
of him
221820	at the
221822	hour
221824	of the
supper
to say
to those
having been invited
Come
for
now
ready
[it] is
And
began
221837	with
one [voice]
all
to excuse themselves
221842	The
first
said
to him
A field
I have bought
and
I have
need
going out
to see
it
I beg of
you
hold
me
excused
And
another
said
221864	Yoke
of oxen
I have bought
five
and
I am going
to prove
them
I beg of
you
hold
me
excused
And
another
said
A wife
I have married
and
221884	because of
this
not
I am able
to come
And
having come
221892	the
servant
reported
221896	to the
221898	master
of him
these things
Then
having become angry
221904	the
master of the house
said
221908	to
221910	servant
of him
Go out
quickly
221915	into
221917	the
221919	streets
and
lanes
221923	of the
city
and
221927	the
poor
and
crippled
and
blind
and
lame
bring in
here
And
said
221940	the
servant
Sir
it has been done
as
you did command
and
still
room
there is
And
said
221953	the
master
221956	to
221958	the
servant
Go out
221962	into
221964	the
highways
and
hedges
and
compel [them]
to come in
so that
may be filled
221974	of me
221976	the
house
I say
for
to you
that
221983	not one
221986	the
men
of those
-
having been invited
will taste
221993	of me
221995	the
supper
Were going with
then
Him
222001	crowds
great
and
having turned
He said
222007	to
them
If
anyone
comes
222013	to
Me
and
not
hates
222019	the
222021	father
of himself
and
222025	the
mother
and
222029	the
wife
and
222033	the
children
and
222037	the
brothers
and
222041	the
sisters
222044	yes
and
222047	even
222049	the
222051	life
of him
not
he is able
to be
222057	of Me
disciple
Whoever
not
carries
222063	the
222065	cross
of himself
and
comes
222070	after
Me
not
is able
to be
222076	My
disciple
222079	Which
for
222082	of
you
desiring
a tower
to build
not
first
having sat down
counts
222092	the
cost
whether
he has
222097	for
[its] completion
Thus
not
ever
he having laid
of it
a foundation
and
not
being able
to finish
222110	all
-
seeing [it]
may begin
him
to mock
saying
-
222119	This
222121	-
man
began
to build
and
not
was able
to finish
Or
222131	what
king
proceeding
222135	with another
king
to engage
222139	in
war
not
having sat down
first
will take counsel
whether
able
he is
222149	with
222151	ten
thousand
to meet
the [one]
222156	with
222158	twenty
thousand
coming
222162	against
him
If
now
not
still
of him
far off
being
an embassy
having sent
he asks
222175	-
222177	for
peace
So
therefore
222182	every one
222184	of
you
who
not
does give up
222190	all
222192	that
222194	he himself
possesses
not
is able
to be
222200	My
disciple
Good [is]
therefore
222205	the
salt
if
however
222210	even
222212	the
salt
becomes tasteless
222216	with
what
will it be seasoned
Neither
222221	for
soil
nor
222225	for
manure
fit
is it
out
they cast
it
The [one]
having
ears
to hear
let him hear
222238	Were
now
to Him
drawing near
222243	all
222245	the
tax collectors
and
222249	the
sinners
to hear
Him
And
were grumbling
222256	the
both
Pharisees
and
222261	the
scribes
saying
-
This [man]
sinners
receives
and
eats with
them
He spoke
then
222274	to
them
222278	the
parable
this
saying
222285	What
man
222288	of
you
having
222292	a hundred
sheep
and
having lost
222298	of
them
one
not
leaves
222304	the
ninety
nine
222308	in
222310	the
open field
and
goes
222315	after
the [one]
having been lost
until
he finds
it
And
having found [it]
he lays [it]
222325	on
222327	the
222329	shoulders
of him
rejoicing
And
having come
222335	to
222337	the
house
he calls together
222341	the
friends
and
222345	the
neighbors
saying
to them
Rejoice with
me
for
I have found
222354	the
222356	sheep
of me
the [one]
having been lost
I say
to you
that
in the same way
joy
222366	in
222368	-
heaven
there will be
222372	over
222374	one
222376	sinner
repenting
rather than
222380	over
222382	ninety
nine
righteous ones
who
no
222388	need
have
of repentance
Or
222394	what
woman
222397	drachmas
having
ten
if
she should lose
222403	drachma
one
not
lights
a lamp
and
sweeps
222411	the
house
and
seeks
carefully
222417	until
it
she finds
And
having found [it]
she calls together
222424	the
friends
and
neighbors
saying
Rejoice with
me
for
I have found
222434	the
drachma
that
I lost
Thus
I say
to you
there is
joy
222444	before
222446	the
222448	angels
222450	-
of God
222453	over
222455	one
222457	sinner
repenting
He said
then
222462	A man
certain
had
222466	two
sons
And
said
222471	the
222473	younger
of them
222476	to
[the] father
Father
give
to me
222482	the
222484	falling [to me]
222486	portion
222488	of the
property
-
And
he divided
between them
222495	the
property
And
222499	after
222502	not
many
days
having gathered together
all
222508	the
222510	younger
son
went away
222514	into
222516	a country
distant
and
there
he wasted
222522	the
222524	estate
of him
living
prodigally
Having spent
however
of him
all
there arose
222534	a famine
severe
222537	throughout
222539	the
222541	country
that
and
he
began
to be in need
And
having gone
he joined himself
222551	to one
222553	of the
222555	citizens
222558	the
country
of that
and
he sent
him
222565	into
222567	the
222569	fields
of him
to feed
pigs
And
he was longing
to fill
222577	the
222579	belly
of him
222582	from
222584	the
pods
that
were eating
222589	the
pigs
and
no one
was giving
to him
222596	To
himself
however
having come
he was saying
222602	How many
222604	hired servants
222606	of the
222608	father
of me
have abundance
of bread
I
however
with hunger
here
am perishing
Having risen up
I will go
222620	to
222622	the
222624	father
of me
and
I will say
to him
Father
I have sinned
222632	against
222634	-
heaven
and
222638	before
you
no longer
am I
worthy
to be called
222645	son
of you
Make
me
like
222651	one
222653	of the
222655	servants
of you
And
having risen up
he went
222661	to
222663	the
222665	father
of himself
Still
now
he
far
being distant
saw
him
222675	the
222677	father
of him
and
was moved with compassion
and
having run
fell
222685	upon
222687	the
222689	neck
of him
and
kissed
him
Said
then
222697	the
son
to him
Father
I have sinned
222703	against
222705	-
heaven
and
222709	before
you
no longer
am I
worthy
to be called
222716	son
of you
Said
then
222721	the
father
222724	to
222726	the
222728	servants
of him
Quickly
bring out
222733	robe
222735	the
best
and
clothe
him
and
give
a ring
222744	for
222746	the
222748	hand
of him
and
sandals
222753	for
222755	his
feet
and
having brought
222760	the
222762	calf
222764	-
fattened
kill [it]
and
having eaten
let us be merry
For
222772	this
222774	-
222776	son
of mine
dead
was
and
is alive again
222783	he was
lost
and
is found
And
they began
to be merry
Was
now
222793	the
222796	son
of him
222799	the
elder
222802	in
[the] field
and
while
coming [up]
he drew near
222809	to the
house
he heard
music
and
dancing
And
having called near
222818	one
222820	of the
servants
he began inquiring
what
-
might be
these things
-
And
he said
to him
-
222833	The
222835	brother
of you
is come
and
has killed
222841	the
222843	father
of you
222846	the
222848	calf
222850	-
fattened
because
in good health
him
he has received
He was angry
however
and
not
was willing
to go in
222863	-
And
222866	the father
of him
having gone
was begging
him
-
And
answering
he said
222876	to
[the] father
Behold
222880	so many
years
I serve
you
and
never
222887	a commandment
of you
I disobeyed
and
to me
never
did you give
a young goat
that
222897	with
222899	the
222901	friends
of me
I might make merry
When
however
222908	the
222910	son
of you
this
the [one]
having devoured
222916	your
222918	-
living
222921	with
prostitutes
came
you have killed
for him
222927	the
222929	fattened
calf
-
And
he said
to him
Son
you
always
222939	with
me
are
and
222944	all
222946	that
[is] mine
yours
is
To make merry
however
and
to rejoice
it was fitting
because
222958	the
222960	brother
of you
this
dead
was
and
is alive again
and
he was lost
and
is found
He was saying
now
222974	also
222976	to
222978	the
disciples
222981	A man
certain
there was
rich
who
had
a manager
and
he
was accused
unto him
as
is wasting
222995	the
possessions
of him
And
having called
him
he said
to him
What [is]
this
I hear
223007	concerning
you
Give
223011	the
223013	account
223015	of the
223017	stewardship
of you
not
for
you are able
any longer
to manage
Said
then
223027	within
himself
223030	the
manager
What
shall I do
for
223036	the
223038	master
of me
is taking away
223042	the
management
223045	from
me
To dig
not
I am able
to beg
I am ashamed
I know
what
I will do
so that
when
I shall have been removed
223059	from
223061	the
management
they might receive
me
223066	into
223068	the
223070	homes
of them
And
having called to [him]
223076	one
each
223079	of the
223081	debtors
223083	of the
223085	master
of him
he was saying
223089	to the
first
How much
owe you
223094	to
223096	master
of me
-
And
he said
223102	A hundred
223104	baths
of oil
-
And
he said
to him
Take
223112	your
223114	the
bill
and
having sat down
quickly
write
fifty
Then
to another
he said
You
now
how much
owe
-
And
he said
223132	A hundred
223134	cors
of wheat
He says
to him
Take
223140	your
223142	-
bill
and
write
eighty
And
praised
223150	the
master
223153	the
223155	manager
223157	-
unrighteous
because
shrewdly
he had acted
For
223164	the
223166	sons
223169	of the
age
this
more shrewd
223174	than
223176	the
223178	sons
223180	of the
light
223183	in
223185	the
generation
223188	-
of themselves
are
And
I
to you
say
for yourselves
make
friends
223199	by
223201	the
223203	wealth
223205	-
of unrighteousness
that
when
it fails
they might receive
you
223213	into
223215	the
223217	eternal
dwellings
223220	The [one]
223222	faithful
223224	with
very little
223227	also
223229	with
much
faithful
is
and
223235	the [one]
223238	with
very little
unrighteous
223242	also
223244	with
much
unrighteous
is
If
therefore
223251	in
223253	the
223255	unrighteous
wealth
faithful
not
you have been
223261	the
true [riches]
who
to you
will entrust
And
if
223269	in
223271	that which [is]
of another
faithful
not
you have been
223277	that which
[is] yours
who
will give
to you
223283	No
servant
is able
223287	two
masters
to serve
either
for
223293	the
one
he will hate
and
223298	the
other
he will love
or
one
he will be devoted to
and
223306	the
other
he will despise
Not
you are able
God
to serve
and
money
Were listening to
now
223318	these things
all
223321	the
Pharisees
lovers of money
being
and
they were ridiculing
Him
And
He said
to them
You
are
those
justifying
themselves
223337	before
223339	-
men
223342	-
but
God
knows
223347	the
223349	hearts
of you
for
223353	that which
223356	among
men
[is] exalted
[is] an abomination
223361	before
223363	-
God
223366	The
law
and
223370	the
prophets [were]
223373	until
John
223376	from
that time
223379	the
223381	kingdom
223383	-
of God
is proclaimed
and
everyone
223389	into
it
forces his way
Easier for
however
it is
223396	the
heaven
and
223400	the
earth
to pass away
than
223406	of the
law
223409	one
stroke of a pen
to fail
223413	Everyone
-
putting away
223417	the
223419	wife
of him
and
marrying
another
commits adultery
And
the [one]
her put away
223429	from
a husband
marrying
commits adultery
223434	A man
now
certain
there was
rich
and
he was clothed in
purple
and
fine linen
making good cheer
223446	every
day
in splendor
223451	A poor man
now
certain
named
Lazarus
was laid
223458	at
223460	the
223462	gate
of him
being full of sores
and
desiring
to be fed
223469	from
that
falling
223473	from
223475	the
223477	table
223479	of the
rich man
but
223483	even
223485	the
dogs
coming
were licking
223490	the
223492	sores
of him
It came to pass that
then
died
223498	the
poor man
and
was carried away
he
223504	by
223506	the
angels
223509	into
223511	the
223513	bosom
of Abraham
Died
then
223518	also
223520	the
rich man
and
was buried
And
223526	in
223528	-
Hades
having lifted up
223532	the
223534	eyes
of him
being
223538	in
torment
he sees
Abraham
223543	from
afar
and
223547	Lazarus
223549	in
223551	the
223553	bosom
of him
And
he
having cried out
said
Father
Abraham
have mercy on
me
and
send
Lazarus
that
he might dip
223569	the
223571	tip
223573	of the
223575	finger
of him
in water
and
cool
223581	the
223583	tongue
of me
for
I am suffering
223588	in
223591	the
flame
this
Said
then
Abraham
Child
remember
that
you did fully receive
223602	the [things]
223604	good
of you
223607	in
223609	the
223611	lifetime
of you
and
Lazarus
likewise
223617	the [things]
evil
Now
however
here
he is comforted
you
now
are suffering
And
223628	besides
223630	all
these things
223633	between
us
and
you
223638	a chasm
great
has been fixed
so that
those
desiring
to pass
from here
223647	to
you
not
are able
nor
from there
223654	to
us
can they pass
He said
then
I implore
you
then
father
that
you would send
him
223667	to
223669	the
223671	house
223673	of the
223675	father
of me
I have
for
223680	five
brothers
so that
he might warn
them
that
not
223688	also
they
might come
223692	to
223696	the
place
this
223700	-
of torment
Says
however
Abraham
They have
Moses
and
223709	the
prophets
let them hear
them
-
And
he said
No
father
Abraham
but
if
one
223723	from
[the] dead
should go
223727	to
them
they will repent
He said
however
to him
If
Moses
and
223737	the
prophets
not
they hear
not even
if
one
223745	out from
[the] dead
should rise
will they be persuaded
He said
then
223752	to
223754	the
223756	disciples
of Him
Impossible
it is
for
223762	the
stumbling blocks
not
to come
woe [to him]
but
223769	by
whom
they come
It is better
for him
if
223776	a stone
of a mill
is hung
223780	around
223782	the
223784	neck
of him
and
he is thrown
223789	into
223791	the
sea
than
that
he should cause to stumble
223799	-
little
of these
one
Take heed
to yourselves
If
should sin
223808	the
223810	brother
of you
rebuke
him
and
if
he should repent
forgive
him
And
if
seven times
223823	in the
day
he should sin
223827	against
you
and
seven times
should return
223833	to
you
saying
I repent
you shall forgive
him
And
said
223842	the
apostles
223845	to the
Lord
Add
to us
faith
Said
then
223853	the
Lord
If
you have
223858	faith
223860	like
223862	a grain
of mustard
you would have said
-
223868	to the
mulberry tree
this
Be uprooted
and
be planted
223875	in
223877	the
sea
and
it would have obeyed
-
you
223885	Which
now
223888	of
you
223891	a servant
having
plowing
or
shepherding
the [one]
having come in
223899	out of
223901	the
field
will say
to him
Immediately
having come
recline
But
not
will he say
to him
Prepare
what
I may eat
and
having girded yourself about
serve
me
while
I eat
and
drink
and
223925	after
these things
shall eat
and
drink
you
Not
is he
thankful
223935	to the
servant
because
he did
the things
having been commanded
Thus
223943	also
you
when
you may have done
223948	all
the [things]
having been commanded
you
say
-
223955	Servants
unworthy
are we
that which
we were bound
to do
we have done
And
it came to pass
223965	in
the
going up
223969	to
Jerusalem
that
He
was passing
223975	through
223977	[the] midst
of Samaria
and
Galilee
And
on entering
of Him
223985	into
223987	a certain
village
met
223991	ten
223993	leprous
men
who
stood
afar off
And
they
lifted up
[their] voice
saying
Jesus
Master
have compassion on
us
And
having seen [them]
He said
to them
Having gone
show
yourselves
224015	to the
priests
And
it came to pass
224020	in
the
going
them
they were cleansed
224026	One
then
224029	of
them
having seen
that
he was healed
turned back
224036	with
224038	a voice
loud
glorifying
224042	-
God
and
he fell
224047	on
[his] face
224050	at
224052	the
224054	feet
of Him
giving thanks
to Him
and
he
was
a Samaritan
Having answered
then
224065	-
Jesus
said
Not
224070	the
ten
were cleansed
224074	-
But
the nine
are where
None
was there found
having returned
to give
glory
224084	-
to God
if
not
224090	the
foreigner
this
And
He said
to him
Having risen up
go forth
224099	the
224101	faith
of you
has cured
you
Having been asked
now
224108	by
224110	the
Pharisees
when
is coming
224115	the
224117	kingdom
224119	-
of God
He answered
them
and
said
Not
comes
224128	the
224130	kingdom
224132	-
of God
224135	with
careful observation
nor
will they say
Behold
here
or
There
Behold
for
224146	the
224148	kingdom
224150	-
of God
224153	in the midst
of you
is
He said
then
224159	to
224161	the
disciples
Will come
days
when
you will desire
224168	one
224170	of the
224172	days
224174	of the
224176	Son
224178	-
of Man
to see
and
not
you will see [it]
And
they will say
to you
Behold
there
Behold
here
Not
go forth
nor
follow
As
for
224198	the
lightning
flashing
224202	from
224204	the [one end]
224206	of
224208	the
sky
224211	to
224213	the [other end]
224215	of the
sky
shines
thus
will be
224221	the
224223	Son
224225	-
of Man
224228	in
224230	the
224232	day
of Him
First
however
it behooves
Him
many things
to suffer
and
to be rejected
224243	by
224246	the
generation
this
And
as
it came to pass
224253	in
224255	the
224257	days
of Noah
thus
will it be
224262	also
224264	in
224266	the
224268	days
224270	of the
224272	Son
224274	of
man
They were eating
they were drinking
they were marrying
they were being given in marriage
224281	until
224283	that
day
entered
Noah
224288	into
224290	the
ark
and
came
224295	the
flood
and
destroyed
all
Likewise
as
it came to pass
224304	in
224306	the
224308	days
of Lot
they were eating
they were drinking
they were buying
they were selling
they were planting
they were building
224317	in that
then
day
went out
Lot
224323	from
Sodom
it rained
fire
and
brimstone
224330	from
heaven
and
destroyed
all
224336	According
224338	-
to these
will it be
224342	in that
day
224345	the
224347	Son
224349	-
of Man
is revealed
224353	In
224355	that
224357	-
day
the [one who]
will be
224362	on
224364	the
housetop
and
224368	the
224370	goods
of him
224373	in
224375	the
house
not
let him come down
to take away
them
and
224383	the [one]
224385	in
[the] field
likewise
not
let him return
224391	to
224393	the things
behind
Remember
224397	the
224399	wife
of Lot
Whoever
if
may seek
224405	the
224407	life
of him
to save
will lose
it
also
whoever
-
will lose [it]
will preserve
it
I say
to you
224421	in that
224423	-
night
there will be
two
224428	upon
224430	bed
one
224433	The
one
will be taken
and
224438	the
other
will be left
224442	There will be
two [women]
grinding
224446	at
224448	the
same [place]
224451	The
one
will be taken
224455	-
and
the other
will be left
And
answering
they say
to Him
Where
Lord
-
And
He said
to them
Where
224471	the
body [is]
there
224475	also
224477	the
vultures
will be gathered together
He was speaking
then
a parable
to them
224485	about
the [way]
it behooves
always
to pray
them
and
not
to lose heart
saying
224496	A judge
certain
there was
224500	in
224502	a certain
city
224505	-
God
not
fearing
and
man
not
respecting
A widow
then
there was
224517	in
224520	the
city
that
and
she was coming
224526	to
him
saying
Avenge
me
224532	of
224534	the
224536	adversary
of me
And
not
he would
224542	for
a time
224545	afterward
he
however
said
224550	within
himself
If
224554	even
224556	-
God
not
I fear
nor
man
respect
224564	because
yet
-
causes
me
trouble
224572	the
widow
this
I will avenge
her
so that
not
224580	to
end
coming
she exhaust
me
Said
then
224588	the
Lord
Hear
what
224593	the
224595	judge
224597	-
unrighteous
says
224601	-
And
God
no
not
shall execute
224608	the
224610	avenging
224612	of the
224614	elect
of Him
the [ones]
crying out
to Him
day
and
night
and
be deferring
224625	in regard to
them
I say
to you
that
He will execute
224632	the
224634	avenging
of them
224637	in
quickness
Nevertheless
224641	the
224643	Son
224645	-
of Man
having come
indeed
will He find
224651	-
faith
224654	on
224656	the
earth
He spoke
now
224661	also
224663	to
224665	some
-
trusting
224669	in
themselves
that
they are
righteous
and
despising
224677	the
others
224681	the
parable
this
224685	Men
two
went up
224689	into
224691	the
temple
to pray
224695	the
one
a Pharisee
and
224700	the
other
a tax collector
224704	The
Pharisee
having stood
thus
224709	toward
himself
was praying
224713	-
God
I thank
You
that
not
I am
like
224722	the
224724	rest
224726	of the
men
swindlers
unrighteous
adulterers
or
224733	even
like
224736	this
224738	-
tax collector
I fast
twice
224743	in the
week
I tithe
224747	all things
as many as
I gain
224751	-
But
the tax collector
afar off
standing
not
was willing
not even
224760	the
eyes
to lift up
224764	to
224766	-
heaven
but
was striking
224771	the
224773	breast
of himself
saying
224777	-
God
be merciful
to me
224782	the
sinner
I say
to you
went down
this one
justified
224790	to
224792	the
224794	house
of him
224797	rather than
that
For
224801	everyone
-
exalting
himself
will be humbled
the [one]
however
humbling
himself
will be exalted
They were bringing
then
to Him
224815	also
224817	the
infants
that
them
He might touch
having seen
however
224825	the
disciples
were rebuking
them
224830	-
But
Jesus
having called to [Him]
them
said
Permit
224838	the
little children
to come
224842	to
Me
and
not
do forbid
them
224849	of the
for
such
is
224854	the
224856	kingdom
224858	-
of God
Truly
I say
to you
whoever
-
not
shall receive
224868	the
224870	kingdom
224872	-
of God
as
a child
224877	no
not
shall enter
224881	into
it
And
asked
224886	a certain
Him
ruler
saying
224891	Teacher
good
what
having done
224896	life
eternal
will I inherit
Said
then
to him
224903	-
Jesus
Why
Me
call you
good
No one [is]
good
if
not
alone
224915	-
God
224918	The
commandments
You know
Not
shall you commit adultery
not
shall you murder
not
shall you steal
not
shall you bear false witness
you shall honor
224931	the
224933	father
of you
and
224937	the
mother
-
And
he said
224943	These
all
have I kept
224947	from
[the] youth
Having heard
then
224952	-
Jesus
said
to him
Yet
one thing
to you
is lacking
224961	All
as much as
you have
sell
and
distribute
to [the] poor
and
you will have
treasure
224972	in
224974	the
heavens
and
come
follow
Me
-
And
having heard
these things
very sorrowful
he became
he was
for
rich
extremely
Having seen
then
him
224994	-
Jesus
saying
224998	How
difficultly
those
225002	-
riches
having
225006	into
225008	the
225010	kingdom
225012	-
of God
shall enter
Easier
for
it is
a camel
225020	through
225022	an eye
of a needle
to go
than
a rich man
225028	into
225030	the
225032	kingdom
225034	-
of God
to enter
Said
then
those
having heard
Then
who
is able
to be saved
-
But
He said
225050	The things
impossible
225053	with
men
possible
225057	with
225059	-
God
are
Said
then
225065	-
Peter
Behold
we
having left
225071	the
own
followed
You
-
And
He said
to them
Truly
I say
to you
that
no one
there is
who
has left
house
or
wife
or
brothers
or
parents
or
children
225097	for the sake of
225099	the
225101	kingdom
225103	-
of God
who
no
nothing
shall receive
manifold more
225111	in
225114	the
time
this
and
225119	in
225121	the
age
that
is coming
225126	life
eternal
Having taken aside
then
225131	the
Twelve
He said
225135	to
them
Behold
we go up
225140	to
Jerusalem
and
will be accomplished
225145	all things
-
having been written
225149	by
225151	the
prophets
225154	about the
225156	Son
225158	-
of Man
He will be betrayed
for
225163	to the
Gentiles
and
will be mocked
and
will be insulted
and
will be spit upon
And
having flogged [Him]
they will kill
Him
and
225177	on the
225179	day
225181	-
third
He will rise again
And
they
225187	none
of these things
understood
and
was
225194	the
word
this
hidden
225199	from
them
and
neither
they knew
the things
being spoken
It came to pass
then
225209	in
the
drawing near
of Him
225214	to
Jericho
225217	a blind [man]
certain
was sitting
225221	beside
225223	the
road
begging
Having heard
now
a crowd
passing along
he was asking
what
might be
this
They told
then
him
-
Jesus
225240	of
Nazareth
is passing by
And
he called out
saying
Jesus
225248	Son
of David
have mercy on
me
And
those
going before
were rebuking
him
that
he should be silent
He
however
225262	much
more
kept crying out
225266	Son
of David
have mercy on
me
Having stopped
then
225273	-
Jesus
commanded
him
to be brought
225279	to
Him
Having drawn near
then
him
He asked
him
What
to you
desire you
I shall do
-
And
he said
Lord
that
I might receive sight
And
225298	-
Jesus
said
to him
Receive sight
225304	The
225306	faith
of you
has healed
you
And
immediately
he received sight
and
began following
Him
glorifying
225318	-
God
And
225322	all
225324	the
people
having seen [it]
gave
praise
225330	-
to God
And
having entered
He was passing through
225336	-
Jericho
And
behold
225341	a man
by name
called
Zacchaeus
and
he
was
a chief tax collector
and
he [was]
rich
And
he was seeking
to see
225356	-
Jesus
who
He is
and
not
he was able
225364	because of
225366	the
crowd
because
225370	-
in stature
small
he was
And
having run
225377	to
225379	the
front
he went up
225383	into
a sycamore-fig tree
so that
he might see
Him
for
that [way]
He was about
to pass
And
as
He came
225396	to
225398	the
place
having looked up
225402	-
Jesus
said
225406	to
him
Zacchaeus
having hurried
come down
today
for
225414	in
225416	the
225418	house
of you
it behooves
Me
to stay
And
having hurried
he came down
and
received
Him
rejoicing
And
having seen [it]
all
were grumbling
saying
-
225437	With
225439	a sinful
man
He has entered
to stay
Having stood
then
Zacchaeus
said
225448	to
225450	the
Lord
Behold
225454	the
225456	half
225458	of me
of the
possessions
Lord
225463	to the
poor
I give
and
if
of anyone
anything
I have defrauded
I restore [it]
fourfold
Said
then
225476	to
him
225479	-
Jesus
-
Today
salvation
225486	to the
house
this
has come
because
225492	also
he
225495	a son
of Abraham
is
Came
for
225501	the
225503	Son
225505	-
of Man
to seek
and
to save
that
having been lost
Were hearing
while
they
these things
having proceeded
He spoke
a parable
225520	because
-
225523	near
being
Jerusalem
of His
and
thinking
their
that
immediately
is about
225534	the
225536	kingdom
225538	-
of God
to appear
He said
therefore
225545	A man
certain
of noble birth
proceeded
225550	to
225552	a country
distant
to receive
for himself
a kingdom
and
to return
Having called
then
225562	ten
225564	servants
of himself
he gave
to them
225569	ten
minas
and
said
225574	to
them
Do business
225578	until
that
I come back
225582	-
But
225585	the citizens
of him
hated
him
and
sent
a delegation
225593	after
him
saying
Not
we are willing [for]
this [man]
to reign
225601	over
us
And
it came to pass
225606	on
the
returning
of him
having received
225612	the
kingdom
that
he directed
to be called
to him
225620	the
servants
these
to whom
he had given
225626	the
money
in order that
he might know
each
what
had gained by trading
Came up
then
225636	the
first
saying
Lord
225641	the
225643	mina
of you
225646	ten
has produced
more minas
And
He said
to him
Well done
225654	good
servant
Because
225658	in
very little
faithful
you were
to be
having authority
you are
225666	over
225668	ten
cities
And
came
225673	the
second
saying
225677	The
225679	mina
of you
Lord
has made
225684	five
minas
He said
then
225689	also
to this one
225692	And
you
225695	over
are to be
225698	five
cities
And
225702	-
another
came
saying
Lord
behold
225709	the
225711	mina
of you
which
I kept
lying away
225717	in
a piece of cloth
I was afraid
for
of you
because
225724	a man
harsh
you are
You take up
what
not
you did lay down
and
you reap
what
not
you did sow
He says
to him
225739	Out of
225741	the
225743	mouth
of you
I will judge
you
225748	evil
servant
You knew
that
I
225755	a man
harsh
am
taking up
what
not
I did lay down
and
reaping
what
not
I did sow
Then
225769	because of
why
not
did you give
225774	of me
225776	the
money
225779	to
[the] bank
and I
having come
225784	with
interest
-
it
might have collected
And
to those
standing by
he said
Take
225795	from
him
225798	the
mina
and
give [it]
to the [one]
225804	the
225806	ten
minas
having
And
they said
to him
Master
he has
225815	ten
minas
I say
to you
that
225821	to everyone
-
having
will be given
225826	from
however
the [one]
not
having
225832	even
that which
he has
will be taken away
Furthermore
225839	the
225841	enemies
of mine
these
those
not
having been willing [for]
me
to reign
225850	over
them
bring
here
and
slay
them
225858	before
me
And
having said
these things
He went on
ahead
going up
225867	to
Jerusalem
And
it came to pass
as
He drew near
225874	to
Bethphage
and
Bethany
225879	toward
225881	the
mount
-
called
Olivet
He sent
225888	two
225890	of the
disciples
saying
Go
225895	into
225897	the
225899	ahead
village
225902	in
which
entering
you will find
a colt
having been tied
225909	on
which
225912	no one
ever yet
of men
has sat
and
having untied
it
bring [it]
And
if
anyone
you
asks
225926	Because of
why
do you untie [it]
thus
will you say
Because
225933	the
Lord
225936	of it
need
has
Having departed
then
those
having been sent
found [it]
as
He had said
to them
On untying
then
of them
225951	the
colt
said
225955	the
225957	masters
of it
225960	to
them
Why
untie you
225965	the
colt
-
And
they said
-
225972	The
Lord
225975	of it
need
has
And
they led
it
225982	to
225984	-
Jesus
and
having cast
225989	their
225991	-
garments
225994	on
225996	the
colt
they put on [it]
226000	-
Jesus
Going
then
of Him
they were spreading
226007	the
226009	garments
of them
226012	on
226014	the
road
Drawing near
then
of Him
already
226021	at
226023	the
226025	descent
226027	of the
226029	Mount
226031	-
of Olives
began
226035	all
226037	the
226039	multitude
226041	of the
disciples
rejoicing
to praise
226046	-
God
226049	in a voice
loud
226052	for
226054	all
which
they had seen
[the] mighty works
saying
Blessed is
the
coming
226063	-
King
226066	in
226068	[the] name
of [the] Lord
226071	In
heaven
peace
and
glory
226077	in
[the] highest
And
226082	some
226084	of the
Pharisees
226087	from
226089	the
crowd
said
226093	to
Him
Teacher
rebuke
226098	the
226100	disciples
of You
And
answering
He said
I say
to you
if
these
will be silent
226111	the
stones
will cry out
And
as
He drew near
having seen
226119	the
city
He wept
226123	over
it
saying
-
If
you had known
226130	in
226133	the
day
this
226137	even
you
226140	the things
226142	for
peace
Now
however
they are hidden
226148	from
226150	eyes
of you
For
will come
days
226156	upon
you
that
will cast around
226161	the
226163	enemies
of you
a barricade
you
and
they will surround
you
and
will hem in
you
on every side
and
will level to the ground
you
and
226179	the
226182	children
of you
226185	within
you
and
not
will leave
a stone
226192	upon
a stone
226195	within
you
226198	in place of
which
not
you knew
226203	the
226205	season
226207	the
226209	of visitation
of you
And
having entered
226214	into
226216	the
temple
He began
to cast out
those
selling
saying
to them
It has been written
And
will be
226228	the
226230	house
of Me
226233	a house
of prayer
You
however
it
have made
226240	a den
of robbers
And
226244	He was
teaching
226247	-
226249	every
day
226252	in
226254	the
temple
226257	the
however
chief priests
and
226262	the
scribes
were seeking
Him
to destroy
and
226269	the
226271	foremost
226273	of the
people
And
not
they found
-
what
they might do
226283	the
people
for
all
were hanging on
His [words]
listening
And
it came to pass
226293	on
226295	one
226297	of the
days
as was teaching
He
226302	the
people
226305	in
226307	the
temple
and
proclaiming the gospel
came up
226313	the
chief priests
and
226317	the
scribes
226320	with
226322	the
elders
and
spoke
saying
226328	to
Him
Tell
us
226333	by
226335	what
authority
these things
You do
or
who
is
the [one]
having given
to You
226347	the
authority
this
Answering
now
He said
226354	to
them
Will ask
you
I also
one thing
and
you tell
Me
226364	The
226366	baptism
of John
226369	from
heaven
was it
or
226374	from
men
-
And
they reasoned
226380	among
themselves
saying
-
If
we should say
226387	From
heaven
He will say
226391	Because of
why
not
did you believe
him
If
however
we should say
226400	From
men
226404	the
people
all
will stone
us
226410	having been persuaded
for
they are
John
a prophet
to be
And
they answered
not
they knew
from where
And
226423	-
Jesus
said
to them
Neither
I
tell
you
226432	by
226434	what
authority
these things
I am doing
He began
then
226441	to
226443	the
people
to speak
226448	the
parable
this
A man
planted
a vineyard
and
rented
it
to farmers
and
went abroad
226461	a time
long
And
[in the] season
he sent
226467	to
226469	the
farmers
a servant
that
226474	from
226476	the
226478	fruit
226480	of the
vineyard
they will give
to him
226485	-
But
the farmers
sent away
him
having beaten [him]
empty-handed
And
he proceeded
226495	another
to send
a servant
-
but
him
having beaten
and
having dishonored
they sent away
empty-handed
And
he proceeded
a third
to send
-
then
226513	also
him
having wounded
they cast out
Said
then
226520	the
226522	master
226524	of the
vineyard
What
shall I do
I will send
226530	the
226532	son
of me
226535	the
beloved
perhaps
him
they will respect
Having seen
now
him
226544	the
farmers
began reasoning
226548	among
themselves
saying
This
is
226554	the
heir
let us kill
him
so that
ours
might become
226562	the
inheritance
And
having cast forth
him
226568	outside
226570	the
vineyard
they killed [him]
What
therefore
will do
to them
226578	the
226580	master
226582	of the
vineyard
He will come
and
will destroy
226589	the
farmers
these
and
will give
226595	the
vineyard
to others
Having heard [it]
then
they said
Never
may it be
-
But
having looked at
them
He said
What
then
is
226612	that
has been written
this
[The] stone
which
rejected
those
building
this
has become
226623	into
226625	[the] head
of [the] corner
226628	Everyone
-
falling
226632	on
226634	that
226636	-
stone
will be broken
226640	on
whomever
but
-
it might fall
it will grind into powder
him
And
sought
226650	the
scribes
and
226654	the
chief priests
to lay
226658	on
Him
226661	-
hands
226664	in
226666	that
226668	-
hour
and
they feared
226673	the
people
they perceived
for
that
226679	against
them
He was speaking
226684	the
parable
this
And
having watched [Him]
they sent
226691	spies
feigning
themselves
righteous
to be
that
they might catch
226699	Him
in talk
in order
to deliver
Him
226705	to the
rule
and
226709	to the
226711	authority
226713	of the
governor
And
they questioned
Him
saying
Teacher
we know
that
rightly
You speak
and
teach
and
not
receive
[any] person
but
226732	on the basis of
truth
226735	the
226737	way
226739	-
of God
teach
Is it lawful
for us
to Caesar
tribute
to give
or
not
Having perceived
however
226752	of them
226754	the
craftiness
He said
226758	to
them
Show
Me
a denarius
226764	Of whom
has it
[the] image
and
inscription
-
And
they said
Caesarâs
-
And
He said
226777	to
them
Therefore
give back
226782	the things
of Caesar
to Caesar
and
226787	the things
226789	-
of God
226792	-
to God
And
not
they were able
to catch Him in
226799	His
word
226802	before
226804	the
people
and
having marveled
226809	at
226811	the
226813	answer
of Him
they became silent
Having approached
then
226819	some
226821	of the
Sadducees
the ones
denying
a resurrection
not
there is
they questioned
Him
saying
Teacher
Moses
wrote
to us
if
226837	anyoneâs
brother
should die
having
a wife
and
he
childless
is
that
should take
226849	the
226851	brother
of him
226854	the
wife
and
should raise up
seed
226860	to the
226862	brother
of him
226865	Seven
therefore
brothers
there were
and
226871	the
first
having taken
a wife
died
childless
and
226879	the
second
and
226883	the
third
took
her
likewise
then
226890	also
226892	the
seven
not
did leave
children
and
died
Finally
226901	also
226903	the
woman
died
226907	The
woman
therefore
226911	in
226913	the
resurrection
226917	of which
of them
does she become
wife
226922	-
For
the seven
had
her
as wife
And
said
to them
226932	-
Jesus
226935	The
226937	sons
226940	of the
age
this
marry
and
are given in marriage
those
however
having been considered worthy
226951	to the
age
that which [is]
to obtain
and
226957	the
resurrection
226960	which [is]
226962	out from
[the] dead
neither
marry
nor
are given in marriage
neither
for
to die
any more
are they able
like [the] angels
for
they are
and
226978	sons
they are
of God
226983	of the
resurrection
sons
being
That
however
are raised
226991	the
dead
226994	even
Moses
showed
226998	at
227000	the
bush
when
he calls
[the] Lord
227006	the
227008	God
of Abraham
and
227012	God
of Isaac
and
227016	God
of Jacob
God
now
not
He is
of [the] dead
but
of [the] living
all
for
to Him
live
Answering
now
227032	some
227034	of the
scribes
said
Teacher
well
you have spoken
No longer
then
did they dare
to ask
Him
anything
He said
then
227049	to
them
How
do they declare
227054	the
Christ
to be
227058	of David
Son
227061	Himself
for
David
says
227066	in
227068	[the] book
of Psalms
Said
[the] Lord
227073	to the
227075	Lord
of me
Sit
227079	at
227081	[the] right hand
of Me
until
-
I place
227087	the
227089	enemies
of You
227092	[as] a footstool
227094	of the
227096	feet
of You
David
therefore
Him
Lord
calls
and
how
227106	of him
son
is He
Were listening
now
227112	all
227114	the
people
He said
227118	to the
disciples
Beware
227122	of
227124	the
scribes
-
desiring
to walk
227130	in
long robes
and
loving
227135	greetings
227137	in
227139	the
marketplaces
and
227143	first seats
227145	in
227147	the
synagogues
and
227151	first places
227153	in
227155	the
banquets
who
devour
227160	the
227162	houses
227164	of
widows
and
as a pretext
at great length
pray
These
will receive
227173	more abundant
condemnation
Having looked up
now
He saw
227179	the ones
227181	casting
227183	into
227185	the
treasury
227188	the
227190	gifts
of them
rich
He saw
then
227196	a certain
227198	widow
poor
casting
in
227203	lepta
two
And
He said
Truly
I say
to you
that
227213	the
widow
this
227217	-
poor
227220	more
than all
has cast in
227224	all
for
these
227228	out of
that which
was abounding
to them
cast
227234	in
227236	the
gifts
she
however
227241	out of
227243	the
227245	poverty
of her
227248	all
227250	the
livelihood
that
she had
did cast
And
as some
were speaking
227259	about
227261	the
temple
that
227265	with stones
goodly
and
consecrated gifts
it was adorned
He said
[As to] these things
which
you are beholding
will come
[the] days
227277	in
which
not
will be left
stone
227283	upon
stone
which
not
will be thrown down
They asked
then
Him
saying
Teacher
when
then
these things
will be
and
what [will be]
227300	the
sign
when
are about
these things
to take place
-
And
He said
Take heed
lest
you be led astray
many
for
will come
227316	in
227318	the
227320	name
of Me
saying
I
am [He]
and
227327	The
time
is drawn near
Not
go
227333	after
them
When
then
you should hear of
wars
and
commotions
not
be terrified
it behooves
for
these things
to take place
first
but
not
immediately [is]
227352	the
end
Then
He was saying
to them
Will rise up
nation
227360	against
nation
and
kingdom
227365	against
kingdom
227368	Earthquakes
both
great
and
227374	in different
places
famines
and
pestilences
there will be
fearful sights
also
and
227385	from
heaven
227388	signs
great
will there be
227392	Before
however
227395	these things
all
they will lay
227399	upon
you
227402	the
227404	hands
of them
and
will persecute [you]
delivering [you]
227410	to
227412	the
synagogues
and
prisons
bringing [you]
227418	before
kings
and
governors
227423	on account of
227425	the
227427	name
of Me
It will result
to you
227432	for
a testimony
Settle
therefore
227437	in
227439	the
227441	minds
of you
not
to premeditate
to make a defense
I
for
will give
you
a mouth
and
wisdom
which
not
will be able
to resist
nor
to reply to
227460	all
those
opposing
you
You will be betrayed
then
227467	even
227469	by
parents
and
brothers
and
relatives
and
friends
and
they will put to death
227480	[some] from among
you
And
227484	you will be
hated
227487	by
all
227490	because of
227492	the
227494	name
of Me
But
a hair
227499	of
227501	the
227503	head
of you
227506	no
not
should perish
227510	By
227512	the
227514	patient endurance
of you
you will gain
227518	the
227520	souls
of you
When
then
you see
being encircled
227527	by
encampments
Jerusalem
then
know
that
has drawn near
227535	the
227537	desolation
of her
Then
227541	those
227543	in
227545	-
Judea
let them flee
227549	to
227551	the
mountains
and
227555	those
227557	in
227559	midst
of her
let them depart out
and
227564	those
227566	in
227568	the
countries
not
let them enter
227573	into
her
for
227577	[the] days
of avenging
these
are
-
to fulfill
227584	all things
-
having been written
But woe
to those
227590	in
womb
having
and
to the [ones]
nursing
227597	in
227599	those
227601	the
days
there will be
for
227606	distress
great
227609	upon
227611	the
land
and
wrath
227617	to the
people
this
And
they will fall
227623	by [the] edge
of [the] sword
and
will be led captive
227628	into
227631	the
nations
all
and
Jerusalem
227637	will be
trodden down
227640	by
[the] Gentiles
227643	until
that
are fulfilled
227647	[the] times
of [the] Gentiles
And
there will be
signs
227653	in
sun
and
moon
and
stars
and
227661	upon
227663	the
earth
227666	distress
of nations
227669	with
227671	perplexity
227673	[the] roaring
of [the] sea
and
rolling surge
fainting
men
227680	from
fear
and
227684	expectation
of that which
is coming
227688	on the
earth
227691	-
for
227694	the powers
227696	of the
heavens
will be shaken
And
then
will they see
227703	the
227705	Son
227707	-
of Man
coming
227711	in
a cloud
227714	with
227716	power
and
glory
great
Beginning
then
of these things
to come to pass
look up
and
lift up
227728	the
227730	heads
of you
because
draws near
227735	the
227737	redemption
of you
And
He spoke
a parable
to them
Behold
227745	the
fig tree
and
227749	all
227751	the
trees
When
they sprout
already
looking [on them]
227758	for
yourselves
you know
that
already
near
227765	the
summer
is
So
227770	also
you
when
you see
these things
coming to pass
know
that
near
is
227781	the
227783	kingdom
227785	-
of God
Truly
I say
to you
that
227792	no
not
will have passed away
227797	the
generation
this
until
-
all [these things]
shall have taken place
227805	The
heaven
and
227809	the
earth
will pass away
227813	-
but
227816	the words
of Me
227819	no
not
will pass away
Take heed
now
to yourselves
lest
ever
be burdened
227829	of you
227831	the
hearts
227834	with
dissipation
and
drunkenness
and
227840	cares
of life
and
would come
227845	upon
you
suddenly
227850	the
day
that
as
a snare
It will come
for
227858	upon
227860	all
those
sitting
227864	upon
227866	the face
227868	of all
227870	the
earth
Watch
also
227875	at
227877	every
season
praying
that
you may have strength
to escape
227884	these things
all
that
are about
to come to pass
and
to stand
227892	before
227894	the
227896	Son
227898	-
of Man
227901	He was
now
227904	during the
day
227907	in
227909	the
temple
teaching
227913	-
and
the evening
going out
He was lodging
227919	on
227921	the
mount
-
called
Olivet
And
227928	all
227930	the
people
would come early in the morning
227934	to
Him
227937	in
227939	the
temple
to hear
Him
Was drawing near
now
227946	the
227948	Feast
227950	of
Unleavened [Bread]
-
called
Passover
And
were seeking
227958	the
chief priests
and
227962	the
scribes
-
how
they might put to death
him
they were afraid
for
227971	of the
people
Entered
then
Satan
227977	into
227979	Judas
the [one]
being called
Iscariot
being
227985	of
227987	the
227989	number
227991	of the
Twelve
And
having gone away
he spoke with
227997	the
chief priests
and
captains
the
how
to them
he might betray
Him
And
they rejoiced
and
agreed
him
money
to give
And
he promised
and
began seeking
opportunity
-
to betray
Him
228022	apart from
[a] crowd
to them
Came
then
228028	the
228030	day
228032	of
Unleavened [Bread]
which
it was necessary for
to be sacrificed
228038	the
Passover lamb
And
He sent
Peter
and
John
having said
Having gone
prepare
for us
228050	the
Passover
that
we might eat [it]
-
And
they said
to Him
Where
will You
we should prepare
-
And
He said
to them
Behold
having entered
of you
228069	into
228071	the
city
will meet
you
228076	a man
228078	a pitcher
of water
carrying
follow
him
228084	into
228086	the
house
228089	into
which
he enters
and
you shall say
228095	to the
228097	master
228099	of the
house
Says
to you
228104	the
Teacher
Where
is
228109	the
guest room
where
228113	the
Passover
228116	with
228118	the
228120	disciples
of Me
I may eat
And he
you
will show
228128	an upper room
large
furnished
there
prepare
Having gone
then
they found [it]
as
He had said
to them
and
they prepared
228142	the
Passover
And
when
was come
228148	the
hour
He reclined
and
228153	the
apostles
228156	with
Him
And
He said
228161	to
them
With desire
I have desired
228166	this
228168	-
Passover
to eat
228172	with
you
228175	before
-
I
suffer
I say
for
to you
that
no longer
228185	never
not
will I eat
thereof
228190	until
when
it is fulfilled
228194	in
228196	the
228198	kingdom
228200	-
of God
And
having received
[the] cup
having given thanks
He said
Take
this
and
divide [it]
228212	among
yourselves
I say
for
to you
228218	no
not
will I drink
228222	from
228224	-
now
228227	of
228229	the
228231	fruit
228233	of the
vine
228236	until
that
228239	the
228241	kingdom
228243	-
of God
shall come
And
having taken
[the] bread
having given thanks
He broke [it]
and
gave
to them
saying
This
is
228258	the
228260	body
of Me
which
228264	for
you
is given
this
do
228270	in
228272	the
228274	of Me
remembrance
and
228278	the
cup
likewise
228282	after
which
having supped
saying
228287	This
228289	-
cup [is]
228292	the
228294	new
228296	covenant
228298	in
228300	the
228302	blood
of Me
which
228306	for
you
is being poured out
But
behold
228312	the
228314	hand
of him
betraying
Me
228319	[is] with
Me
228322	on
228324	the
table
For
228328	the
228330	Son
indeed
228333	of
man
228336	according to
that
having been determined
goes
but
woe
228344	to the
man
that
228348	by
whom
He is betrayed
And
they
began
to question
228356	among
themselves
-
who
then
it might be
228363	of
them
who
this
is about
to do
There was
then
228372	also
a dispute
228375	among
them
-
228379	which
of them
is thought
to be
[the] greatest
-
And
He said
to them
228389	The
228391	kings
228393	of the
Gentiles
rule over
them
and
those
exercising authority over
them
benefactors
are called
You
however
not
thus [shall be]
Instead
228409	the
228411	greatest
228413	among
you
let him be
228417	as
228419	the
younger
and
the [one]
leading
228425	as
the [one]
serving
Who
for
[is] greater
the [one]
reclining
or
the [one]
serving
[Is] not
the [one]
reclining
I
however
228442	in
228444	[the] midst
of you
am
228448	as
the [One]
serving
You
now
are
those
having remained
228457	with
Me
228460	in
228462	the
228464	trials
of Me
And I
appoint
to you
as
appointed
to Me
228473	the
228475	Father
of Me
a kingdom
so that
you may eat
and
may drink
228483	at
228485	the
228487	table
of Me
228490	in
228492	the
228494	kingdom
of Me
and
may sit
228499	on
thrones
228502	the
228504	twelve
228506	tribes
judging
228509	of
Israel
Simon
Simon
Behold
228515	-
Satan
demanded to have
all of you
-
to sift
like
228523	-
wheat
I
however
begged
228529	for
you
that
not
may fail
228535	the
228537	faith
of you
and
you
when
you have turned back
strengthen
228545	the
228547	brothers
of you
-
And
he said
to Him
Lord
228555	with
You
ready
I am
228560	both
228562	to
prison
and
228566	to
death
to go
-
And
He said
I tell
you
Peter
not
will crow
today
[the] rooster
until
three times
Me
you will deny
not
knowing
And
He said
to them
When
I sent
you
228592	without
purse
and
bag
and
sandals
not
anything
did you lack
-
And
they said
Nothing
He said
then
to them
But
now
the [one]
having
a purse
let him take [it]
likewise
228616	also
a bag
and
the [one]
not
having
let him sell
228624	the
228626	cloak
of him
and
buy [one]
a sword
I say
for
to you
that
228636	this
which
has been written
it behooves
to be accomplished
228642	in
Me
-
And
228647	with
the lawless
He was reckoned
228651	And
for
228654	the things
228656	concerning
Me
an end
have
-
And
they said
Lord
behold
swords
here [are]
two
-
And
He said
to them
Enough
it is
And
having gone forth
He went
228678	according to
228680	the
custom
228683	to
228685	the
228687	Mount
228689	-
of Olives
followed
then
Him
228695	also
228697	the
disciples
Having come
then
228702	to
228704	the
place
He said
to them
Pray
not
to enter
228712	into
temptation
And
He
withdrew
228718	from
them
228721	about
228723	a stoneâs
throw
and
having fallen on
228728	the
knees
He was praying
saying
Father
if
You are willing
take away
228737	this
228739	-
cup
228742	from
Me
Yet
not
228747	the
228749	will
of Me
but
228753	-
of You
be done
Appeared
then
to Him
an angel
228761	from
heaven
strengthening
Him
And
having been
228768	in
agony
more earnestly
He was praying
And
became
228775	the
228777	sweat
of Him
228780	like
228782	great drops
of blood
falling down
228786	upon
228788	the
ground
And
having risen up
228793	from
228795	the
prayer
having come
228799	to
228801	the
disciples
He found
sleeping
them
228807	from
228809	the
grief
and
He said
to them
Why
are you sleeping
Having risen up
pray
that
not
you might enter
228822	into
temptation
While still
of Him
speaking
behold
a crowd
and
he who
is called
Judas
228834	one
228836	of the
Twelve
was going before
them
and
he drew near
228843	-
to Jesus
to kiss
Him
Jesus
then
said
to him
Judas
with a kiss
228854	the
228856	Son
228858	-
of Man
are you betraying
Having seen
then
228864	those
228866	around
Him
what
would be
they said
Lord
if
will we strike
228875	with [the]
sword
And
struck
one
228881	a certain
228883	of
them
228887	of the
high priest
228890	the
servant
and
cut off
228895	the
228898	ear
his
228901	-
right
Answering
now
228906	-
Jesus
said
Allow you
228911	as far as
thus
And
having touched
228916	the
ear
He healed
him
Said
then
Jesus
228924	to
228926	those
228928	having come out
228930	against
Him
chief priests
and
228935	captains
228937	of the
temple
and
elders
As
228943	against
a robber
have you come out
228947	with
swords
and
clubs
228952	Every
day
being
of Me
228957	with
you
228960	in
228962	the
temple
not
did you stretch out
228967	the
hands
228970	against
Me
but
this
is
228976	of you
228978	the
hour
and
228982	the
228984	power
228986	of the
darkness
Having seized
then
Him
they led [Him] away
and
led [Him]
228995	into
228997	the
228999	house
229001	of the
high priest
229004	-
And
Peter
was following
afar off
They having kindled
then
a fire
229013	in
229015	[the] midst
229017	of the
courtyard
and
having sat down together
was sitting
229023	-
Peter
229026	among
them
Having seen
then
him
229032	a servant girl
certain
sitting
229036	by
229038	the
light
and
having looked intently on
him
she said
229045	Also
this one
229048	with
Him
was
-
But
he denied [it]
saying
Not
I do know
Him
woman
And
229061	after
a little
another
having seen
him
was saying
229068	Also
you
229071	of
them
are
229075	-
But
Peter
was saying
Man
not
I am
And
having elapsed
229085	about
229087	hour
one
229090	other
a certain
strongly affirmed [it]
saying
229095	Of
a truth
229098	also
this one
229101	with
Him
was
229105	also
for
a Galilean
he is
Said
however
229112	-
Peter
Man
not
I know
what
you say
And
immediately
while
he was speaking
of him
crowed
the rooster
And
having turned
229129	the
Lord
looked at
229133	-
Peter
and
remembered
229138	-
Peter
229141	the
229143	word
229145	of the
Lord
how
He had said
to him
-
Before
[the] rooster
crows
today
you will deny
Me
three times
And
having gone forth
outside
he wept
bitterly
And
229165	the
men
who
are holding
Him
began mocking
Him
beating [Him]
And
having blindfolded
Him
they were questioning [Him]
saying
Prophesy
who
is
the [one]
having struck
You
And
229186	other things
many
blaspheming
they were saying
229191	to
Him
And
when
it became
day
were gathered together
229199	the
229201	elderhood
229203	of the
people
chief priests
both
and
scribes
and
they led
Him
229213	into
229215	the
229217	council
of them
saying
If
You
are
229224	the
Christ
tell
us
He said
then
to them
If
you
I should tell
229235	no
not
would you believe
if
then
I should ask [you]
229242	no
not
would you answer
229246	From
229248	-
now on
also
229252	will be
229254	the
229256	Son
229258	-
of Man
sitting
229262	at
229264	[the] right hand
229266	of the
229268	power
229270	-
of God
They said
then
all
You
then
are
229279	the
229281	Son
229283	-
of God
-
And
229288	to
them
He was saying
You
say
that
I
am
-
And
they said
What
any more
have we
229303	of witness
need
We ourselves
for
have heard [it]
229309	from
229311	the
229313	mouth
of Him
And
having risen up
229318	all
229320	the
229322	multitude
of them
led
Him
229327	to
229329	-
Pilate
They began
then
to accuse
Him
saying
This [man]
we found
misleading
229340	the
229342	nation
of us
and
forbidding
tribute
to Caesar
to be given
and
declaring
Himself
Christ
a king
to be
229356	-
And
Pilate
questioned
Him
saying
You
are
229365	the
229367	King
229369	of the
Jews
-
And
answering
him
He was saying
You
say
229379	-
And
Pilate
said
229384	to
229386	the
chief priests
and
229390	the
crowds
Not
find I
guilt
229396	in
229399	the
man
this
-
But
they kept insisting
saying
-
He stirs up
229409	the
people
teaching
229413	throughout
229415	all
229417	-
of Judea
and
He has begun
229422	from
229424	-
Galilee
229427	even to
here
Pilate
now
having heard
asked
whether
229435	the
man
a Galilean
is
and
having learned
that
229443	from
229445	the
229447	jurisdiction
of Herod
He is
he sent up
Him
229453	to
229455	Herod
being
229458	also
he himself
229461	in
Jerusalem
229464	in
229466	those
229468	-
days
229471	-
And
Herod
having seen
229476	-
Jesus
[was] glad
exceedingly
229481	he was
for
229484	of
229486	a long
time
wishing
to see
Him
229492	because of
-
hearing
229496	concerning
Him
and
he was hoping
229501	some
sign
to see
229505	by
Him
done
He kept questioning
then
Him
229512	in
229514	words
many
He
however
nothing
answered
him
Had been standing by
now
229524	the
chief priests
and
229528	the
scribes
vehemently
accusing
Him
Having set at naught
then
Him
229537	-
Herod
229540	with
229542	the
229544	troops
of him
and
having mocked [Him]
having put on [Him]
229550	apparel
splendid
sent back
him
229555	to
Pilate
Became
then
friends
229561	-
both
Herod
and
229566	-
Pilate
229569	on
229571	that
229573	-
day
229576	with
one another
previously it had been that
for
229581	at
enmity
they were
229585	between
themselves
Pilate
then
having called together
229591	the
chief priests
and
229595	the
rulers
and
229599	the
people
said
229603	to
them
You brought
to me
229609	the
man
this
as
misleading
229615	the
people
and
behold
I
229621	before
you
having examined [Him]
nothing
found
229627	in
229630	the
man
this
229634	guilty
of that
accusation you are bringing
229638	against
Him
No
not even
Herod [did]
he sent back
for
Him
229647	to
us
And
behold
229652	nothing
229654	worthy
of death
229657	is
done
by Him
Having chastised
therefore
Him
I will release [Him]
They cried out
however
all together
saying
Away with
this [man]
release
now
to us
229674	-
Barabbas
who
229678	was
229680	on account of
229683	insurrection
a certain
having been made
229687	in
229689	the
city
and
murder
having been cast
229695	into
229697	the
prison
Again
therefore
229702	-
Pilate
called
to them
wishing
to release
229709	-
Jesus
-
But
they were crying out
saying
Crucify
crucify
Him
-
And
a third [time]
he said
229723	to
them
229726	What
for
evil
did commit
this [man]
229732	No
229734	cause
of death
found I
229738	in
Him
Having chastised
therefore
Him
I will release [Him]
-
But
they were urgent
229748	with voices
loud
asking for
Him
to be crucified
And
were prevailing
229756	the
229758	voices
of them
and
Pilate
sentenced
to be done
229765	the
229767	demand
of them
He released
then
the [one]
229773	on account of
insurrection
and
murder
having been cast
229779	into
prison
whom
they had asked for
229784	-
and
Jesus
he delivered
229789	to the
229791	will
of them
And
as
they led away
Him
having laid hold on
229800	Simon
a certain
of Cyrene
coming
229805	from
the country
they put upon
him
229810	the
cross
to carry
229814	behind
229816	-
Jesus
Were following
now
Him
229822	a great
229824	multitude
229826	of the
people
and
of women
who
were mourning
and
lamenting for
Him
Having turned
then
229838	to
them
Jesus
said
229843	Daughters
of Jerusalem
not
weep
229848	for
Me
but
229852	for
yourselves
weep
and
229857	for
229859	the
229861	children
of you
For
behold
are coming
days
229868	in
which
they will say
Blessed [are]
229873	the
barren
and
229877	the
wombs
that
never
did bear
and
breasts
that
never
nursed
Then
They will begin
to say
229891	to the
mountains
Fall
229895	upon
us
and
229899	to the
hills
Cover
us
For
if
229906	in
229908	green
tree
these things
they do
229913	in
229915	the
dry
what
might take place
Were being led away
now
229922	also
229924	other
229926	criminals
two
229929	with
Him
to be put to death
And
when
they came
229936	to
229938	the
place
-
called
The Skull
there
they crucified
Him
and
229948	the
criminals
one
-
229953	on [the]
right
one
now
229958	on
[the] left
229961	-
And
Jesus
was saying
Father
forgive
them
not
for
they know
what
they do
Dividing
then
229976	the
229978	garments
of Him
they cast
lots
And
stood
229985	the
people
beholding
Were deriding [Him]
then
229991	also
229993	the
rulers
saying
Others
He saved
let Him save
Himself
if
this
is
230004	the
230006	Christ
230008	-
of God
230011	the
Chosen [One]
Mocked
then
Him
230017	also
230019	the
soldiers
coming near
sour wine
offering
Him
and
saying
If
You
are
230031	the
230033	King
230035	of the
Jews
save
Yourself
There was
now
230042	also
an inscription
230045	over
Him
230048	The
230050	King
230052	of the
Jews
This
230056	One
now
230059	of the
230061	having been hanged
criminals
was railing at
Him
Not
you are
if
230069	the
Christ
Save
Yourself
and
us
Answering
now
230078	the
other
was rebuking
him
saying
Not even
do fear
you
230087	-
God
that
230091	under
230093	the
230095	same
judgment
you are
and
we
indeed
justly
230103	Worthy
for
of what
we did
we are receiving
[this] man
however
230111	nothing
wrong
did
And
he was saying
Jesus
remember
me
when
You come
230122	into
230124	the
230126	kingdom
of You
And
He said
to him
Truly
to you
I say
today
230136	with
Me
you will be
230140	in
230142	-
Paradise
And
it was
now
230148	about
230150	[the] hour
sixth
and
darkness
came
230156	over
230158	all
230160	the
land
230163	until
230165	[the] hour
ninth
230168	The
sun
was darkened
was torn
then
230174	the
230176	veil
230178	of the
temple
in [the] middle
And
having called out
230184	in a voice
loud
230187	-
Jesus
said
Father
230192	into
230194	[the] hands
of You
I commit
230198	the
230200	Spirit
of Me
This
now
having said
He breathed His last
Having seen
now
230209	the
centurion
that
having taken place
he began glorifying
230215	-
God
saying
Certainly
230221	the
man
this
righteous
was
And
230228	all
230230	the
230232	having come together
crowds
230235	to
230238	the
spectacle
this
having seen
the things
having taken place
beating
230246	the
breasts
were returning [home]
Stood
now
230252	all
230254	those who
230256	knew
Him
230259	from
afar off
also
women
those
having followed
Him
230267	from
230269	-
Galilee
beholding
these things
And
behold
230278	a man
named
Joseph
a Council member
being
230284	a man
good
and
righteous
he
not
230291	was
having consented
230295	to the
counsel
and
230299	the
deed
of them
230303	from
Arimathea
230306	a city
230308	of the
Jews
who
was waiting for
230313	the
230315	kingdom
230317	-
of God
He
having gone
230322	-
to Pilate
asked [for]
230326	the
230328	body
230330	-
of Jesus
And
having taken it down
he wrapped
it
in a linen cloth
and
placed
it
230341	in
230343	a tomb
cut in a rock
in which
no
230348	had been
no one
not yet
laid
And
230354	[the] Day
it was
of Preparation
and
Sabbath
was just beginning
Having followed
then
230363	the
women
who
230367	were
come
230370	out of
230372	-
Galilee
with Him
saw
230377	the
tomb
and
how
was laid
230383	the
230385	body
of Him
Having returned
then
they prepared
spices
and
anointing oils
And
230395	on the
indeed
Sabbath
they rested
230400	according to
230402	the
commandment
230405	The
however
230408	first [day]
230410	of the
week
230413	dawn
very early
230416	to
230418	the
tomb
they came
bringing
that
they had prepared
spices
They found
then
230428	the
stone
having been rolled away
230432	from
230434	the
tomb
Having entered
however
not
they found
230441	the
230443	body
230445	of the
Lord
Jesus
And
it came to pass
230451	while
-
are perplexed
they
230456	about
this
that
behold
230461	men
two
stood by
them
230466	in
230468	garments
dazzling
Terrified
then
having become
of them
and
bowing
230477	the
faces
230480	to
230482	the
ground
they said
230486	to
them
Why
seek you
the
living
230493	among
230495	the
dead
Not
He is
here
but
He is risen
Remember
how
He spoke
to you
yet
being
230509	in
230511	-
Galilee
saying
230515	The
230517	Son
230519	-
of Man
-
it behooves
to be delivered
230525	into
230527	hands
230529	of men
sinful
and
to be crucified
and
230535	the
230537	third
day
to arise
And
they remembered
230543	the
230545	words
of Him
And
having returned
230550	from
230552	the
tomb
they related
230556	these things
all
230559	to the
eleven
and
230563	to all
230565	the
rest
It was
now
230570	-
Magdalene
Mary
and
Joanna
and
Mary
230578	the [mother]
of James
and
230583	the
other women
230586	with
them
telling
230590	to
230592	the
apostles
these things
And
appeared
230598	before
them
230601	like
folly
230605	the
words
of them
and
they did not believe
them
230612	-
But
Peter
having risen up
ran
230618	to
230620	the
tomb
and
having stooped down
he sees
230626	the
linen strips
only
and
he went away
230632	in
himself
wondering at
that
having come to pass
And
behold
230640	two
230642	of
them
230645	on
230647	same
230649	the
day
230652	were
going
230655	to
230657	a village
being distant
230660	stadia
sixty
230663	from
Jerusalem
whose
name [is]
Emmaus
and
they
were talking
230672	with
one another
230675	about
230678	all
-
having taken place
these things
And
it came to pass
230685	in
the
talking
of them
and
reasoning
that
230693	Himself
Jesus
having drawn near
was walking along with
them
230699	-
but
230702	the eyes
of them
were held
-
not
to know
Him
He said
then
230712	to
them
What
230717	-
words [are]
these
that
you exchange
230723	with
one another
walking
And
they stood still
looking sad
Answering
now
230732	[the] one
named
Cleopas
said
230737	to
Him
You
alone
visit
Jerusalem
and
not
have known
the things
having come to pass
230749	in
it
230752	in
230755	the
days
these
And
He said
to them
What things
-
And
they said
to Him
230767	The things
230769	concerning
Jesus
230772	of
Nazareth
who
was
a man
230778	a prophet
230780	mighty
230782	in
deed
and
word
230787	before
230789	-
God
and
230793	all
230795	the
people
that
then
delivered up
him
230802	the
chief priests
and
230806	the
230808	rulers
of us
230811	to
230813	[the] judgment
of death
and
crucified
Him
We
however
were hoping
-
He
it is
who
is about
to redeem
230828	-
Israel
But
indeed
230833	also
230835	with
230837	all
these things
230840	[the] third
230842	this
day
brings
230846	away from
which
these things
came to pass
However
230852	also
230855	women
certain
230858	out from
us
astonished
us
Having been
early
230865	to
230867	the
tomb
and
not
having found
230873	the
230875	body
of Him
they came
declaring
230880	also
230882	a vision
of angels
to have seen
who
say
He
is alive
And
went
230892	some
230894	of those
230896	with
us
230899	to
230901	the
tomb
and
found [it]
so
as
230908	also
230910	the
women
said
Him
however
not
they saw
And
He
said
230921	to
them
230924	O
foolish
and
230929	slow
230931	-
of heart
-
to believe
230936	in
230938	all
that
have spoken
230942	the
prophets
Not
these things
was it necessary for
to suffer
230949	the
Christ
and
to enter
230954	into
230956	the
230958	glory
of Him
And
having begun
230963	from
Moses
and
230967	from
230969	all
230971	the
Prophets
He interpreted
to them
230976	in
230978	all
230980	the
Scriptures
230983	the things
230985	concerning
Himself
And
they drew near
230990	to
230992	the
village
where
they were going
and
He
appeared
farther
to be going
And
they constrained
Him
saying
Abide
231007	with
us
for
231011	toward
evening
it is
and
has declined
now
231018	the
day
And
He entered in
-
to abide
231025	with
them
And
it came to pass
231030	in
the
reclining
of Him
231035	with
them
having taken
231039	the
bread
He blessed [it]
and
having broken [it]
He began giving [it]
to them
231047	Of them
then
were opened
231051	the
eyes
and
they knew
Him
And
He
vanished
being seen
231061	from
them
And
they said
231066	to
one another
Not
231070	the
231072	heart
of us
231075	burning
was
231078	within
us
as
He was speaking
with us
231084	on
231086	the
road
as
He was opening
to us
231092	the
Scriptures
And
having risen up
231097	[that] same
231099	-
hour
they returned
231103	to
Jerusalem
and
they found
gathered together
231109	the
eleven
and
231113	those
231115	with
them
saying
-
Indeed
has risen
231122	the
Lord
and
He has appeared
to Simon
And
they
began relating
231131	the things
231133	on
231135	the
road
and
how
He was known
to them
231142	in
231144	the
231146	breaking
231148	of the
bread
These things
now
of them
as they were telling
He Himself
stood
231157	in
231159	midst
of them
and
says
to them
Peace
to you
Having been terrified
however
and
filled with fear
having been
they were thinking [themselves]
a spirit
to see
And
He said
to them
Why
231179	troubled
are you
and
231183	through
why
doubts
do come up
231188	in
231190	the
231192	hearts
of you
See
231196	the
231198	hands
of Me
and
231202	the
231204	feet
of Me
that
I
am
He
Touch
Me
and
see
for
a spirit
flesh
and
bones
not
has
as
Me
you see
having
And
this
having said
He showed
to them
231231	the
hands
and
231235	the
feet
Still
now
while they were disbelieving
of them
231242	for
231244	the
joy
and
amazement
He said
to them
Have you
231252	anything
to eat
here
-
And
they gave
to Him
231261	of a fish
broiled
part
And
having taken [it]
231267	before
them
He ate [it]
He said
now
231273	unto
to them
These [are]
231277	the
231279	words
of me
which
I spoke
231284	to
you
still
being
231289	with
you
that
it behooves
to be fulfilled
231295	all things
-
having been written
231299	in
231301	the
231303	law
of Moses
and
231307	the
Prophets
and
[the] Psalms
231312	concerning
Me
Then
He opened
231317	their
231319	-
mind
-
to understand
231324	the
Scriptures
And
He said
to them
-
Thus
it has been written
Was to suffer
231334	the
Christ
and
to rise
231339	out from
[the] dead
231342	the
231344	third
day
and
to be proclaimed
231349	in
231351	the
231353	name
of Him
231356	repentance
231358	and
231360	forgiveness
of sins
231363	to
231365	all
231367	-
nations
having begun
231371	from
Jerusalem
You
231375	witnesses
of these things
And
behold
I
am sending
231382	the
231384	promise
231386	of the
231388	Father
of Me
231391	upon
you
you
however
remain
231397	in
231399	the
city
231402	until
that
you should be clothed with
231406	from
on high
power
He led
now
them
231413	as far as
231415	to
Bethany
and
having lifted up
231420	the
231422	hands
of Him
He blessed
them
And
it came to pass
231429	in
the
blessing
of Him
them
He was separated
231436	from
them
and
was carried up
231441	into
231443	-
heaven
And
they
having worshiped
Him
returned
231451	to
Jerusalem
231454	with
231456	joy
great
and
231460	were
231462	continually
all
231465	in
231467	the
temple
blessing
231471	-
God
231474	In [the]
beginning
was
231478	the
Word
and
231482	the
Word
was
231486	with
231488	-
God
and
God
was
231494	the
Word
He
was
231499	in [the]
beginning
231502	with
231504	-
God
All things
231508	through
Him
came into being
and
231513	without
Him
came into being
not even
one [thing]
that
has come into being
231521	In
Him
life
was
and
231527	the
life
was
231531	the
231533	light
231535	-
of men
And
231539	the
Light
231542	in
231544	the
darkness
shines
and
231549	the
darkness
it
not
overcame
There came
231556	a man
having been sent
231559	from
God
[the] name
to Him
[was] John
He
came
231567	as
a witness
that
he might testify
231572	concerning
231574	the
Light
that
all
might believe
231580	through
him
Not
was
He
231586	the
Light
but
that
he might witness
231592	concerning
231594	the
Light
231597	Was
231599	the
231601	Light
231603	-
true
who
enlightens
231608	every
man
coming
231612	into
231614	the
world
231617	In
231619	the
world
He was
and
231624	the
world
231627	through
Him
came into being
and
231632	the
world
Him
not
knew
231638	To
231640	the
own
He came
and
231645	the
own
Him
not
received
As many as
however
received
Him
He gave
to them
authority
231658	children
of God
to be
to those
believing
231664	in
231666	the
231668	name
of Him
who
not
231673	of
blood
nor
231677	of
231679	will
of flesh
nor
231683	of
231685	will
of man
but
231689	of
God
were born
And
231694	the
Word
flesh
became
and
dwelt
231701	among
us
and
we beheld
231707	the
231709	glory
of Him
231712	a glory
231714	as
231716	of an only begotten
231718	from
[the] Father
231721	full
of grace
and
truth
John
witnesses
231728	concerning
Him
and
he cried out
saying
This
was He
of whom
I was saying
The [One]
231739	after
me
coming
231743	precedence
over me
has
because
before
me
He was
For
231752	from
231754	the
231756	fullness
of Him
231759	we
all
have received
231763	then
grace
231766	for
grace
For
231770	the
law
231773	through
Moses
was given
231777	-
grace
and
231781	-
truth
231784	through
Jesus
Christ
came
God
no one
has seen
ever yet
231794	[the] only begotten
God
the [One]
being
231799	in
231801	the
231803	bosom
231805	of the
Father
He
has made [Him] known
And
this
is
231813	the
231815	testimony
231817	-
of John
when
sent
231822	to
him
231825	the
Jews
231828	from
Jerusalem
priests
and
Levites
that
they might ask
him
You
who
are
And
he confessed
and
not
denied
but
confessed
-
I
not
am
231851	the
Christ
And
they asked
him
What
then
You
Elijah
are
And
he says
Not
I am
231866	The
prophet
are
you
And
he answered
No
They said
therefore
to him
Who
are you
That
an answer
we might give
to those
having sent
us
what
say you
231887	about
yourself
He was saying
I [am]
231892	a voice
crying
231895	in
231897	the
wilderness
Make straight
231901	the
231903	way
of [the] Lord
as
said
Isaiah
231909	the
prophet
And
[those] having been sent
were
231915	out from
231917	the
Pharisees
And
they asked
him
and
said
to him
Why
then
baptize you
if
you

of Him
233608	into

He was staying

233665	disciples
of John
233668	with
[a certain] Jew
233671	about

And
they came
233676	to
233678	-
John
and
said
to him
Rabbi
He who
was
233687	with

you
have borne witness

He
baptizes
and
all

Answered
John
and
said
Nothing

233779	This
therefore

has set his seal

When
therefore
knew
233937	-
Jesus
that
heard
233942	the
Pharisees
that
Jesus
233947	more
disciples
makes

baptizes
than
John
although indeed
233956	Jesus
Himself
not
was baptizing
but
233962	the
233964	disciples
of Him
He left
233968	-
Judea
and
went away
again
233974	into
233976	-

It was necessary for
now
Him
to pass

of him
Was
now
there

Therefore
Jesus
being wearied
234028	from

journey
was sitting
thus
234035	at
234037	the

234066	the disciples
of Him
had gone away

Jesus
and
said
to her

who

I
will give
him
234226	never
not

Instead

will become
234243	in
him
234246	a spring

Says
to her
234367	-
Jesus
Believe
Me

worshipers
will worship
234425	the

234486	upon

They went forth
234552	out of
234554	the
city
and
were coming
234559	unto
Him
234562	But in
234564	the
meantime
were asking
Him
234569	the
disciples
saying
Rabbi

-
But
He said
to them
I
food
have
to eat
that
you
not
know
Were saying
therefore
234589	the
disciples
234592	to
one another
No
one
did bring
Him
[anything] to eat
Says
to them
234602	-
Jesus
234605	My
food
is
that
I should do
234611	the
234613	will
of the [One]
having sent
Me
and
should finish
234620	of Him
234622	the
work
Not

together
may rejoice

for
this
234682	the
saying
is
true
-
One
is

sowing
and
another
-
reaping
I
sent
you
to reap
what
not
you
have toiled for
others

that
234724	many
believed
234727	in
Him
234730	of the
Samaritans
234733	because of
234735	the
234737	word
234739	of the
woman
testifying
-
He told
me
234746	all things
whatever
I did
When
therefore
came
234753	to
Him
234756	the
Samaritans
they were asking
Him
to abide
234762	with
them
and
He stayed
there
234768	two
days
And
234772	many
more
believed
234776	because of
234778	the
234780	word
of Him
234783	-
and
to the woman
they were saying
-
No longer
234790	because of
234792	-
234794	your
speech
we believe
we ourselves
for
have heard
and
we know
that
this
is
truly
234807	the
234809	Savior
234811	of the
world
234814	After
then
234817	the
234819	two
days
He went forth
from there
234824	into
234826	-
Galilee
234829	Himself
for
Jesus
testified
that
a prophet
234836	in
234838	the
234840	own
hometown

When
therefore
He came
234849	into
234851	-
Galilee
received
Him
234856	the
Galileans
234859	all things
having seen
how great
He had done
234864	in
Jerusalem
234867	during
234869	the
feast
234872	also
themselves
for
they had gone
234877	to
234879	the
feast
He came
therefore
again
234885	to
234887	-
234889	Cana
234891	-
of Galilee
where
He had made
234896	the
water
wine
And
there was
234902	a certain
royal official
234905	whose
234907	-
son
was sick
234911	in
Capernaum
He
having heard
that
Jesus
had come
234919	out of
234921	-
Judea
234924	into
234926	-
Galilee
went
234930	to
Him
and
was asking
that
He would come down
and
heal
234939	his
234941	-
son
he was about
for
to die
Said
therefore
234949	-
Jesus
234952	to
him
If
not
signs
and
wonders
you people see
234961	no
not
will you believe
Says
234966	to
Him
234969	the
royal official
Sir

before
dies
234976	the
234978	child
of me
Says
to him
234983	-
Jesus
Go
234987	the
234989	son
of you
lives
Believed
234994	the
man
234997	the
word
that
said
to him
235003	-
Jesus
and
he went on his way
Already
then
[as] he
is going down
235012	the
servants
met
him
saying
that
235019	the
235021	boy
of him
lives
He inquired
therefore
235027	the
hour
235030	from
them
235033	in
which
better
he got
They said
therefore
to him
-
Yesterday
235043	[at the] hour
seventh
left
him
235048	the
fever
Knew
therefore
235053	the
father
that [it was]
235057	that
235059	the
hour
235062	at
which
said
to him
235067	-
Jesus
235070	The
235072	son
of You
lives
And
he believed
himself
and
235081	the
235083	household
of him

Jesus
having come
235099	out of
235101	-
Judea
235104	into
235106	-
Galilee
235109	After
these things
there was
235113	a feast
235115	of the
Jews
and
went up
Jesus
235121	to
Jerusalem
There is
now
235126	in
235128	-
Jerusalem

awaiting

An angel
for
235167	during
[a certain] season
descended
235171	into
235173	the
pool
and
stirred
235178	the
water
235181	He who
therefore
first
entered
235186	after
235188	the
235190	stirring
235192	of the
water
well
was made
from whatever
at the time
he was held by
disease
Was
now
235203	a certain
man
there
235207	thirty
and
eight
years
being
235213	in

Him
having seen
235222	-
Jesus
lying
and
having known
that
235229	a long
already
time
he has been
He says
to him
Desire you
well
to become

Him
the [one]
ailing
Sir
a man
not
I have
that
when
has been stirred
235250	the
water
he might put
me
235255	into
235257	the
pool
235260	in
which
now
am going
I

235267	before
me
descends
Says
to him
235273	-
Jesus
Arise
take up
235278	the
235280	mat
of you
and
walk
And
immediately
became
well
235289	the
man
and
he took up
235294	the
235296	mat
of him
and
began to walk
It was
now
Sabbath
235304	on
235306	that
235308	-
day
Were saying
therefore
235313	the
Jews
to the [one]
having been healed
Sabbath
it is
and
not
it is lawful
for you
to take up
235325	the
mat
who
however
answered
them
The [One]
having made
me
well
that One
to me
said
Take up
235340	the
235342	mat
of you
and
walk
They asked
him
Who
is
235351	the
man
-
having said
to you
Take up
and
walk
The [one]
now
having been healed
not
knew
who
it is
235367	-
for
Jesus
had moved away
a crowd
being
235374	in
235376	the
place
235379	After
these things
finds
him
235384	-
Jesus
235387	in
235389	the
temple
and
said
to him
Behold
well
you have become
no more
sin
that
not
235402	worse
to you
something
happens
Went away
235408	the
man
and
told
235413	the
Jews
that
Jesus
it is
the [One]
having made
him
well
And
235424	because of
this
were persecuting
235428	the
Jews
235431	-
Jesus
because
these things
He was doing
235437	on
[the] Sabbath
-
But
answered
them
235444	The
235446	Father
of Me
235449	until
now
is working
and I
am working
235455	Because of
this
therefore
the more
were seeking
Him
235462	the
Jews
to kill
because
not
only
was He breaking
235470	the
Sabbath
but
235474	also
235476	Father
His own
He was calling
235480	-
God
equal
Himself
making
235486	to
God
Answered
therefore
235491	-
Jesus
and
was saying
to them
Truly
truly
I say
to you
not
is able
235503	the
Son
to do
235507	of
Himself
nothing
if
not
anything
He might see
235515	the
Father
doing
whatever
for
-
He
does
these things
235525	also
235527	the
Son
likewise
does
235532	-
For
the Father
loves
235537	the
Son
and
235541	all things
shows
to Him
that
He
does
and
235550	greater
than these
He will show
Him
works
so that
you
may marvel
Even as
for
235561	the
Father
raises up
235565	the
dead
and
gives life
thus
235571	also
235573	the
Son
to whom
He will
gives life
Not even
for
235581	the
Father
judges
no one
but
235588	-
judgment
all
has given
235593	to the
Son
so that
all
may honor
235599	the
Son
even as
they honor
235604	the
Father
He who
not
is honoring
235610	the
Son
not
is honoring
235615	the
Father
the [One]
having sent
Him
Truly
truly
I say
to you
that
the [one]
235627	the
235629	word
of Me
hearing
and
believing
the [One]
having sent
Me
he has
235639	life
eternal
and
235643	into
judgment
not
comes
but
has passed
235650	out of
235652	-
death
235655	into
235657	-
life
Truly
truly
I say
to you
that
is coming
an hour
and
now
is
when
235671	the
dead
will hear
235675	the
235677	voice
235679	of the
235681	Son
235683	-
of God
and
those
having heard
will live
As
for
235692	the
Father
has
life
235697	in
Himself
so
235701	also
235703	to the
Son
He gave
life
to have
235709	in
Himself
And
authority
He gave
Him
judgment
to execute
because
235719	Son
of Man
He is
Not
marvel at
this
for
is coming
an hour
235729	in
which
235732	all
235734	those
235736	in
235738	the
tombs
will hear
235742	the
235744	voice
of Him
and
will come forth
those
235750	-
good
having done
235754	to
235756	[the] resurrection
of life
-
235760	those
evil
having done
235764	to
235766	[the] resurrection
of judgment
Not
am able
I
to do
235773	of
Myself
nothing
as
I hear
I judge
and
235781	the
235783	judgment
235785	-
of Me
just
is
because
not
I seek
235793	the
235795	will
235797	-
of Me
but
235801	the
235803	will
of the [One]
having sent
Me
If
I
bear witness
235811	concerning
Myself
235814	the
235816	testimony
of Me
not
is
true
Another
it is
-
bearing witness
235826	concerning
Me
and
I know
that
true
is
235834	the
testimony
which
he bears witness
235839	concerning
Me
You
have sent
235844	unto
John
and
he has borne witness
235849	to the
truth
I
now
not
235855	from
man
235858	the
testimony
receive
but
these things
I say
that
you
may be saved
He
was
235870	the
lamp
-
burning
and
shining
you
now
were willing
to rejoice
235881	for
a season
235884	in
235886	the
235888	light
of him
I
however
have
235894	the
testimony
235897	greater than
235899	that
of John
235902	-
For
the works
that
has given
Me
235909	the
Father
that
I should complete
them
235915	same
235917	the
works
which
I do
bear witness
235923	concerning
Me
that
235927	the
Father
Me
has sent
And
235933	the [One]
235935	having sent
Me
[the] Father
Himself
has borne witness
235941	concerning
Me
Neither
235945	voice
of Him
at any time
have You heard
nor
235951	form
of Him
have you seen
And
235956	the
235958	word
of Him
not
you have
235963	in
you
abiding
for
whom
sent
He
Him
you
not
believe
You diligently search
235976	the
Scriptures
for
you
think
235982	in
them
235985	life
eternal
to have
and
these
are they
-
bearing witness
235994	concerning
Me
and
not
you are willing
to come
236001	to
Me
that
life
you may have
Glory
236008	from
men
not
I take
but
I have known
you
that
236017	the
236019	love
236021	-
of God
not
you have
236026	in
yourselves
I
have come
236031	in
236033	the
236035	name
236037	of the
236039	Father
of Me
and
not
you receive
Me
if
another
should come
236049	in
236051	the
236053	name
236055	the
own
him
you will receive
How
are able
you
to believe
glory
236065	from
one another
receiving
and
236070	the
glory
236073	that [is]
236075	from
236077	the
236079	only
God
not
you seek
Not
think
that
I
will accuse
you
236090	to
236092	the
Father
There is
[one]
accusing
you
Moses
236100	in
whom
you
have hoped
If
for
you were believing
Moses
you would have believed

Me
236112	concerning
for
Me
he
wrote
If
now
236120	-
236122	his
writings
not
you believe
how
236128	-
236130	My
words
will you believe
236134	After
these things
went away
236138	-
Jesus
236141	over
236143	the
236145	Sea
236147	-
of Galilee
236150	-
of Tiberias
Was following
now
Him
236156	a crowd
great
because
they were seeing
236161	the
signs
which
He was doing
236166	upon
those
being sick
Went up
now
236172	on
236174	the
mountain
Jesus
and
there
He was sitting
236181	with
236183	the
236185	disciples
of Him
Was
now
near
236191	the
Passover
236194	the
236196	feast
236198	of the
Jews
Having lifted up
then
236203	the
eyes
236206	-
Jesus
and
having seen
that
236212	a great
crowd
is coming
236216	to
Him
He says
236220	to
Philip
From where
shall we buy
bread
that
might eat
these
This
now
He was saying
testing
him
He
for
knew
what
He was about
to do
Answered
Him
236242	-
Philip
236246	Two hundred
denarii worth
of loaves
not
are sufficient
for them
that
each
236255	little [piece]
one
might receive
Says
to Him
236261	one
236263	of
236265	the
236267	disciples
of Him
Andrew
236271	the
236273	brother
of Simon
Peter
Is
a little boy
here
who
has
236282	five
236284	loaves
barley
and
236288	two
small fish
but
these
what
are
236295	for
so many
Said
236299	-
Jesus
Make
236303	the
men
to recline
There was
now
236309	grass
much
236312	in
236314	the
place
Reclined
therefore
236319	the
men
236322	the
number
236325	about
five thousand
Took
then
236330	the
loaves
236333	-
Jesus
and
having given thanks
He distributed
to those
reclining
likewise
236342	also
236344	of
236346	the
fish
as much as
they wished
When
now
they were filled
He says
236355	to the
236357	disciples
of Him
Gather together
236361	the
236363	having been over and above
fragments
so that
nothing
anything
may be lost
They gathered together
therefore
and
filled
236374	twelve
hand-baskets
of fragments
236378	from
236380	the
236382	five
loaves
236385	-
barley
which
were over and above
to those
having eaten
236392	The
therefore
people
having seen
what
He had done
[the] sign
were saying
-
This
is
truly
236405	the
prophet
who
is coming
236410	into
236412	the
world
236416	Jesus
therefore
having known
that
they are about
to come
and
to seize
Him
that
they might make [Him]
king
withdrew
again
236431	to
236433	the
mountain
Himself
alone
When
now
evening
it became
went down
236443	the
236445	disciples
of Him
236448	to
236450	the
sea
and
having entered
236455	into
a boat
they were going
236459	over
236461	the
sea
236464	to
Capernaum
And
dark
already
it had become
and
not
had come
236474	to
them
236477	-
Jesus
236480	-
And
the sea
236484	by a wind
strong
blowing
was agitated
Having rowed
therefore
236491	about
236493	stadia
twenty
five
or
thirty
they see
236500	-
Jesus
walking
236504	on
236506	the
sea
and
236510	near
236512	the
boat
coming
and
they were frightened
-
And
He says
to them
I
am [He]
not
fear
They were willing
then
to receive
Him
236530	into
236532	the
boat
and
immediately
was
236538	the
boat
236541	at
236543	the
land
236546	to
which
they were going
236550	On the
next day
236553	the
crowd
-
standing
236558	on the other side
236560	of the
sea
having seen
that
236565	boat
other
no
was
there
if
not
one
and
that
not
went with
236578	the
236580	disciples
of Him
236583	-
Jesus
236586	into
236588	the
boat
but
alone
236593	the
236595	disciples
of Him
went away
but other
came
boats
236602	from
Tiberias
236605	near
236607	the
place
where
they ate
236612	the
bread
having given thanks
236616	the
Lord
When
therefore
saw
236622	the
crowd
that
Jesus
not
is
there
nor
236631	the
236633	disciples
of Him
they entered
themselves
236638	into
236640	the
boats
and
came
236645	to
Capernaum
seeking
236649	-
Jesus
And
having found
Him
236655	on the other side
236657	of the
sea
they said
to Him
Rabbi
when
here
have You come
Answered
them
236668	-
Jesus
and
said
Truly
truly
I say
to you
you seek
Me
not
because
you saw
signs
but
because
you ate
236686	of
236688	the
loaves
and
were satisfied
Work
not [for]
236695	the
food
that
is perishing
but [for]
236701	the
food
-
enduring
236706	unto
236708	life
eternal
which
236712	the
236714	Son
236716	-
of Man
to you
will give
Him
for
236723	the
Father
has sealed
236727	-
God
They said
therefore
236732	to
Him
What
must we do
that
we may be doing
236739	the
236741	works
236743	-
of God
Answered
Jesus
and
said
to them
This
is

236757	-
of God
that
you should believe

Him whom

He
They said
therefore
to Him
236770	What
then
do
You
[as a] sign
that
we may see
and
may believe
You
What

236783	The
236785	fathers
of us

ate
236792	in
236794	the
wilderness
as
236798	it is
written
236801	Bread
236803	from
236805	-
heaven
He gave
them
to eat
Said
therefore
to them
236814	-
Jesus
Truly
truly
I say
to you
not
Moses
has given
you
236825	the
236827	bread
236829	from
236831	-
heaven
but
236835	the
236837	Father
of Me
gives
you
236842	the
236845	bread
236847	from
236849	-
heaven
236852	-
true
236855	The
for
236858	bread
236860	-
of God
is
the [One]
coming down
236866	out of
236868	-
heaven
and
life
giving
236874	to the
world
They said
therefore
236879	to
Him
Sir
always
give
to us
236887	the
bread
this
Said
to them
236893	-
Jesus
I
am
236898	the
236900	bread
236902	-
of life
the [one]
coming
236907	to
Me
236910	never
not
shall hunger
and
the [one]
believing
236917	in
Me
236920	no
not
shall thirst
at any time
But
I said
to you
that
also
you have seen
Me
and yet
not
believe
236935	All
that
gives
Me
236940	the
Father
236943	to
Me
will come
and
the [one]
coming
236950	to
Me
236953	no
not
shall I cast
out
For
I have come down
236960	from
236962	-
heaven
not
that
I should do
236968	the
236970	will
236972	-
of Me
but
236976	the
236978	will
of the [One]
having sent
Me
This
now
is
236986	the
236988	will
of the [One]
having sent
Me
that
236994	all
that
He has given
Me
none
I should lose
237001	of
it
but
will raise up
it
237007	in
237009	the
237011	last
day
This
for
is
237017	the
237019	will
237021	of the
237023	Father
of Me
that
237027	everyone
-
beholding
237031	the
Son
and
believing
237036	in
Him
should have
237040	life
eternal
and
will raise up
him
I
237047	in
237049	the
237051	last
day
Were grumbling
therefore
237056	the
Jews
237059	about
Him
because
He said
I
am
237066	the
bread
-
having come down
237071	from
237073	-
heaven
And
they were saying
Not
this
is
Jesus
237082	the
237084	son
of Joseph
of whom
we
know
237090	the
father
and
237094	the
mother
How
then
says He
-
237101	From
237103	-
heaven
I have come down
Answered
Jesus
and
said
to them
Not
grumble
237114	with
one another
No one
is able
to come
237120	to
Me
if
not
237125	the
Father
the [one]
having sent
Me
draws
him
and I
will raise up
him
237136	in
237138	the
237140	last
day
237143	It is
written
237146	in
237148	the
prophets
And
they will be
all
237154	taught
of God
237157	Everyone
-
having heard
237161	from
237163	the
Father
and
having learned
comes
237169	to
Me
Not
that
237174	the
Father
has seen
anyone
if
not
the [One]
being
237183	from
237185	-
God
He
has seen
237190	the
Father
Truly
truly
I say
to you
the [one]
believing
has
237200	life
eternal
I
am
237205	the
237207	bread
237209	-
of life
237212	The
237214	fathers
of You
ate
237218	in
237220	the
wilderness
237223	the
manna
and
died
This
is
237230	the
bread
-
237234	from
237236	-
heaven
coming down
that
anyone
237242	of
it
may eat
and
not
die
I
am
237251	the
bread
-
living
-
237257	from
237259	-
heaven
having come down
if
anyone
shall have eaten
237266	of
237268	this
237270	-
bread
he will live
237274	to
237276	the
age
237279	and
237281	the
bread
also
that
I
will give
237288	the
237290	flesh
of Me
is
237294	for
237296	the
237299	of the
world
life
Were arguing
therefore
237305	with
one another
237308	the
Jews
saying
How
is able
this [man]
us
to give
237317	the
flesh
to eat
Said
therefore
to them
237324	-
Jesus
Truly
truly
I say
to you
if
not
you shall have eaten
237334	the
237336	flesh
237338	of the
237340	Son
237342	-
of Man
and
shall have drunk
237347	of Him
237349	the
blood
not
you have
life
237355	in
yourselves
The [one]
eating
237360	of Me
237362	the
flesh
and
drinking
237367	of Me
237369	the
blood
has
237373	life
eternal
and I
will raise up
him
237379	in the
237381	last
day
237384	The
for
237387	flesh
of Me
237390	true
is
food
and
237395	the
237397	blood
of Me
237400	true
is
drink
The [one]
eating
237406	of Me
237408	the
flesh
and
drinking
237413	of Me
237415	the
blood
237418	in
Me
abides
and I
237423	in
him
As
sent
Me
237429	the
237431	living
Father
and I
live
237436	because of
237438	the
Father
237441	also
the [one]
feeding on
Me
he also
will live
237448	because of
Me
This
is
237453	the
bread
-
237457	from
heaven
having come down
not
as
ate
237464	the
fathers
and
died
The [one]
eating
237471	this
237473	-
bread
will live
237477	to
237479	the
age
These things
He said
237484	in
[the] synagogue
teaching
237488	in
Capernaum
237491	Many
therefore
having heard
237495	of
237497	the
237499	disciples
of Him
said
Difficult
is
237506	the
word
this
who
is able
it
to hear
Knowing
however
237516	-
Jesus
237519	in
Himself
that
are grumbling
237524	about
this
237527	the
237529	disciples
of Him
He said
to them
This
you
does offend
What if
then
you should see
237540	the
237542	Son
237544	-
of Man
ascending
where
He was
237550	-
before
237553	The
Spirit
it is
-
giving life
237559	the
flesh
not
profits
nothing
237565	The
words
that
I
speak
to you
spirit
are
and
life
they are
But
they are
237580	of
you
some
who
not
believe
Knew
for
237589	from
[the] beginning
237592	-
Jesus
who
are
those
not
believing
and
who
it is
who
will betray
Him
And
He was saying
237608	Because of
this
have I said
to you
that
no one
is able
to come
237617	to
Me
if
not
237622	it shall
have been granted
to him
237626	from
237628	the
Father
237631	From
that [time]
237634	many
237636	the
237638	disciples
of Him
departed
237642	to
237644	the
back
and
no longer
237649	with
Him
walked
Said
therefore
237655	-
Jesus
237658	to the
Twelve
Not
237662	also
you
are wishing
to go away
Answered
Him
Simon
Peter
Lord
237672	to
whom
will we go
237676	[The] words
237678	of life
eternal
You have
and
we
have believed
and
have known
that
You
are
237690	the
237692	Holy One
237694	-
of God
Answered
them
237699	-
Jesus
Not
I
you
237705	the
Twelve
did choose
and
237711	of
you
one
a devil
is
He was speaking
now
237719	-
237721	of Judas
[son] of Simon
Iscariot
he
for
was about
to betray
Him
237730	one
237732	of
237734	the
Twelve
And
237738	after
these things
was walking
237742	-
Jesus
237745	in
237747	-
Galilee
not
for
He did desire
237753	in
237755	-
Judea
to walk
because
were seeking
Him
237762	the
Jews
to kill
Was
now
near
237769	the
237771	feast
237773	of the
Jews
237776	of
Booths
Said
therefore
237781	to
Him
237784	the
237786	brothers
of Him
Depart
from here
and
go
237793	into
237795	-
Judea
so that
237799	also
237801	the
237803	disciples
of You
will see
237807	the
237809	works
of You
that
You are doing
No one
for
anything
237817	in
secret
does
and
seeks
himself
237824	in
public
to be
If
these things
You do
show
Yourself
237833	to the
world
Not even
for
237838	the
237840	brothers
of Him
were believing
237844	in
Him
Says
therefore
to them
237850	-
Jesus
237853	The
237855	time
237857	-
of Me
not yet
is come
237862	-
but
237865	the time
237867	-
of you
always
is
ready
Not
is able
237875	the
world
to hate
you
Me
however
it hates
because
I
bear witness
237886	concerning
it
that
237890	the
237892	works
of it
evil
are
You
go up
237899	to
237901	the
feast
I
not
am going up
237907	to
237910	the
feast
this
for
237915	-
237917	My
time
not yet
has been fulfilled
These things
now
having said
to them
He remained
237927	in
237929	-
Galilee
When
however
had gone up
237935	the
237937	brothers
of Him
237940	to
237942	the
feast
then
237946	also
He
went up
not
openly
but
237953	as
237955	in
secret
237958	The
therefore
Jews
were seeking
Him
237964	at
237966	the
feast
and
were saying
Where
is
He
And
237975	murmuring
237977	about
Him
there was
much
237982	among
237984	the
crowds
Some
indeed
were saying
-
Good
He is
Others
however
were saying
No
but
He deceives
237999	the
people
No one
however
publicly
was speaking
238006	about
Him
238009	because of
238011	the
238013	fear
238015	of the
Jews
Now
also
238020	of the
feast
being in the middle
went up
Jesus
238026	into
238028	the
temple
and
was teaching
Were marveling
then
238035	the
Jews
saying
How
this one
writings
knows
not
having studied
Answered
therefore
them
Jesus
and
said
238051	-
238053	My
teaching
not
is
of Myself
but
of the [One]
having sent
Me
If
anyone
desires
238066	the
238068	will
of Him
to do
he will know
238073	concerning
238075	the
teaching
whether
238079	from
238081	-
God
it is
or
I
238087	from
Myself
speak
The [one]
238092	from
himself
speaking
238096	the
238098	glory
238100	the
own
seeks
the [One]
however
seeking
238107	the
238109	glory
of the [One]
having sent
Him
He
true
is
and
unrighteousness
238119	in
Him
not
is
Not
Moses
has given
to you
238128	the
law
and
238132	no one
238134	of
you
keeps
238138	the
law
Why
Me
do you seek
to kill
Answered
238146	the
crowd
A demon
You have
who
You
seeks
to kill
Answered
Jesus
and
said
to them
238160	One
work
I did
and
all
you marvel
238167	Because of
the fact that
Moses
has given
you
238173	-
circumcision
not
that
238178	of
238180	-
Moses
it is
but
238185	of
238187	the
fathers
also
238191	on
Sabbath
you circumcise
a man
If
circumcision
receives
a man
238200	on
Sabbath
so that
not
might be broken
238206	the
238208	law
of Moses
with Me
are you angry
because
238214	entirely
a man
sound
I made
238219	on
the Sabbath
Not
judge
238224	according to
appearance
but
238228	the
238230	righteous
judgment
judge
Were saying
therefore
238236	some
238238	of
238240	those
of Jerusalem
Not
this
is he
whom
they seek
to kill
And
behold
publicly
He speaks
and
nothing
to Him
they say
not
ever
Truly
have recognized
238261	the
rulers
that
this
is
238267	the
Christ
But
this [man]
we know
from where
He is
238275	The
however
Christ
whenever
He may come
no one
knows
from where
He is
Cried out
therefore
238287	in
238289	the
temple
teaching
238293	-
Jesus
and
saying
Me
you know
and
you know
from where
I am
and
238305	of
Myself
not
I have come
but
is
true
the [One]
having sent
Me
whom
you
not
know
But I
know
Him
because
238324	from
Him
I am
and He
Me
sent
They were seeking
therefore
Him
to take
but
no one
laid
238338	upon
Him
238341	the
hand
because
not yet
had come
238347	the
238349	hour
of Him
238352	Out of
238354	the
crowd
now
many
believed
238360	in
Him
and
were saying
238365	The
Christ
When
He comes
not
238371	more
signs
will He do
than
this [man]
has done
Heard
238379	the
Pharisees
238382	the
crowd
murmuring
238386	about
Him
these things
and
sent
238392	the
chief priests
and
238396	the
Pharisees
officers
that
they might seize
Him
Said
therefore
238405	-
Jesus
Yet
238409	time
a little
238412	with
you
I am
and
I go
238418	to
the [One]
having sent
Me
You will seek
Me
and
not
will find
and
where
am
I
you
not
are able
to come
Said
therefore
238438	the
Jews
238441	among
themselves
Where
He
is about
to go
that
we
not
will find
Him
Not
238454	to
238456	the
238458	Dispersion
238460	among the
Greeks
is He about
to go
and
to teach
238467	the
Greeks
What
is
238473	the
word
this
that
He said
You will seek
Me
and
not
will find
and
Where
am
I
you
not
are able
to come
238492	In
now
238495	the
238497	last
day
238500	the
238502	great [day]
238504	of the
feast
stood
238508	-
Jesus
and
cried out
saying
If
anyone
thirsts
let him come
238518	to
Me
and
drink
The [one]
believing
238525	in
Me
as
has said
238530	the
Scripture
238533	Rivers
238535	out of
238537	the
238539	belly
of him
will flow
238543	of water
living
This
now
He said
238549	concerning
238551	the
Spirit
whom
were about
to receive
those
having believed
238559	in
Him
not yet [given]
for
was
[the] Spirit
because
Jesus
not yet
was glorified
238570	[Some] of
238572	the
crowd
therefore
having heard
238578	the
words
these
were saying
This
is
truly
238586	the
Prophet
Others
were saying
This
is
238593	the
Christ
Others
however
were saying
Not
indeed
238601	out of
238603	-
Galilee
238606	the
Christ
comes
Not
238611	the
Scripture
has said
that
238616	out of
238618	the
238620	seed
of David
and
238624	from
Bethlehem
238627	the
village
where
was
David
comes
238634	the
Christ
A division
therefore
occurred
238640	in
238642	the
crowd
238645	because of
Him
238648	Some
now
desired
238652	of
them
to seize
Him
but
no one
laid
238660	on
Him
238663	the
hands
Came
therefore
238668	the
officers
238671	to
238673	the
chief priests
and
Pharisees
and
said
to them
that
238682	Because of
why
not
did you bring
Him
Answered
238689	the
officers
Never
spoke
like this
a man
as
238697	this
speaks
238700	-
man
Answered
therefore
them
238706	the
Pharisees
Not
238710	also
you
have been deceived
Not
238715	any
238717	of
238719	the
rulers
has believed
238723	on
Him
or
238727	of
238729	the
Pharisees
But
238734	the
crowd
this
-
not
knowing
238741	the
law
accursed
are
Says
Nicodemus
238748	to
them
the [one]

238753	to
Him
former
238757	one
being
238760	of
them
Not
238764	the
238766	law
of us
does judge
238770	the
man
if
not
it has heard
first
238777	from
him
and
known
what
he does
They answered
and
said
to him
Not
238789	also
you
238792	from
238794	-
Galilee
are
Search
and
see
that
238802	out of
238804	-
Galilee
a prophet
not
is raised
And
went
each
238813	to
238815	the
238817	home
of him
Jesus
however
went
238823	to
238825	the
238827	Mount
238829	-
of Olives
Early in the morning
then
again
He came
238836	into
238838	the
temple
and
238842	all
238844	the
people
were coming
238848	to
Him
And
having sat down
He was teaching
them
Bring
now
238857	the
scribes
and
238861	the
Pharisees
238864	to
Him
238867	a woman
238869	in
adultery
having been caught
and
having set
her
238876	in
[the] midst
they say
to Him
Teacher
238882	this
238884	-
woman
was caught
in the very act
committing adultery
238890	In
now
238893	the
law
Moses
us
commanded
238899	-
such
to be stoned
You
therefore
what
say You
This
now
they were saying
testing
Him
so that
they might have [grounds]
to accuse
Him
238916	-
But
Jesus
down
having stooped
238922	with
[His] finger
began writing
238926	on
238928	the
ground
As
however
they continued
asking
Him
having lifted Himself up
also
238938	He said
to them
238941	The [one]
238943	sinless
among you
the first
238947	-
stone
238950	at
her
let him cast
And
again
down
having stooped
He continued to write
238959	on
238961	the
ground
-
And
having heard
and
238968	by
238970	[their]
conscience
being convicted
they began to go away
238975	one
by
having begun
238979	from
238981	the
elder ones
238984	until
238986	the
last
and
He was left
alone
238992	-
Jesus
and
238996	the
woman
238999	in
[the] midst
being
Having lifted up
then
239005	-
Jesus
and
no one
saw
239011	but
239013	the
woman
said
to her
239018	-
Woman
where
are
239023	they
239025	who
239027	accuse
you
No one
you
has condemned
-
And
she said
No one
Sir
Said
then
to her
239041	-
Jesus
Neither
I
you
do condemn
go
and
no more
sin
Again
therefore
to them
spoke
239056	-
Jesus
saying
I
am
239062	the
239064	light
239066	of the
world
the [one]
following
Me
239072	no
not
shall walk
239076	in
239078	the
darkness
but
will have
239083	the
239085	light
239087	-
of life
Said
therefore
to Him
239093	the
Pharisees
You
239097	concerning
Yourself
are bearing witness
239101	the
239103	testimony
of You
not
is
true
Answered
Jesus
and
said
to them
Even if
I
am bearing witness
239117	concerning
Myself
true
is
239122	the
239124	testimony
of Me
because
I know
from where
I came
and
where
I am going
You
however
not

from where
I come
or
where
I am going
You
239144	according to
239146	the
flesh

I
not
am judging
no one
And
if

however
I

239161	judgment
239163	-
My
true
is
because
alone
not
I am
but
I
and
the
having sent
Me
239178	And
239180	in
239182	the
239184	law
also
239187	-
of you
it has been written
that
239193	of two
men
239196	the
testimony
true
is
I
am
the [One]
bearing witness
239205	concerning
Myself
and
bears witness
239210	concerning
Me
239213	the
239215	having sent
Me
Father
They were saying
therefore
to Him
Where
is
239224	the
239226	Father
of You
Answered
Jesus
Neither
Me
you know
nor
239235	the
239237	Father
of Me
If
Me
you had known
239243	also
239245	the
239247	Father
of Me
-
you would have known
239252	These
239254	-
words
He spoke
239258	in
239260	the
treasury
teaching
239264	in
239266	the
temple
and
no one
seized
Him
for
not yet
had come
239276	the
239278	hour
of Him
He said
then
again
to them
I
am going away
and
you will seek
Me
and
239291	in
239293	the
239295	sin
of you
you will die
where
I
go
you
not
are able
to come
Were saying
therefore
239308	the
Jews
Not
will He kill
Himself
that
He says
Where
I
go
you
not
are able
to come
And
He was saying
to them
You
239327	from
239329	-

therefore
to you
that
you will die
239364	in
239366	the
239368	sins
of you
if
for
not
you believe
that
I
am [He]
you will die
239379	in

to them
239394	-
Jesus
239397	From the
beginning
-
what
also
I am saying
to you
Many things
I have
239407	concerning
you
to say
and
to judge
but
the [One]

Me
true
is

what
I have heard
239422	from
Him
these things

239429	the
world
Not
they understood
that
239435	[about] the
Father
to them
He was speaking
Said
therefore
239442	-
Jesus
When
you shall have lifted up
239447	the
239449	Son
239451	-
of Man
then
you will know
that
I
am [He]
and
239460	from
Myself
I do
nothing
but
as
taught
Me
239469	the
Father
these things
I speak
And
the [One]
having sent
Me
239478	with
Me
is
not
He has left
Me
alone
because

to you
if
anyone
239980	-
239982	My
word
keeps
death
239987	never
not
shall he see
239991	to
239993	the
age
Said
to Him
239998	the
Jews
Now
we know
that
a demon
You have
Abraham
died
and
240009	the
prophets
and
You
say
If
anyone
240017	the
240019	word
of Me
keeps
240023	never
not
shall he taste
of death
240028	to
240030	the
age
Not
You
greater than
are
240037	the
240039	father
of us
Abraham
who
died
And
240046	the
prophets
died
Whom
yourself
make You
Answered
Jesus
If
I
glorify
Myself
240059	the
240061	glory
of Me
nothing
is
it is
240067	the
240069	Father
of Me
-
glorifying
Me
[of] whom
you
say
-
240079	God
of us
He is
And
not
you have known
Him
I
however
know
Him
And if
I say
that
not
I know
Him
I will be
240099	like
you
a liar
But
I know
Him
and
240107	the
240109	word
of Him
I keep
Abraham
240114	the
240116	father
of you
rejoiced
in that
he should see
240122	-
240124	day
240126	-
My
and
he saw
and
rejoiced
Said
therefore
240135	the
Jews
240138	to
Him
240141	Fifty
years [old]
not yet
are You
and
Abraham
You have seen
Said
to them
Jesus
Truly
truly
I say
to you
before
Abraham
was
I
am
They took up
therefore
stones
that
they might cast
240166	at
Him
Jesus
however
hid Himself
and
went forth
240174	out of
240176	the
temple
And
passing by
He saw
240182	a man
240184	blind
240186	from
birth
And
asked
Him
240192	the
240194	disciples
of Him
saying
Rabbi
who
sinned
this [man]
or
240203	the
240205	parents
of him
that
blind
he should be born
Answered
Jesus
Neither
this [man]
sinned
nor
240217	the
240219	parents
of him
but
[it was] that
should be displayed
240225	the
240227	works
240229	-
of God
240232	in
him
Us
it behooves
to work
240238	the
240240	works
of the [One]
having sent
Me
while
day
it is
is coming
night
when
no one
is able
to work
While
240255	in
240257	the
world
I shall be
240261	[the] light
I am
240264	of the
world
These things
having said
He spat
on [the] ground
and
made
clay
240274	of
240276	the
spittle
and
applied
240281	to him
240283	the
clay
240286	to
240288	the
eyes
And
He said
to him
Go
wash
240296	in
240298	the
240300	pool
240302	-
of Siloam
which
means
Sent
He went
therefore
and
washed
and
came [back]
seeing
240315	The
therefore
neighbors
and
those
having seen
him
240323	-
before
that
a beggar
he was
were saying
Not
this
is
he who
was sitting
and
begging
Some
were saying
-
He
it is
but others
were saying
No
but
like
him
he is
He
kept saying
-
I
am [he]
They were saying
therefore
to him
How
then
were opened
240360	of you
240362	the
eyes
Answered
He
240367	The
man
-
called
Jesus
clay
made
and
anointed
240377	of me
240379	the
eyes
and
He said
to me
-
Go
240387	to
240389	-
Siloam
and
wash
Having gone
therefore
and
having washed
I received sight
And
they said
to him
Where
is
He
He says
Not
I know
They bring
240409	him
240411	to
240413	the
Pharisees
240416	who
240418	once [was]
blind
Was
now
Sabbath
240424	in
240426	which
day
240429	the
clay
had made
240433	-
Jesus
and
opened
240438	of him
240440	the
eyes
Again
therefore
were asking
him
240447	also
240449	the
Pharisees
how
he had received sight
-
And
he said
to them
Clay
He put
240461	of me
on
240464	the
eyes
and
I washed
and
I see
Were saying
therefore
240474	of
240476	the
Pharisees
some
Not
is
240482	this
240484	from
God
240487	the
man
for
240491	the
Sabbath
not
He does keep
Others
were saying
How
is able
240500	a man
sinful
240503	such
signs
to do
And
division
there was
240510	among
them
They say
therefore
240515	to the
blind [man]
again
What
you
say
240522	concerning
Him
for
He opened
240527	of you
240529	the
eyes
-
And
he said
-
A prophet
He is
Not
did believe
then
240541	the
Jews
240544	concerning
him
that
he had been
blind
and
had received sight
240552	until
when
they called
240556	the
240558	parents
of him
-
having received sight
And
they asked
them
saying
This
is
240569	the
240571	son
of you
of whom
you
say
that
blind
he was born
How
then
does he see
presently
Answered
therefore
240586	the
240588	parents
of him
and
said
We know
that
this
is
240597	the
240599	son
of us
and
that
blind
he was born
How
however
presently
he sees
not
we know
or
who
opened
240615	of him
240617	the
eyes
we
not
know
him
ask
age
has
He
240628	Concerning
himself
he will speak
These things
said
240634	the
240636	parents
of Him
because
they were afraid
240641	of the
Jews
already
for
had agreed together
240647	the
Jews
that
if
anyone
Him
should confess
Christ
expelled from the synagogue
he would be
240658	Because of
this
240661	the
240663	parents
of him
said
-
Age
he has
him
ask
They called
therefore
240674	the
man
240677	out
a second time
who
had been
blind
and
said
to him
Give
glory
240688	-
to God
We
know
that
240694	this
240696	-
man
a sinner
is
Answered
then
he
Whether
a sinner
He is
not
I know
One [thing]
I do know
that
blind
being
now
I see
They said
therefore
to him
What
did He
to you
How
opened He
240724	of you
240726	the
eyes
He answered
them
I told
you
already
and
not
you did listen
Why
again
do you wish
to hear
Not
240742	also
you
do wish
240746	His
disciples
to become
And
they railed at
him
and
said
You
240756	a disciple
are
of that One
we
however
240763	-
of Moses
are
disciples
We
know
that
to Moses
has spoken
240773	-
God
this [man]
however
not
we know
from where
is
Answered
240783	the
man
and
said
to them
240789	In
this
for
240793	-
an amazing thing
is
that
you
not
know
from where
He is
and yet
He opened
240805	my
240807	-
eyes
We know
that
240812	-
God
sinners
not
does hear
but
if
anyone
God-fearing
is
and
240824	the
240826	will
of Him
does
him
He hears
240832	Out of
240834	the
age
never
it has been heard
that
opened
anyone
240842	[the] eyes
240844	of [one] blind
having been born
If
not
were
this [man]
240851	from
God
not
He could
do
nothing
They answered
and
said
to him
240862	In
sins
you
were born
entirely
and
you
teach
us
And
they cast
him
out
Heard
Jesus
that
they had cast
him
out
and
having found
him
He said
You
believe
240888	in
240890	the
240892	Son
240894	of
Man
Answered
he
and
said
And
who
is He
Lord
that
I may believe
240907	in
Him
Said
to him
240912	-
Jesus
Both
You have seen
Him
and
the [One]
speaking
240921	with
you
He
is
-
And
he was saying
I believe
Lord
And
he worshiped
Him
And
said
240936	-
Jesus
240939	For
judgment
I
240943	into
240946	the
world
this
came
that
those
not
seeing
may see
and
those
seeing
blind
may become
Heard
240962	of
240964	the
Pharisees
these things
who
240969	with
Him
were
and
they said
to Him
Not
240977	also
we
blind
are
Said
to them
240984	-
Jesus
If
blind
you were
not
-
you would have
sin
since
however
you say
-
We see
240999	the
241001	sin
of you
remains
Truly
truly
I say
to you
the [one]
not
entering in
241012	by
241014	the
door
241017	to
241019	the
241021	fold
241023	of the
sheep
but
climbing up
another way
he
a thief
is
and
a robber
The [one]
however
entering in
241037	by
241039	the
door
241042	shepherd
is
241045	of the
sheep
To him
241049	the
doorkeeper
opens
and
241054	the
sheep
241057	the
241059	voice
of him
hear
and
241064	the
241066	own
sheep
he calls
241070	by
name
and
leads out
them
When
241078	the
own
all
he has brought out
241083	before
them
he goes
and
241088	the
sheep
him
follow
because
they know
241095	the
241097	voice
of him
A stranger
however
241102	in no way
not
they will follow
but
will flee
241108	from
him
because
not
they recognize
241115	-
of strangers
241118	the
voice
241121	This
241123	-
allegory
spoke
to them
241128	-
Jesus
they
however
not
knew
what
it was
that
He was saying
to them
Said
therefore
again
241143	-
Jesus
Truly
truly
I say
to you
-
I
am
241153	the
241155	door

241160	All
who ever

Me
thieves

I
am
241180	the

241183	by
Me
if
anyone
enters in
he will be saved
and
he will go in
and
will go out
and
pasture
will find
241197	The
thief
not
comes
if
not
that
he might steal
and
might kill
and
might destroy
I
came
that
life
they may have
and
abundantly
may have [it]
I
am
241220	the
241222	shepherd
241224	-
good
241227	The
241229	shepherd
241231	-

241234	the
241236	life
of Him
lays down
241240	for
241242	the

241245	the
hired servant
however
not
being
[the] shepherd
whose
not
are
241255	the
sheep
own
sees
241260	the
wolf
coming
and
leaves
241266	the
sheep
and
flees
and
241272	the
wolf
snatches
them
and
scatters
because
a hired servant
he is
and
not
is himself concerned
to him
241286	about
241288	the
sheep
I

I know
241302	-
My own
and
am known

241308	by
Mine
As
knows
Me
241314	the
Father
I also
know
241319	the
Father
and
241323	the
241325	life
of Me
I lay down
241329	for
241331	the
sheep
And
241335	other
sheep
I have
which
not
are
241342	of
241345	the
fold
this
those also
it behooves
Me
to bring
and
241354	the
241356	voice
of Me
they will hear
and
there will be
241362	one
flock
241365	with one
shepherd
241368	Because of
this
Me
241372	the
Father
loves
because
I
lay down
241379	the
241381	life
of Me
that
again
I might take
it
No one
takes
it
241391	from
Me
but
I
lay down
it
241398	of
Myself
Authority
I have
to lay down
it
and
authority
I have
again
to take
it
241411	This
241413	-
commandment
I received
241417	from
241419	the
241421	Father
of Me
Division
again
there was
241427	among
241429	the
Jews
241432	on account of
241435	the
words
these
Were saying
now
241441	many
241443	of
them
A demon
He has
and
is insane
why
Him
do you listen to
Others
were saying
241455	These
241457	-
sayings
not
are [those]
of one possessed by a demon
Not
a demon
is able
241466	of [the] blind
[the] eyes
to open
Took place
at the time
241472	the
Feast of Dedication
241475	at
241477	-
Jerusalem
Winter
it was
and
was walking

temple
241492	in
241494	the
241496	porch
241498	-
of Solomon
Encircled
therefore
Him
241504	the
Jews
and
they were saying
to Him
241510	Until
when
241513	the
241515	soul
of us
hold You in suspense
If
You
are
241522	the
Christ
tell
us
plainly
Answered
them
241530	-
Jesus
I told
you
and
not
you believe
241538	The
works
that
I
do
241544	in
241546	the
241548	name
241550	of the
241552	Father
of Me
these
bear witness
241557	concerning
Me
But
you
not
believe
because
not
you are
241567	from among
241569	the
241571	sheep

and I
know
them
and
they follow
Me
and I
give
them
241598	life
eternal
and
241602	never
not
shall they perish
241606	to
241608	the
age

never

anyone

Him
241691	the
Jews
241694	For
241696	a good
work

You

Not

241746	-
of God
came
and

Scripture
[of Him] whom
241758	the
Father
sanctified
and
sent
241764	into
241766	the
world
you
do say
-
You blaspheme
because
I said
241775	Son

not

They were seeking
therefore
Him
again
to seize
but
He went forth
241831	out of
241833	the
241835	hand
of them
And
He departed
again
241841	beyond
241843	the
Jordan
241846	to
241848	the
place
where
241852	was
John
241855	-
at first
baptizing
And
He stayed
there
And
many
came
241865	to
Him
and
were saying
-
John
indeed
241873	sign
did
no
241877	everything
however
that
said
John
241883	about
this [man]
true
was
And
many
believed
241891	in
Him
there
Was
now
241898	a certain [man]
ailing
Lazarus
241902	of
Bethany
241905	of
241907	the
241909	village
of Mary
and
Martha
241914	the
241916	sister
of her
Was
now
Mary
the [one]
having anointed
241924	the
Lord
with fragrant oil
and
having wiped
241930	the
241932	feet
of Him
241935	with the
241937	hair
of her
241940	whose
241942	-
brother
Lazarus
was sick
Sent
therefore
241949	the
sisters
241952	to
Him
saying
Lord
behold
[he] whom
You love
is sick
Having heard
then
241963	-
Jesus
said
241967	This
241969	-
sickness
not
is
241974	unto
death
but
241978	for
241980	the
241982	glory
241984	-
of God
that
may be glorified

Martha
and
242008	the
242010	sister
of her
and
242014	-
Lazarus
When
therefore
He heard
that
he is sick
then
indeed
He remained
242025	in
which
He was
[the] place
242030	two
days
Then
242034	after
this
He says
242038	to the
disciples
Let us go
242042	into
242044	-
Judea
again
Say
to Him
242050	the
disciples
Rabbi
just now
were seeking
You
to stone
242058	the
Jews
and
again
You are going
there
Answered
Jesus
Not
242068	twelve
hours
are there
242072	in the
day
If
anyone
walks
242078	in
242080	the
day
not
he stumbles
because
242086	the
242088	light
242091	the
world
of this
he sees
if
however
anyone
walks
242100	in
242102	the
night
he stumbles
because
242107	the
light
not
is
242112	in
him
These things
He said
and
242118	after
this
He says
to them
Lazarus
242124	the
242126	friend
of us
has fallen asleep
but
I go
that
I may awaken
him
Said
therefore
242137	the
disciples
of Him
Lord
if
he has fallen asleep
he will get well
Had spoken
however
242147	-
Jesus
242150	of
242152	the
242154	death
of him
they
however
thought
that
242161	of
242163	the
242165	rest
242167	-
of sleep
He speaks
Then
therefore
said
to them
242175	-
Jesus
plainly
Lazarus
has died
And
I rejoice
242183	for sake of
you
in order that
you might believe
that
not
I was
there
But
let us go
242194	to
him
Said
therefore
Thomas
-
called
Didymus
242203	to the
fellow disciples
Let go
242207	also
us
that
we may die
242212	with
Him
Having come
therefore
242217	-
Jesus
found
him
242222	four
already
days
having been
242227	in
242229	the
tomb
Was
now
Bethany

242237	-
Jerusalem
242240	about
242242	away
242244	stadia
fifteen
242247	Many
now
242250	of
242252	the
Jews
had come
242256	unto
242258	-
Martha
and
Mary
that
they might console
them
242266	concerning
242268	the
brother
242271	-
Therefore
Martha
when
she heard
that
Jesus
is coming
met
Him
Mary
however
242284	in
242286	the
house
was sitting
Said
then
242292	-
Martha
242295	to
Jesus
Lord
if
You had been
here
not
-
would have died
242305	the
242307	brother
of me
even
now
I know
that
whatever
-
You might ask
242317	-
God
will give
You
242322	-
God
Says
to her
242327	-
Jesus
Will rise again
242331	the
242333	brother
of you
Says
to him
242338	-
Martha
I know
that
he will rise again
242344	in
242346	the
resurrection
242349	in
242351	the
242353	last
day
Said
to her
242358	-
Jesus
I
am
242363	the
resurrection
and
242367	the
life
the [one]
believing
242372	in
Me
even if
he should die
he will live
and
242379	everyone
-
living
and
believing
242385	in
Me
242388	never
not
shall die
242392	to
242394	the
age
Believe you
this
She says
to Him
Yes
Lord
I
have believed
that
You
are
242408	the
Christ
242411	the
242413	Son
242415	-
of God
the [One]
242419	into
242421	the
world
coming
And
these things
having said
she went away
and
called
Mary
242432	the
242434	sister
of her
secretly
having said
242439	The
Teacher
is come
and
He calls
you
She
then
when
she heard
rose up
quickly
and
was coming
242454	to
Him
Not yet
now
had come
242460	-
Jesus
242463	into
242465	the
village
but
was
still
242471	in
242473	the
place
where
had met
Him
242479	-
Martha
242482	The
then
Jews
-
being
242488	with
her
242491	in
242493	the
house
and
consoling
her
having seen
242500	-
Mary
that
quickly
she rose up
and
went out
followed
her
having supposed
-
she is going
242513	to
242515	the
tomb
that
she might weep
there
242521	-
Therefore
Mary
when
she came
to where
was
Jesus
having seen
Him
fell
242534	of Him
at
242537	the
feet
saying
to Him
Lord
if
You had been
here
not
-
242548	of me
would have died
242551	the
brother
Jesus
therefore
when
He saw
her
weeping
and
242561	the
242563	having come with
her
Jews
weeping
He was deeply moved
242569	-
in spirit
and
troubled
Himself
And
He said
Where
have you laid
him
They say
to Him
Lord
come
and
see
Wept
242587	-
Jesus
Were saying
therefore
242592	the
Jews
Behold
how
He loved
him
242599	Some
however
242602	of
them
said
Not
was able
242608	this [man]
-
having opened
242612	the
242614	eyes
242616	of the
blind
to have caused
that
242621	also
this one
not
should have died
Jesus
therefore
again
being deeply moved
242630	in
Himself
comes
242634	to
242636	the
tomb
It was
now
a cave
and
a stone
was lying
242645	against
it
Says
242649	-
Jesus
Take away
242653	the
stone
Says
to Him
242658	the
242660	sister
of the [one]
having died
Martha
Lord
already
he stinks
four days
for
it is
Says
to her
242673	-
Jesus
Not
said I
to you
that
if
you should believe
you will see
242683	the
242685	glory
242687	-
of God
They took away
therefore
242692	the
stone
242695	-
Now
Jesus
lifted
242700	His
eyes
upwards
and
said
Father
I thank
You
that
You have heard
Me
I
and
knew
that
always
Me
You hear
but
242720	on account of
242722	the
crowd
-
standing around
I said [it]
that
they may believe
that
You
Me
sent
And
these things
having said
242737	in a voice
loud
He cried out
Lazarus
come
forth
Came forth
the [one]
having been dead
being bound
242748	the
feet
and
242752	the
hands
with linen strips
and
242757	the
242759	face
of him
in a headcloth
bound about
Says
to them
242766	-
Jesus
Unbind
him
and
allow
him
to go
242775	Many
therefore
242778	of
242780	the
Jews
-
having come
242785	to
242787	-
Mary
and
having seen
what
He did
believed
242795	in
Him
242798	some
however
242801	of
them
went
242805	to
242807	the
Pharisees
and
told
them
what
had done
Jesus
Gathered
therefore
242818	the
chief priests
and
242822	the
Pharisees
a council
and
they were saying
What
are we to do
For
242831	this
242833	-
man
242836	many
does
signs
If
we shall let him alone
Him
like this
all
will believe
242846	in
Him
and
will come
242851	the
Romans
and
will take away
242856	of us
both
242859	the
place
and
242863	the
nation
242867	One
however
certain
242871	of
them
Caiaphas
high priest
being
242878	the
year
same
said
to them
You
not
know
nothing
nor
consider you
that
it is profitable
for you
that
242894	one
man
should die
242898	for
242900	the
people
and
not
242905	all
242907	the
nation
should perish
This
now
242913	from
himself
not
he said
but
high priest
being
242922	the
year
that
he prophesied
that
was about
Jesus
to die
242931	for
242933	the
nation
and
not
242938	for
242940	the
nation
only
but
that
242946	also
242948	the
242950	children
242952	-
of God
those
having been scattered
He might gather together
242958	into
one
242961	From
242963	that
therefore
242966	-
day
they took counsel together
that
they might kill
Him
242973	-
Therefore
Jesus
no longer
publicly
walked
242980	among
242982	the
Jews
but
went away
from there
242988	into
242990	the
242992	region
242994	near
242996	the
wilderness
242999	to
243001	Ephraim
called
a city
And there
He stayed
243007	with
243009	the
disciples
Was
now
near
243015	the
243017	Passover
243019	of the
Jews
and
went up
many
243025	to
Jerusalem
243028	out of
243030	the
region
243033	before
243035	the
Passover
so that
they might purify
themselves
They were seeking
therefore
243043	-
Jesus
and
were saying
243048	among
one another
243051	in
243053	the
temple
standing
What
does it seem
to you
that
243061	no
not
He will come
243065	to
243067	the
feast
Had given
now
243072	the
chief priests
and
243076	the
Pharisees
a command
that
if
anyone
should know
where
He is
he should show [it]
so that
they might seize
Him
243090	-
Therefore
Jesus
243094	before
243096	six
243098	days
243100	the
Passover
came
243104	to
Bethany
where
was
Lazarus
whom
had raised
243112	out from
[the] dead
Jesus
They made
therefore
Him
a supper
there
and
243122	-
Martha
was serving
243126	-
and
Lazarus
243130	one
was
243133	of
those
reclining
243137	with
Him
243140	-
Therefore
Mary
having taken
243145	a litra
243149	of fragrant oil
of nard
pure
of great price
anointed
243155	the
243157	feet
243159	-
of Jesus
and
wiped
243164	with the
243166	hair
of her
243169	the
243171	feet
of Him
243174	the
now
house
was filled
243179	with
243181	the
243183	fragrance
243185	of the
oil
Says
however
Judas
243191	-
Iscariot
243194	one
243196	the
243198	disciples
of Him
-
being about
Him
to betray
243205	Because of
why
243208	this
243210	-
fragrant oil
not
was sold
243215	for three hundred
denarii
and
given
to [the] poor
He said
however
this
not
because
243226	for
243228	the
poor
he was caring
to him
but
because
a thief
he was
and
243238	the
money bag
having
that
being put into [it]
he used to pilfer
Said
therefore
243247	-
Jesus
Leave alone
her
so that
243253	for
243255	the
243257	day
243259	of the
243261	burial
of Me
she may keep
it
243266	the
poor
for
always
you have
243272	with
you
Me
however
not
always
you have
Knew
therefore
243282	-
243285	a crowd
great
243288	of
243290	the
Jews
that
there
He is
and
they came
not
243299	because of
243301	-
Jesus
only
but
that
also
243308	-
Lazarus
they might see
whom
He had raised
243314	out from
[the] dead
Took counsel
however
243319	the
chief priests
that
243323	also
243325	-
Lazarus
they might kill
because
243330	many
243332	on account of
him
were going away
243336	of the
Jews
and
were believing
243341	in
243343	-
Jesus
243346	On the
next day
243350	the
crowd
great
-
having come
243356	to
243358	the
feast
having heard
that
is coming
Jesus
243365	into
Jerusalem
took
243369	the
243371	branches
243373	of the
palm trees
and
went out
243378	to
243380	meet
Him
and
were shouting
Hosanna
Blessed is
the [One]
coming
243389	in
243391	[the] name
of [the] Lord
And
243395	the
243397	King
243399	-
of Israel
Having found
then
243404	-
Jesus
a young donkey
He sat
243409	upon
it
as
243413	it is
written
Not
fear
243418	daughter
of Zion
Behold
243422	the
243424	King
of you
comes
sitting
243429	on
243431	a colt
of a donkey
These things
not
knew
243437	of Him
243439	the
disciples
243442	from the
first
but
when
was glorified
Jesus
then
they remembered
that
these things
243453	were
243455	of
Him
written
and
these things
they had done
to Him
Continued to bear witness
therefore
243465	the
crowd
-
being
243470	with
Him
when
243474	-
Lazarus
He called
243478	out of
243480	the
tomb
and
raised
him
243486	out from
[the] dead
243489	On account of
this
also
met
Him
243495	the
crowd
because
they heard
this
of His
having done
243503	the
sign
243506	-
Therefore
the Pharisees
said
243511	among
themselves
You see
that
not
you gain
nothing
Behold
243520	the
world
243523	after
Him
has gone
There were
now
243529	Greeks
certain
243532	among
those
coming up
that
they might worship
243538	at
243540	the
feast
these
therefore
came
to Philip
243547	who was
243549	from
243551	Bethsaida
243553	-
of Galilee
and
they were asking
him
saying
Sir
we desire
243562	-
Jesus
to see
Comes
243567	-
Philip
and
tells
243572	-
Andrew
come
Andrew
and
Philip
and
tell
243581	-
Jesus
243584	-
And
Jesus
answered
them
saying
Has come
243592	the
hour
that
should be glorified
243597	the
243599	Son
243601	-
of Man
Truly
truly
I say
to you
if
not
243610	the
243612	grain
243614	-
of wheat
having fallen
243618	into
243620	the
ground
should die
it
alone
abides
if
however
it should die
243630	much
fruit
it bears
The [one]
loving
243636	the
243638	life
of him
loses
it
and
the [one]
hating
243646	the
243648	life
of him
243651	in
243654	the
world
this
243658	to
243660	life
eternal
will keep
it
If
Me
anyone
serves
Me
let him follow
and
where
am
I
there
243676	also
243678	the
243680	servant
243682	-
of Me
will be
If
anyone
Me
serves
will honor
him
243692	the
Father
Now
243696	the
243698	soul
of Me
has been troubled
and
what
shall I say
Father
save
Me
243708	from
243711	the
hour
this
But
243716	on account of
this
I came
243720	to
243723	the
hour
this
Father
glorify
243729	of You
243731	the
name
Came
therefore
a voice
243737	from
243739	-
heaven
Both
I have glorified [it]
and
again
I will glorify [it]
243747	-
Therefore
the crowd
-
having stood
and
having heard
was saying
Thunder
there has been
Others
were saying
An angel
to Him
has spoken
Answered
Jesus
and
said
Not
243768	because of
Me
243772	the
voice
this
has come
but
243778	because of
you
Now
243782	[the] judgment
is
243786	the
world
of this
now
243791	the
243793	prince
243796	of the
world
this
will be cast
out
And I
if
I am lifted up
243805	from
243807	the
earth
all
will draw
243812	to
Myself
This
now
He was saying
signifying
243819	by what
death
He was about
to die
Answered
then
Him
243827	the
crowd
We
have heard
243832	from
243834	the
law
that
243838	the
Christ
abides
243842	to
243844	the
age
and
how
say
you
that
it behooves
to be lifted up
243854	the
243856	Son
243858	-
of Man
Who
is
243863	this
243865	-
243867	Son
243869	-
of Man
Said
therefore
to them
243875	-
Jesus
Yet
243879	a little
while
243882	the
light
243885	with
you
is
Walk
while
243891	the
light
you have
so that
not
darkness
you
might overtake
And
the [one]
walking
243903	in
243905	the
darkness
not
knows
where
he is going
While
243913	the
light
you have
believe
243918	in
243920	the
light
so that
243924	sons
of light
you may become
These things
spoke
Jesus
and
having gone away
He was hidden
243934	from
them
243937	So many
however
of Him
signs
having been done
243943	before
them
not
they believed
243948	in
Him
so that
243952	the
243954	word
of Isaiah
243957	the
prophet
might be fulfilled
that
said
Lord
who
has believed
243966	the
243968	report
of us
And
243972	the
243974	arm
of [the] Lord
to whom
has been revealed
243979	Because of
this
not
they were able
to believe
for
again
said
Isaiah
He has blinded
243990	of them
243992	the
eyes
and
has hardened
243997	of them
243999	the
heart
that
not
they should see
244005	with the
eyes
and
understand
244010	with the
heart
and
turn
and
I will heal
them
These things
said
Isaiah
because
he saw
244023	the
244025	glory
of Him
and
spoke
244030	concerning
Him
Nevertheless
indeed
244035	even
244038	of
244040	the
rulers
many
believed
244045	in
Him
but
244049	on account of
244051	the
Pharisees
not
they were confessing
so that
not
put out of the synagogue
they might be
they loved
for
244062	the
244064	glory
244066	-
of men
more
than
244071	the
244073	glory
244075	-
of God
Jesus
then
cried out
and
said
The [one]
believing
244085	in
Me
not
believes
244090	in
Me
but
244094	in
the [One]
having sent
Me
and
the [one]
beholding
Me
beholds
the [One]
having sent
Me
I
a light
244109	into
244111	the
world
have come
so that
244116	everyone
-
believing
244120	in
Me
244123	in
244125	the
darkness
not
should abide
And
if
anyone
244133	of Me
hears
244136	the
words
and
not
keeps [them]
I
not
do judge
him
not
for
I came
that
I might judge
244151	the
world
but
that
I might save
244157	the
world
The [one]
rejecting
Me
and
not
receiving
244166	the
244168	words
of Me
has
[one]
judging
him
244175	The
word
which
I spoke
that
will judge
him
244183	in
244185	the
244187	last
day
For
I
244192	from
Myself
not
spoke
but
244198	the
244200	having sent
Me
Father
Himself
Me
a commandment
gave
what
I should say
and
what
I should speak
And
I know
that
244216	the
244218	commandment
of Him
244221	life
eternal
is
What
therefore
I
speak
as
has said
to Me
244232	the
Father
so
I speak
244237	Before
now
244240	the
244242	feast
244244	of the
Passover
knowing
244248	-
Jesus
that
had come
244253	His
244255	-
hour
that
He would depart
244260	out of
244263	the
world
this
244267	to
244269	the
Father
having loved
244273	the
own
244276	who [were]
244278	in
244280	the
world
244283	to
[the] end
He loved
them
And
supper
taking place
244291	the
devil
already
having put
244296	into
244298	the
heart
that
he should betray
Him
244304	of Judas
[son] of Simon
Iscariot
knowing
that
all things
has given
Him
244313	the
Father
244316	into
244318	the
hands
and
that
244323	from
God
He came forth
and
244328	to
244330	-
God
He is going
He rises
244335	from
244337	the
supper
and
lays aside
244342	the
garments
And
having taken
a towel
He girded
Himself
After that
He pours
water
244353	into
244355	the
basin
and
He began
to wash
244361	the
244363	feet
244365	of the
disciples
and
to wipe [them]
244370	with the
towel
with which
244374	He was
girded
He comes
then
244379	to
Simon
Peter
who says
to Him
Lord
You
244387	of me
do wash
244390	the
feet
Answered
Jesus
and
said
to him
What
I
do
you
not
know
presently
you will know
however
244407	after
these things
Says
to Him
Peter
244413	No
not
shall You wash
244417	of me
244419	the
feet
244422	to
244424	the
age
Answered
Jesus
him
If
not
I wash
you
not
you have
part
244437	with
Me
Says
to Him
Simon
Peter
Lord
not
244446	the
244448	feet
of me
only
but
244453	also
244455	the
hands
and
244459	the
head
Says
to him
Jesus
The [one]
having been bathed
not
has
need
if
not
244472	the
feet
to wash
but
is
clean
wholly
and
you all
clean
are
but
not
all
He knew
for
the [one who]
was betraying
Him
244492	on account of
this
He said
-
Not
all
clean
you are
When
therefore
He had washed
244504	the
244506	feet
of them
and
taken
244511	the
244513	garments
of Him
and
having reclined
again
He said
to them
Do you know
what
I have done
to you
You
call
Me
244528	-
Teacher
and
244532	-
Lord
and
rightly
you say
I am
for
If
therefore
I
have washed
244544	your
244546	-
feet
244549	the
Lord
and
244553	the
Teacher
244556	also
you
ought
244560	of one another
to wash
244563	the
feet
A pattern
for
I gave
you
that
as
I
did
to you
244575	also
you
should do
Truly
truly
I say
to you
not
is
a servant
greater than
244587	the
244589	master
of him
nor
a messenger
greater than
the [one]
having sent
him
If
these things
you know
blessed
are you
if
you do
them
Not
244607	about
244609	all
of you
I speak
I
know
whom
I chose
but
that
244619	the
Scripture
may be fulfilled
The [one]
eating
244625	of Me
244627	the
bread
lifted up
244631	against
Me
244634	the
244636	heel
of him
244639	From
this time
I am telling
you
244644	before
-
it comes to pass
so that
you should believe
when
it comes to pass
that
I
am [He]
Truly
truly
I say
to you
the [one]
receiving
-
any
I shall send
Me
receives
the [one]
now
Me
receiving
receives
the [One]
having sent
Me
These things
having said
Jesus
was troubled
244678	-
in spirit
and
He testified
and
said
Truly
truly
I say
to you
that
244690	one
244692	of
you
will betray
Me
Began to look
244698	upon
one another
244701	the
disciples
being uncertain
244705	of
whom
He is speaking
244709	There was
reclining
244712	one
244714	of
244716	the
244718	disciples
of Him
244721	in
244723	the
244725	bosom
244727	-
of Jesus
whom
loved
244732	-
Jesus
Motions
therefore
to him
Simon
Peter
and
he tells
him
to ask
who
is
244746	about
whom
He is speaking
Having leaned
he
thus
244753	on
244755	the
244757	breast
244759	-
of Jesus
he says
to Him
Lord
who
is it
Answers
then
244769	-
Jesus
He
it is
to whom
I
will dip
244777	the
morsel
and
will give
him
Having dipped
then
244785	the
morsel
He takes [it]
and
gives [it]
244791	to Judas
[son] of Simon
Iscariot
And
244796	after
244798	the
morsel
then
entered
244803	into
him
244806	-
Satan
Says
therefore
to him
Jesus
What
you do
do
quickly
This
now
244819	no one
knew
of those
reclining
244824	to
what
He spoke
to him
Some
for
were thinking
since
244833	the
money bag

246037	Greater
than this
love
no one
has
that
one
246045	the

should lay down
246051	for
246053	the
246055	friends
of him
You
246059	friends

are
if
you do
what
I
command
you
No longer
I call
you
servants
for
246074	the
servant
not
knows
what
is doing
246081	his
246083	-

You
however
I have called
friends
because
246091	all things
that
I heard
246095	from
246097	the
246099	Father
of Me
I have made known
to you
Not
you
Me
chose
but
I
chose
you
and
appointed
you
that
you
should go
and
fruit
you should bear
and
246122	the
246124	fruit
of you
should remain
so that
-
what
ever
you might ask
246133	the
Father
246136	in
246138	the
246140	name
of Me
He may give
you
These things
I command
you
that
you love
one another
If
246152	the
world
you
hates
you know
that
Me
246160	before
you
it has hated
If
246165	of
246167	the
world
you were
246171	the
world
-
246175	[as] its
own
would love [you]
because
however
246181	of
246183	the
world
not
you are
but
I
chose
you
246192	out of
246194	the
world
246197	on account of
this
hates
you
246202	the
world
Remember
246206	the
word
that
I
said
to you
Not
is
a servant
greater than
246217	the
246219	master
of him
If
Me
they persecuted
246225	also
you
they will persecute
if
246230	the
246232	word
of Me
they kept
246236	also
246238	-
yours
they will keep
But
246243	these things
all
they will do
246247	against
you
246250	on account of
246252	the
246254	name
of Me
because
not
they have known
the [One]
having sent
Me
If
not
I had come
and
spoken
to them
sin
not
they would have had
now
however
excuse
not
they have
246277	for
246279	the
246281	sin
of them
The [one]
Me
hating
246287	also
246289	the
246291	Father
of Me
hates
If
246296	the
works
not
I had done
246301	among
them
that
246305	no
other
has done
sin
not
they would have had
now
however
both
they have seen
and
have hated
both
Me
and
246321	the
246323	Father
of Me
But [this is]
that
may be fulfilled
246329	the
word
-
246333	in
246335	the
246337	law
of them
having been written
-
They hated
Me
without cause
When
comes
246347	the
Helper
whom
I
will send
to you
246354	from
246356	the
Father
246359	the
246361	Spirit
246363	-
of truth
who
246367	from
246369	the
Father
goes forth
He
will bear witness
246375	concerning
Me
246378	Also
you
now
bear witness
because
246384	from
[the] beginning
246387	with
Me
you are
These things
I have spoken
to you
that
not
you might fall away
Out of the synagogues
they will put
you
but
is coming
an hour
that
246404	everyone
-
having killed
you
will think
[it is] a service
to offer
246412	-
to God
And
these things
they will do
because
not
they know
246421	the
Father
nor
Me
But
these things
I have said
to you
so that
when
might have come
246433	the
246435	hour
of them
you may remember
them
that
I
said [them]
to you
These things
now
to you
246447	from
[the] beginning
not
I said
because
246453	with
you
I was
Now
however
I go
246460	to
the [One]
having sent
Me
and
246466	none
246468	of
you
asks
Me
Where
are You going
But
because
these things
I have said
to you
246480	-
sorrow
has filled
246484	your
246486	-
heart
But
I
246491	the
truth
say
to you
it is profitable
for you
that
I
should go away
If
for
not
I go away
246505	the
Helper
246508	no
not at all
will come
246512	to
you
if
however
I go
I will send
Him
246520	to
you
And
having come
He
will convict
246527	the
world
246530	concerning
sin
and
246534	concerning
righteousness
and
246538	concerning
judgment
246541	concerning
sin
indeed
because
not
do they believe
246548	in
Me
246551	concerning
righteousness
now
because
246556	to
246558	the
Father
I go away
and
no more
you behold
Me
246566	concerning
now
judgment
because
246571	the
246573	ruler
246576	of the
world
this
has been judged
Yet
many things
I have
to you
to say
but
not
you are able
to bear them
now
When
however
shall come
He
246595	the
246597	Spirit
246599	-
of truth
He will guide
you
246604	into
246607	the
truth
all
not
for
He will speak
246614	from
Himself
but
whatever
He may hear
He will speak
and
the things
coming
He will declare
to you
He
Me
will glorify
for
246630	from
246632	that which [is]
Mine
He will take
and
will disclose
to you
246639	All things
whatever
has
246643	the
Father
Mine
are
246648	because of
this
I said
that
246653	from
246655	that which [is]
Mine
He will take
and
will disclose
to you
A little [while]
and
no longer
you do behold
Me
and
again
a little [while]
and
you will see
Me
Said
therefore
246675	[some] of
246677	the
246679	disciples
of him
246682	to
one another
What
is
this
that
He says
to us
A little [while]
and
not
you do behold
Me
and
again
a little [while]
and
you will see
Me
and
Because
I am going
246705	to
246707	the
Father
They were saying
therefore
This
what
is
that
He says
246717	a
little [while]
Not
we do know
what
He is saying
Knew
Jesus
that
they were desiring
Him
to ask
and
He said
to them
246733	Concerning
this
do you inquire
246737	among
one another
that
I said
A little [while]
and
not
you do behold
Me
and
again
a little [while]
and
you will see
Me
Truly
truly
I say
to you
that
will weep
and
will lament
you
246762	-
but
the world
will rejoice
You
will be grieved
but
246770	the
246772	grief
of you
246775	to
joy
will turn
246779	The
woman
when
she is giving birth
pain
has
because
has come
246788	the
246790	hour
of her
when
however
she brings forth
246796	the
child
no longer
she remembers
246801	the
tribulation
246804	on account of
246806	the
joy
that
has been born
a man
246812	into
246814	the
world
246817	Also
you
therefore
now
indeed
grief
have
again
however
I will see
you
and
will rejoice
246831	your
246833	-
heart
and
246837	the
246839	joy
of you
no one
will take
246844	from
you
And
246848	in
246850	that
246852	-
day
of Me
not
you will ask
nothing
Truly
truly
I say
to you
-
whatever
you may ask
246866	the
Father
He will give
you
246871	in
246873	the
246875	name
of Me
246878	Until
now
not
you have asked
nothing
246884	in
246886	the
246888	name
of Me
Ask
and
you will receive
that
246895	the
246897	joy
of you
246900	may be
full
These things
246904	in
allegories
I have spoken
to you
is coming
an hour
when
no more
246913	in
allegories
I will speak
to you
but
plainly
246920	concerning
246922	the
Father
I will report
to you
246927	In
246929	that
246931	-
day
246934	in
246936	the
246938	name
of Me
you will ask
and
not
I say
to you
that
I
will implore
246949	the
Father
246952	for
you
246955	Himself
for
246958	the
Father
loves
you
because
you
Me
have loved
and
have believed
that
I
246971	from
246973	-
God
came forth
I came forth
246978	from
246980	the
Father
and
have come
246985	into
246987	the
world
again
I leave
246992	the
world
and
go
246997	to
246999	the
Father
Say
247003	the
247005	disciples
of Him
Behold
now
247010	in
openness
You speak
and
allegory
not
speak
Now
we know
that
You know
all things
and
not
need
have
that
anyone
You
should ask
247031	In
this
we believe
that
247036	from
God
You came forth
Answered
them
Jesus
Now
do you believe
Behold
is coming
an hour
and
has come
when
you will be scattered
each
247053	to
247055	the
own
and I
alone
you shall leave
yet
not
I am
alone
for
247066	the
Father
247069	with
Me
is
These things
I have spoken
to you
so that
247077	in
Me
peace
you may have
247082	In
247084	the
world
tribulation
you have
But
take courage
I
have overcome
247093	the
world
These things
spoke
Jesus
and
having lifted up
247101	the
247103	eyes
of Him
247106	to
247108	-
heaven
He said
Father
has come
247114	the
hour
glorify
247118	Your
247120	-
Son
that
247124	the
Son
may glorify
You
As
You gave
Him
authority
247133	over all
flesh
so that
247137	all
whom
You have given
Him
He may give
to them
247144	life
eternal
This
now
is
247150	-
247152	eternal
life
that
they may know
You
247158	the
247160	only
247162	true
God
and
whom
You have sent
Jesus
Christ
I
You
glorified
247173	on
247175	the
earth
247178	the
work
having completed
that
You have given
Me
that
I should do
And
now
glorify
Me
You
Father
247193	with
Yourself
247196	with the
glory
that
I had
247201	before
-
247204	the
world
existed
247208	with
You
I revealed
247212	Your
247214	-
name
247217	to the
men
whom
You have given
Me
247223	out of
247225	the
world
Yours
they were
and to Me
them
You gave
and
247234	the
247236	word
of You
they have kept
Now
they have known
that
247243	all things
whatever
You have given
Me
247248	of
You
are
for
247253	the
words
that
You have given
Me
I have given
them
and
they
received [them]
and
knew
truly
that
247268	from
You
I came forth
and
they believed
that
You
Me
sent
I
247279	concerning
them
am praying
Not
247284	concerning
247286	the
world
do I pray
but
247291	concerning
those whom
You have given
Me
for
Yours
they are
And
247301	things
of mine
all
Yours
are
and
247308	-
Yours
Mine
and
I have been glorified
247314	in
them
And
no longer
I am
247320	in
247322	the
world
and yet
themselves
247327	in
247329	the
world
they are
and I
247334	to
You
am coming
247338	Father
Holy
keep
them
247343	in
247345	the
247347	name
of You
which
You have given
Me
that
they may be
one
as
we [are]
When
I was
247360	with
them
I
was keeping
them
247366	in
247368	the
247370	name
of You
which
You have given
Me
And
I guarded [them]
and
247379	none
247381	of
them
has perished
if
not
247387	the
247389	son
247391	-
of destruction
that
247395	the
Scripture
might be fulfilled
Now
however
247401	to
You
I am coming
and
these things
I speak
247408	in
247410	the
world
so that
they may have
247415	-
247417	joy
247419	-
My
fulfilled
247423	within
them
I
have given
them
247429	the
247431	word
of You
and
247435	the
world
hated
them
because
not
they are
247443	of
247445	the
world
even as
I
not
am
247452	of
247454	the
world
Not
I do ask
that
You should take
them
247462	out of
247464	the
world
but
that
You should keep
them
247471	from
247473	-
evil
247476	Of
247478	the
world
not
they are
as
I
not
am
247487	of
247489	the
world
Sanctify
them
247494	by
247496	the
truth
247499	the
247501	word
247503	-
of You
truth
is
As
Me
You sent
247511	into
247513	the
world
I also
sent
them
247519	into
247521	the
world
and
247525	for
them
I
sanctify
Myself
that
247532	may be
247534	also
they
sanctified
247538	in
truth
Not
247542	for
these
however
do I ask
only
but
also
247550	for
those
believing
247554	through
247556	the
247558	word
of them
247561	in
Me
that
all
one
may be
as
You
Father
247571	[are] in
Me
and I
247575	in
You
that
247579	also
they
247582	in
Us
may be
that
247587	the
world
may believe
that
You
Me
sent
And I
247596	the
glory
which
You have given
Me
have given
them
so that
they may be
one
as
We
[are] one
I
247611	in
them
and
You
247616	in
Me
that
247620	they may be
perfected
247623	in
unity
so that
may know
247628	the
world
that
You
Me
sent
and
loved
them
even as
Me
You loved
Father
[those] whom
You have given
Me
I desire
that
where
am
I
they also
may be
247652	with
Me
that
they may behold
247657	-
247659	glory
247661	-
My
that
You gave
Me
because
You loved
Me
247670	before
247672	[the] foundation
of [the] world
247675	Father
righteous
247678	although
247680	the
world
You
not
has known
I
now
You
have known
and
these
have known
that
You
Me
sent
And
I made known
to them
247700	the
247702	name
of You
and
will make [it] known
so that
247708	the
love
with which
You loved
Me
247714	in
them
may be
and I
247719	in
them
These things
having said
Jesus
went out
247726	with
247728	the
247730	disciples
of Him
247733	beyond
247735	the
247737	winter stream
247739	-
of Kidron
where
there was
a garden
247745	into
which
entered
He
and
247751	the
247753	disciples
of Him
Knew
now
247758	also
Judas
who
was delivering up
Him
247764	the
place
because
often
gathered together
Jesus
there
247772	with
247774	the
247776	disciples
of Him
247779	-
Therefore
Judas
having procured
247784	the
cohort
and
247789	from
247791	the
chief priests
and
247795	from
247797	the
Pharisees
officers
comes
there
247803	with
lanterns
and
torches
and
weapons
Jesus
therefore
knowing
247813	all things
that
are coming
247817	upon
Him
having gone forth
also
said
to them
Whom
seek you
They answered
Him
Jesus
247829	of
Nazareth
He says
to them
I
am [He]
Had been standing
now
247838	also
Judas
who
is delivering up
Him
247844	with
them
When
therefore
He said
to them
I
am [He]
they drew
247854	toward
247856	the
back
and
fell
to [the] ground
Again
therefore
He questioned
them
Whom
seek you
-
And
they said
Jesus
247872	of
Nazareth
Answered
Jesus
I have told
you
that
I
am [He]
If
therefore
Me
you seek
Allow
these
to go away
so that
might be fulfilled
247891	the
word
that
He had spoken
-
Those whom
You have given
Me
not
I lost
247903	of
them
not one

then
Peter
having
a sword
drew
it
and
struck
247916	the
247919	of the
high priest
servant
and
cut off
247925	of him

247929	ear

247937	of the
servant

Said
therefore
247943	-
Jesus
247946	-
to Peter
Put
247950	the
sword
247953	into
247955	the
sheath

cup
which
has given
Me
247964	the
Father
no
not
shall I drink
it
247971	-
Then
the cohort
and
247976	the
commander
and
247980	the
247982	officers
247984	of the
Jews
took hold of
247988	-
Jesus
and
bound
Him
and
they led [Him] away
247996	to
Annas
first

for
248002	father-in-law
248004	-
of Caiaphas
who
was

248012	the
year

Was
now
Caiaphas
the [one]

248021	to the
Jews
that
it is profitable
248026	for one
man
to perish
248030	for
248032	the
people
Were following
now

and
248043	the other

248210	the
temple
where
248214	all
248216	the
Jews
come together
and
248221	in
secret
I spoke
nothing
Why
Me
do you question
Question
those
having heard
what
I spoke
to them
behold
they
know
what
said
I
These things

of Him
having said

having said
Thus
answer You
248260	the

Answered
him
Jesus
If

It was

248389	the
Praetorium
so that
not
they should be defiled
but
might eat

Passover
Went
therefore
248402	-
Pilate
out
248406	to
them
and
said
248411	What
248413	accusation

They answered
and
said
to him
If

Said

of Jesus
might be fulfilled
which
He had spoken
signifying

Entered
therefore
again
248486	into

Praetorium
248491	-
Pilate
and
he called

248622	-
Jesus
You

248631	for
this
have been born
and
248636	for

Says
to Him
248667	-

And
this
having said
again
he went out
248678	to
248680	the
Jews
and
says
to them
I
no
find
248689	in
Him
guilt
It is
however
a custom
with you
that
one
I should release
to you
248701	at
248703	the
Passover
wish you
therefore
I should release
to you
248710	the

They cried out
then
again
saying
Not

Was
now

At that time
therefore
took

flogged [Him]
And
248745	the
soldiers
having twisted together
a crown
248750	of
thorns
put [it] on
248754	of Him
248756	the
head
and
248760	a robe
purple
cast around
Him
and
they began coming up
248767	to
Him
and
saying
Hail
248773	-
248775	King
248777	of the
Jews
And
they kept giving
Him
blows with the palm
And
went forth
again
outside
248788	-
Pilate
and
he says
to them
Behold
I bring

Him
out
so that
you may know
that
248802	no

him
248869	the

248876	according to
248878	the
law

When
therefore
heard
248892	-
Pilate
248895	this
248897	-
word
[the] more
he was afraid
And
he went
248904	into
248906	the
Praetorium
again
and
he says
248912	-
to Jesus
From where
are
You
248918	-
But
Jesus
an answer
not
did give
him
Says
therefore
to Him
248929	-

not
248959	it were
given
to you
from above
248964	Because of
this

having delivered up
Me
to you

sin
has
248975	Out of
this
248978	-
Pilate
was seeking
to release
Him
248984	-
but
the Jews
cried out
saying
If
this [man]
you release
not
you are
248995	a friend
248997	-
of Caesar
249000	Everyone
-
a king
himself
making
speaks against
249007	-
Caesar
249010	-
Therefore
Pilate
having heard
249016	the
words
these
brought
out
249022	-
Jesus
and
sat down
249027	upon
[the] judgment seat
249030	at
249032	a place
called
[the] Stone Pavement
in Hebrew
now
Gabbatha
It was
now
249041	the Day of Preparation
249043	of the
Passover
[the] hour
was
249048	about
the sixth
And
he says
249053	to the
Jews
Behold
249057	the
249059	king
of you
They cried out
therefore
With Him
away

Crucify
Him
Says
to them
249071	-
Pilate
249074	The
249076	King
of you
shall I crucify
Answered
249081	the
chief priests
Not
we have
a king
if
not
Caesar
Then
therefore
he delivered
Him
to them
that
He might be crucified
They took
therefore
249099	-
Jesus
And
bearing
[His] own
249105	-
cross
He went out
249109	to
the
called
249113	of the Skull
Place
which
is called
in Hebrew
Golgotha
where
Him
they crucified
and

and
on that side
in between
now

Wrote
then
249140	also
a title
249143	-
Pilate
and
put [it]

Nazareth
249161	the

249165	of the
Jews
249168	This
therefore
249171	the
title
249174	many
read
249177	of the
Jews
for
249181	near
was
249184	the
place

city
where
was crucified
249192	-
Jesus
and
249196	it was
written
in Hebrew
in Latin
in Greek
Were saying
therefore

Jews
Not

249216	The
249218	King
249220	of the
Jews
but
that
He
said
249227	King
I am
249230	of the
Jews
Answered
249234	-
Pilate
What
I have written
I have written
249240	The
then
soldiers
when
they crucified
249246	-
Jesus
took
249250	the
249252	garments
of Him
and
made
249257	four
parts
249260	to each
soldier
a part
and also
249265	the
tunic
Was
now

tunic
seamless
249274	from
249276	the
top
woven
249280	throughout
all
They said
therefore
249285	to
one another
Not
let us tear up
it
but
let us cast lots
249293	for
it
whose
it will be
that
249299	the
Scripture
might be fulfilled
They divided
249304	the
249306	garments
of Me
among them
and
249311	for
249313	the
249315	clothing
of Me
they cast
a lot
249320	The
indeed
therefore
soldiers
these things
did
Had been standing
now
249329	by
249331	the
249333	cross
249335	-
of Jesus
249338	the

of Him
Mary
249354	the [wife]
249356	-
of Clopas
and
Mary
249361	-
Magdalene
Jesus
therefore
having seen
249367	[His]
mother
and
249371	the
disciple
standing by
whom
He loved
says
249378	to
[His] mother
Woman
behold
249383	the
249385	son
of you
Then
He says
249390	to the
disciple
Behold
249394	the
249396	mother
of you
And
249400	from
249402	that
249404	-
hour
took
249408	the
disciple
her
249412	to
249414	the
own
249417	After
this
knowing
249421	-
Jesus
that
now
all things
had been accomplished
so that
might be fulfilled
249430	the
Scripture
He says
I thirst
249435	A vessel
had been set [there]
249438	of sour wine
full
249441	a sponge
therefore
249444	filled
249446	with
sour wine
a stalk of hyssop
having put on
they brought
249452	it
249454	to the
mouth
When
therefore
took
249460	the
sour wine
249463	-
Jesus
He said
It has been finished
And
having bowed
249470	the
head
He yielded up
249474	the
spirit
249477	-
Therefore
the Jews
because
[the] Preparation
it was
so that
not
would remain
249487	on
249489	the
cross
249492	the

249495	on
249497	the

was
for
a high
249503	-
249505	day
249507	that
249509	-
Sabbath
asked
249513	-
Pilate
that
might be broken
249518	their
249520	-
legs
and
they might be taken away
Came
therefore
249527	the
soldiers
and
249533	of the
indeed
first
broke
the
legs
and
249541	of the
other
-
having been crucified with
Him
249547	to

249550	-
Jesus
having come
when
they saw
already
Him
having been dead
not
they did break
249561	His
249563	-
legs
But
249567	one
249569	of the
soldiers
with a spear
249573	His
249575	-
side
pierced
and
came out
immediately
blood
and
water
And
the [one]
having seen
has borne witness
and
true
249591	of him
is
249594	the
testimony
And
He
knows
that
truth
he is speaking
that
249604	also
you
might believe
Took place
for
these things
so that
249612	the
Scripture
might be fulfilled
249616	Bone
not one
will be broken
of Him
And
again
249623	another
Scripture
says
They will look
249628	on
the [One]

249632	After
then
these things
asked

concealed
however
249653	through
249655	the

and
gave permission
249673	-

He came
therefore
and
took away
249680	the

They took
therefore
249712	the

249716	-
of Jesus
and
bound
it
in linen cloths
249723	with
249725	the
spices
as
[the] custom
is
249731	among the
Jews
to prepare for burial
There was

There
therefore
249764	on account of

249768	Preparation
249770	of the
Jews
because

249825	to
249827	the
249829	other

and
she says
to them
They have taken away
249841	the
Lord
249844	out of
249846	the
tomb
and
not
we know

Peter
and
249861	the

faster
249887	-

and
came
first
249893	to

linen cloths
lying
but
by itself
having been folded up
249952	in
249954	a

Then

that
it behooves

having been shut
where
were
250221	the

250228	fear
250230	of the
Jews
came

But

250354	the
250356	hands
of Him
250359	the
250361	mark

Jesus
250523	in the presence
250525	of the
disciples
which
not
250530	are
written
250533	in
250536	the
book
this
these
however
have been written
that
you may believe
that
Jesus
is

Christ
250551	the
250553	Son

Simon
Peter
I am going
to fish
They say
to him
Come
250639	also
we

you
They went forth
and
went up
250648	into
250650	the
boat
and
250654	during
250656	that
250658	-
night
they caught
nothing
Morning
now
already
having come
stood
Jesus
250669	on
250671	the
shore
not
however
knew
250677	the
disciples
that

therefore

Him
No

And
He said
to them
Cast

250707	side
250709	of the
boat
250712	the
net
and
you will find [some]
They cast
therefore
and
not
it
to haul in
were they able
250724	from
250726	the
250728	multitude
250730	of the
fish
Says
therefore
250736	the
disciple
that
whom
loved
250742	-
Jesus
250745	-
to Peter
250748	The
Lord

Simon
therefore
Peter
having heard
that
250757	the
Lord
it is
250761	the
outer garment
put on
he was
for
naked
and
he cast
himself
250771	into
250773	the
sea
250776	-
And
250779	the other
disciples
250782	in the
boat
came
not
for
were they
far
250790	from
250792	the
land
but
250796	about
250798	away
250800	cubits
two hundred
dragging
250804	the
250806	net
250808	with the
fish
When
therefore
they got out
250814	onto
250816	the
land
they see
a fire of coals
lying
and
fish
lying on [it]
and
bread
Says
to them
250829	-
Jesus
Bring
250833	[some] of
250835	the
fish
that
you have caught
now
Went up
Simon
Peter
and
drew
250846	the
net
250849	to
250851	the
land
250854	full
250857	of fish
large
a hundred
fifty
three
although
so many
there are
not
was torn
250868	the
net
Says
to them
250873	-
Jesus
Come
have breakfast
250878	None
dared
250881	of the
disciples
to ask
Him
You
who
are
knowing
that
250891	the
Lord
it is
Comes
Jesus
and
takes
250899	the
bread
and
gives [it]
to them
and
250906	the
fish
likewise
This [is]
now
the third time
was revealed
Jesus
250915	to the
disciples
having been raised
250919	out from
[the] dead
When
therefore
they had dined
says
250926	-
to Simon
Peter
250930	-
Jesus
250933	Simon
[son] of John
love you
Me
250938	more
than these
He says
to Him
Yes
Lord
You
know
that
I dearly love
You
He says
to him
Feed
250953	the
250955	lambs
of Me
He says
to him
again
a second time
250962	Simon
[son] of John
love you
Me
He says
to Him
Yes
Lord
You
know
that
I dearly love
You
He says
to him
Shepherd
250979	the
250981	sheep
of Me
He says
to him
250986	the
third time
250989	Simon
[son] of John
do you dearly love
Me
Was grieved
250995	-
Peter
because
He said
to him
251001	the
third time
Do you dearly love
Me
And
he said
to Him
Lord
all things
You
know
You
know
that
I dearly love
You
Says
to him
Jesus
Feed
251022	the
251024	sheep
of Me
Truly
truly
I say
to you
When
you were
younger
you dressed
yourself
and
walked
where
you desired
when
however
you shall be old
you will stretch forth
251044	the
251046	hands
of you
and
another
will dress
you
and
will bring [you]
where
not
you do desire
This
now
He said
signifying
251062	by what
death
he will glorify
251066	-
God
And
this
having said
He says
to him
Follow
Me
Having turned
251077	-
Peter
sees
251081	the
disciple
whom
loved
251086	-
Jesus
following
who
also
had reclined
251093	at
251095	the
supper
251098	on
251100	the
251102	bosom
of Him
and
said
Lord
who
is it
who
is betraying
You
Him
therefore
having seen
251116	-
Peter
says
251120	-
to Jesus
Lord
this man
and
what about
Says
to him
251129	-
Jesus
If
him
I desire
to remain
until
I come
what [is it]
251139	to
you
You
Me
follow
Went out
therefore
251147	this
251149	-
saying
251152	among
251154	the
brothers
that
251159	the
disciple
that
not
dies
Not
said
however
to him
251169	-
Jesus
that
not
he dies
but
If
him
I desire
to remain
until
I come
what [is it]
251183	to
you
This
is
251188	the
disciple
-
bearing witness
251193	concerning
these things
and
the [one]
having written
these things
and
we know
that
true
251204	of him
251206	the
testimony
is
There are
now
251212	also
251214	other things
many
that
did
251219	-
Jesus
which
if
they should be written
251225	every
one
not even
251229	itself
I suppose
251232	the
world
to have space
251236	for the
251238	to be written
books
251241	The
indeed
251244	first
account
I composed
251248	concerning
251250	all the things
251252	O
Theophilus
which
began
251257	-
Jesus
to do
both
and
to teach
251264	until
251266	the
day
having given orders
251270	to the
apostles
251273	by
251275	[the] Spirit
Holy
whom
He had chosen
He was taken up
to whom
also
He presented
Himself
alive
251286	after
the
suffering
of Him
251291	with
251293	many
proofs
251296	during
251298	days
forty
being seen
by them
and
speaking
251305	the things
251307	concerning
251309	the
251311	kingdom
251313	-
of God
And
being assembled together
He instructed
them
251320	from
Jerusalem
not
to depart
but
to await
251327	the
251329	promise
251331	of the
Father
That which
you heard
of Me
for
John
indeed
baptized
with water
you
however
251344	with
251346	[the] Spirit
will be baptized
Holy
251350	not
251352	after
251354	many
251356	these
days
Those
indeed
therefore
having come together
were asking
Him
saying
Lord
if
251368	at
251371	the
time
this
are you restoring
251376	the
kingdom
251379	-
to Israel
He said
251383	to
them
Not
yours
it is
to know
times
or
seasons
which
251394	the
Father
put in place
251398	by
251400	-
251402	His own
authority
But
you will receive
power
having come
251409	the
251411	Holy
Spirit
251414	upon
you
and
you will be
251419	for Me
witnesses
251422	in
both
Jerusalem
and
251427	in
251429	all
251431	-
Judea
and
Samaria
and
251437	to
251439	[the] uttermost part
251441	of the
earth
And
these things
having said
beholding
they
He was taken up
and
a cloud
hid
Him
251454	from
251456	the
251458	eyes
of them
And
as
251463	looking intently
they were
251466	into
251468	the
heaven
as was going
He
then
behold
251475	men
two
stood by
them
251480	in
251482	apparel
white
who
also
said
Men
Galileans
why
do you stand
looking
251493	into
251495	-
heaven
251498	This
251500	-
Jesus
-
having been taken up
251505	from
you
251508	into
251510	-
heaven
thus
will come
251515	in that
manner
you beheld
Him
going
251521	into
251523	-
heaven
Then
they returned
251528	to
Jerusalem
251531	from
[the] mount
-
called
Olivet
which
is
251539	near
Jerusalem
251542	a Sabbath dayâs
holding
journey
And
when
they had entered
251549	into
251551	the
upper room
they went up
where
251556	they were
staying
251559	-
both
Peter
and
John
and
James
and
Andrew
Philip
and
Thomas
Bartholomew
and
Matthew
251575	James [son]
of Alphaeus
and
Simon
251580	the
Zealot
and
251584	Judas [son]
of James
251587	These
all
251590	were
steadfastly continuing
with one accord
251594	-
in prayer
251597	with [the]
women
and
Mary
251602	the
251604	mother
251606	-
of Jesus
and
251610	with
251612	the
251614	brothers
of Him
And
251618	in
251621	the
days
these
having stood up
Peter
251627	in
251629	[the] midst
251631	of the
brothers
he said
was
then
251638	[the] number
of names
251641	together
251643	the
same
251646	about
a hundred
twenty
Men
brothers
it was necessary for
to have been fulfilled
251654	the
Scripture
which
spoke beforehand
251659	the
251661	Spirit
251663	-
Holy
251666	by
251668	[the] mouth
of David
251671	concerning
Judas
the [one]
having become
guide
to those
having arrested
Jesus
for
251681	numbered
he was
251684	with
us
and
was allotted
251689	-
251691	a share
251694	of the
ministry
this
This [man]
indeed
then
acquired
a field
251703	out of
251705	[the] reward
251707	-
of unrighteousness
and
headlong
having fallen
he burst open
in [the] middle
and
gushed out
251717	all
251719	the
251721	intestines
of him
And
known
it became
251727	to all
those
dwelling
in Jerusalem
so that
was called
251735	the
field
that
251739	in the
251741	own
251743	language
of them
Akeldama
that
is
251749	Field
of Blood
It has been written
for
251754	in [the]
251756	book
of Psalms
Let become
251760	the
251762	homestead
of him
desolate
and
not
let there be
[one person]
dwelling
251771	in
it
and
251775	The
251777	position
of him
let take
another
It behooves
therefore
251784	the
251786	having accompanied
us
men
251790	during
251792	all
[the] time
that
came in
and
went out
251799	among
us
251802	the
Lord
Jesus
having begun
251807	from
251809	the
251811	baptism
of John
251814	until
251816	the
day
in which
He was taken up
251821	from
us
251824	a witness
251826	of the
251828	resurrection
of Him
251831	with
us
to become
251835	one
of these
And
they put forward
two
Joseph
-
called
Barsabbas
who
was called
Justus
and
Matthias
And
having prayed
they said
You
Lord
251855	knower of the hearts
of all
show
which
You have chosen
251861	of
251863	these
251865	-
two
one
to take
251870	the
251872	place
251874	of the
251876	ministry
this
and
apostleship
251881	from
which
turned aside
Judas
to go
251887	to
251889	the
251891	place
251893	-
own
And
they gave
lots
for them
and
fell
251902	the
lot
251905	on
Matthias
and
he was numbered
251910	with
251912	the
251914	eleven
apostles
And
251918	during
the
arriving of
251922	the
251924	day
251926	-
of Pentecost
they were
all
together
251932	in
251934	the
one [place]
And
came
suddenly
251940	out of
251942	-
heaven
a sound
like
[the] rushing
251948	of a wind
violent
and
it filled
251953	all
251955	the
house
where
251959	they were
sitting
And
there appeared
to them
dividing
tongues
as
of fire
and
sat
251971	upon
251974	one
each
of them
And
they were filled with
all
251981	Spirit
Holy
and
began
to speak
251987	in other
tongues
as
251991	the
Spirit
was giving
to utter forth
to them
251997	Were
now
252000	in
Jerusalem
dwelling
Jews
252006	men
devout
252009	from
252011	every
nation
252014	of those
252016	under
252018	-
heaven
Having come about
now
252024	the
sound
of this
came together
252029	the
multitude
and
was confounded
because
was hearing
252036	one
each
252039	the
252041	own
language
speaking
them
They were amazed
then
and
were marveling
saying
Not
behold
252053	all
these
are
who
are speaking
Galileans
And
how
we
hear
each
252065	the
252067	own
252069	language
of us
252072	in
which
we were born
Parthians
and
Medes
and
Elamites
and
those
inhabiting
252084	-
Mesopotamia

and
Cappadocia

and

Asia
Phrygia

and
252102	the
252104	parts
252106	-
of Libya
252109	that
252111	[are] around
Cyrene
and
252115	those
252117	visiting [here]
from Rome
Jews
both
and
converts
Cretans
and
Arabs
we hear
speaking
them
252130	-
252132	[in] our own
tongues
252135	the
252137	great things
252139	-
of God
Were amazed
then
all
and
were perplexed
252147	other
252149	to
other
saying
What
wishes
this
to be
Others
however
mocking
were saying
-
Of new wine
252163	full
they are
Having stood up
however
252168	-
Peter
252171	with
252173	the
eleven
he lifted up
252177	the
252179	voice
of him
and
spoke forth
to them
252185	Men
of Judea
and

inhabiting
Jerusalem

this
to you
known

252200	the
252202	words
of me
Not

you
suppose
these
are drunkards

for
252215	[the] hour
third
252218	of the
day
but

Joel
And

252242	-
God
I will pour out
252246	of
252248	the
252250	Spirit
of Me
252253	upon

252392	of
Nazareth
252395	a man
having been set forth
252398	by
252400	-
God
252403	to
you
by miracles
and

having crucified
You put to death
whom
252450	-
God
raised up
having loosed
252455	the
252457	agony
252459	of
death
inasmuch as
not
it was
possible
[for] to be held
Him
252468	by
it
David
for
says
252474	about
Him
I foresaw
252478	the
Lord
252481	before
me
252484	continually
everything
because
252488	at [the]
252490	right hand
of me
He is
that
not
I should be shaken
252497	Because of
this
was glad
252501	of me
252503	the
heart
and
rejoiced
252508	the

of me
and
now
252515	also
252517	the

of me
252534	into
Hades
nor
will You allow
252539	the
252541	Holy One
of You
to see

You have made known
to me
252548	[the] paths

David

us
252592	unto
252595	the
day
this
A prophet
therefore
being
and
knowing
that
with an oath
swore
to him
252608	-
God
252611	out of [the]
252613	fruit
252615	of the
252617	loins
of him
to set
252621	upon
252623	the
252625	throne
of him
Having foreseen
he spoke
252630	concerning
252632	the
252634	resurrection
252636	of the
Christ
that
neither
was He abandoned

however
himself
Said
Lord

of me
Sit
252723	at
252725	[the] right hand
of Me

of You
252736	a footstool
252738	of the
252740	feet
of You
Assuredly
therefore
let know
252746	all
252748	[the] house
of Israel

you
crucified
Having heard
then
they were pierced

then
252777	to
252779	-
Peter
and
252783	the
252785	other
apostles

them
Repent

of you
252803	in
252805	the
252807	name
of Jesus
Christ
252811	for the
252813	forgiveness
252815	of the
252817	sins
of you

Spirit
To you

of you
and
252844	to all
252846	those
252848	at
a distance
as many as
-
shall call to Himself
[the] Lord
252855	the
252857	God
of us
252861	Other
and
words

he earnestly testified
and
was exhorting
them
saying
Be saved
252872	from
252875	the
252877	generation
252879	-
perverse
this
Those
indeed
therefore
having received
252887	the
252889	word
of him
were baptized
and
were added
252895	on
252898	the
day
that
252902	souls
252904	about
three thousand
252907	They were
now
steadfastly continuing
252911	in the
252913	teaching
252915	of the
apostles
and
252919	-
in fellowship
252922	the
252924	breaking
252926	of the
bread
and
252930	the
prayers
There was coming
then
252935	upon every
soul
awe
252939	many
and both
wonders
and
signs
252945	through
252947	the
apostles
were taking place
252951	All
now

having believed
252956	together
252958	the

all things
in common

were dividing
them
to all
as

had
252982	Every
day
and
steadfastly continuing
with one accord
252988	in

of food

and
253005	sincerity
of heart
praising

God
and
having
favor
253015	with
253017	all
253019	the
people
253022	-
And
the Lord
kept adding
those who
were being saved
253029	every
day
253032	to
253034	their
number
Peter
now
and
John
were going up
253042	into
253044	the
temple
253047	at
253049	the
253051	hour

And
253060	a certain

253069	of mother
of him
being

whom
they placed
253076	every
day
253079	at
253081	the
253083	gate
253085	of the
temple
-
called
Beautiful
-
to ask for
alms
253094	from
those who
were going
253098	into
253100	the
temple
who
having seen
Peter
and
John
being about
to enter
253110	into
253112	the
temple
was asking
alms
to receive
Having looked intently
now
Peter
253121	upon
him
253124	with
253126	-
John
he said
Look
253131	unto
us
-
And
he began to give heed
to them
expecting
something
253140	from
them
to receive
Said
however
Peter
Silver
and
gold
none
there is
to me
what
however
I have
this
to you
I give

253161	the
253163	name
of Jesus
Christ
253167	of
Nazareth
walk
And
having taken
him
253174	by the
253176	right
hand
he raised up
him
immediately
then
were strengthened
253184	the
253186	feet
of him
and
253190	the
ankles
And
leaping up
he stood
and
began walking
and
he entered
253200	with
them
253203	into
253205	the
temple
walking
and
leaping
and
praising
253213	-
God
And
saw
253218	all
253220	the
people
him
walking
and
praising
253227	-
God
They recognized
then
him
that
he
was
the [one]
253237	for
253239	the
alms
sitting
253243	at
253245	the
253247	Beautiful
253249	Gate
253251	of the
temple
and
they were filled
with wonder
and
amazement
253259	at
that
having happened
to him
Is clinging
now
he
253267	to
Peter
and
253271	-
John
ran together
253275	all
253277	the
people
253280	to
them
253283	in
253285	the
porch
-
called
Solomonâs
greatly amazed
Having seen [it]
however
253294	-
Peter
answered
253298	to
253300	the
people
Men
Israelites
why
wonder you
253307	at
this
Or
on us
why
you look intently
as if
253315	by [our] own
power
or
godliness
[we] have made
-
to walk
him
253324	The
253326	God
of Abraham
and
of Isaac
and
Jacob
253333	the
253335	God
253337	of the
253339	fathers
of us
has glorified
253343	the
253345	servant
of Him
Jesus
whom
you
indeed
betrayed
and
disowned
253355	in
253357	[the] presence
of Pilate
having adjudged
that one
to release [Him]
You
however
253365	the
Holy
and
Righteous One
denied
and
requested
a man
a murderer
to be granted
to you
253377	-
and
253380	the Author
253382	-
of life
you killed
whom
253387	-
God
has raised up
253391	out from
[the] dead
whereof
we
witnesses
are
And
253399	on
253401	the
253403	faith
253405	in the
253407	name
of Him
this [man]
whom
you see
and
know
has strengthened
253416	the
253418	name
of Him
and
253422	the
faith
253425	which [is]
253427	through
Him
has given
to him
253433	the
complete soundness
this
253437	before
253439	all
of you
And
now
brothers
I know
that
253447	in
ignorance
you acted
as
253452	also
253454	the
253456	rulers
of you
253459	-
But
God
what
He foretold
253465	by
253467	[the] mouth
253469	of all
253471	the
prophets
[that] should suffer
253475	the
253477	Christ
of Him
He has fulfilled
thus
Repent
therefore
and
turn again
253486	for
the
blotting out
253490	of your
253492	-
sins
so that
-
may come
253498	times
of refreshing
253501	from
253503	[the] presence
253505	of the
Lord
and
[that] He may send
253510	the [One]
253512	having been appointed
to you
Christ
Jesus
whom
it behooves
heaven
indeed
to receive
253522	until
253524	[the] times
253526	of restoration
of all things
of which
spoke
253531	-
God
253534	by
253536	[the] mouth
253538	of
253540	holy
253543	from
[the] age
253546	His
prophets
Moses
indeed
said
-
A prophet
to you
will raise up
[the] Lord
253557	the
God
253560	out from
253562	the
253564	brothers
of you
like
me
Him
You will listen to
253571	in
253573	all things
as many as
-
He might say
253578	to
you
It will be [that]
now
253583	every
soul
who
if
not
might heed
253591	the
prophet
that
will be utterly destroyed
253596	out from
253598	the
people
253601	And
253603	all
now
253606	the
253608	prophets
253610	from
Samuel
and
253614	those
subsequently
as many as
have spoken
also
have announced
253622	the
days
these
You
are
253628	the
253630	sons
253632	of the
prophets
and
253636	of the
covenant
that
253640	-
God
made
253644	with
253646	the
253648	fathers
of you
saying
253652	to
Abraham
And
253656	in
253658	the
253660	seed
of you
will be blessed
253664	all
253666	the
253668	families
253670	of the
earth
To you
first
having raised up
253676	-
God
253679	the
253681	servant
of Him
sent
Him
blessing
you
253688	in
-
turning away
each
253693	from
253695	the
253697	wickednesses
of you
Speaking
now
of them
253703	to
253705	the
people
came
upon them
253710	the
priests
and
253714	the
253716	captain
253718	of the
temple
and
253722	the
Sadducees
being distressed
253726	because of
-
teaching
their
253731	the
people
and
proclaiming
253736	in
253738	-
Jesus
253741	the
resurrection
253744	-
253746	out from
[the] dead
and
they laid
on them
253752	the
hands
and
put [them]
253757	in
custody
253760	until
253762	the
next day
it was
for
evening
already
253769	Many
however
of those
having heard
253774	the
word
believed
and
became
253780	number
253782	of the
men
253785	about
253787	thousand
five
It came to pass
then
253792	on
253794	the
next day
were gathered together
253798	their
253800	-
rulers
and
253804	-
elders
and
253808	-
scribes
253811	in
Jerusalem
and
Annas
253816	the
high priest
and
Caiaphas
and
John
and
Alexander
and
as many as
were
253828	of
253830	descent
high-priestly
And
having placed
them
253836	in
253838	the
midst
they began to inquire
253842	In
253844	what
power
or
253848	in
253850	what
name
did
this
you
Then
Peter
having been filled
253859	with [the] Spirit
Holy
said
253863	to
them
253866	Rulers
253868	of the
people
and
elders
if
we
this day
are being examined
253877	as to
253879	a good work
253881	[to the] man
ailing
253884	by
what [means]
he
has been healed
known
let it be
253891	to all
you
and
253895	to all
253897	the
253899	people
of Israel
that
253903	in
253905	the
253907	name
of Jesus
Christ
253911	of
Nazareth
whom
you
crucified
whom
253918	-
God
raised
253922	out from
[the] dead
253925	in
Him
this [man]
stands
253930	before
you
sound
This
is
253936	the
stone
-
having been rejected
253941	by
you
253944	the
builders
which
has become
253949	into
253951	head
of [the] corner
And
not
there is
253957	in
253959	other
no one
253962	the
salvation
not
for
253967	name
is there
another
253971	under
253973	-
heaven
-
having been given
253978	among
men
253981	by
which
it behooves
to be saved
us
Seeing
now
253989	the
253992	-
of Peter
boldness
and
of John
and
having understood
that
254001	men
unschooled
they are
and
ordinary
they were astonished
They recognized
then
them
that
254012	with
254014	-
Jesus
they had been
254018	-
And
the man
beholding
254023	with
them
standing
-
having been healed
nothing
they had
to contradict
Having commanded
however
them
254035	outside
254037	the
Council
to go
they began to confer
254042	with
one another
saying
What
shall we do
254049	to the
men
these
That
truly
for
254056	a noteworthy
sign
has come to pass
254060	through
them
254063	to all
those
inhabiting
Jerusalem
[is] evident
and
not
we are able
to deny [it]
But
that
not
254076	on
further
it might spread
254080	among
254082	the
people
let us warn
them
no longer
to speak
254089	in
254092	the
name
this
254096	to no
man
And
having called
them
they commanded [them]
at all
not
to speak
nor
to teach
254108	in
254110	the
254112	name
254114	-
of Jesus
254117	-
But
Peter
and
John
answering
said
254125	to
them
Whether
right
it is
254131	before
254133	-
God
to you
to listen
rather
than
254140	-
God
you must judge
not
are able
for
we
what
we have seen
and
heard
not
to speak
-
And
having further threatened [them]
they let go
them
nothing
finding
the
how
they might punish
them
254165	on account of
254167	the
people
because
all
were glorifying
254173	-
God
254176	for
that
having happened
254180	years [old]
for
was
254184	more than
forty
254187	the
man
254190	on
whom
had taken place
254196	the
sign
this
254200	of
healing
Having been let go
now
they came
254206	to
254208	the
own
and
reported
how much
254214	to
them
254217	the
chief priests
and
254221	the
elders
had said
-
And
having heard
with one accord
they lifted up
[their] voice
254231	to
254233	-
God
and
said
Sovereign Lord
You
-
made
254242	the
heaven
and
254246	the
earth
and
254250	the
sea
and
254254	all
254256	that [is]
254258	in
them
-
254262	of the
254264	father
of us
254267	by
254269	[the] Spirit
Holy
254272	through [the] mouth
David
254275	servant
of You
having spoken
254279	-
Why
did rage
[the] Gentiles
and
peoples
did devise
vain things
Took [their] stand
254289	the
254291	kings
254293	of the
earth
and
254297	the
rulers
were gathered
254301	together
254303	-
themselves
254306	against
254308	the
Lord
and
254312	against
254314	the
254316	Christ
of Him
Were gathered together
for
254321	in
truth
254324	in
254327	the
city
this
254331	against
254333	the
254335	holy
254337	servant
of You
Jesus
whom
You anointed
Herod
both
and
Pontius
Pilate
254348	with
[the] Gentiles
and
254352	peoples
of Israel
to do
whatever
254357	the
254359	hand
of You
and
254363	the
purpose
had determined beforehand
to happen
And
254369	-
now
Lord
look
254374	upon
254376	the
254378	threats
of them
and
grant
254383	to the
254385	servants
of You
254388	with
254390	boldness
all
to speak
254394	the
254396	word
of You
254399	in
that
254402	the
hand
stretch out
You
254407	for
healing
and
signs
and
wonders
to take place
254415	through
254417	the
254419	name
254421	of the
254423	holy
254425	servant
of You
Jesus
And
having prayed
they
was shaken
254433	the
place
254436	in
which
254439	they were
assembled
and
they were filled with
all
254445	the
254447	Holy
Spirit
and
were speaking
254452	the
254454	word
254456	-
of God
254459	with
boldness
254463	-
And
254466	the multitude
-
having believed
were [in]
heart
and
soul
one
and
not
one
254478	anything
of that which
possessed
he
claimed
his own
to be
but
were
to them
all things
in common
And
254492	[with] power
great
were giving
254496	-
254498	testimony
254500	the
apostles
254504	of the
Lord
Jesus
254508	of the
resurrection
254511	grace
then
abundant
was
254516	upon
254518	all
them
Not even
for
254523	in need
anyone
there was
254527	among
them
as many as
for
254532	owners
of lands
or
houses
were
selling [them]
were bringing
254540	the
254542	proceeds
of what
is sold
and
were laying [them]
254548	at
254550	the
254552	feet
254554	of the
apostles
distribution was made
then
to each
just as
-
anyone
need
had
Joseph
now
-
having been called
Barnabas
254570	by
254572	the
apostles
which
254576	is
translated
254579	Son
of encouragement
a Levite
254583	a Cypriot
254585	at the
birth
owns
by him
a field
having sold [it]
brought
254593	the
money
and
laid [it]
254598	at
254600	the
254602	feet
254604	of the
apostles
254608	A man
now
certain
Ananias
named
254614	with
Sapphira
254617	the
254619	wife
of him
sold
a property
and
he kept back
254626	from
254628	the
proceeds
being aware of [it]
254632	also
254634	the
wife
and
having brought
254639	a portion
certain
254642	at
254644	the
254646	feet
254648	of the
apostles
he laid [it]
Said
however
254654	-
Peter
Ananias
254658	because of
why
has filled
254662	-
Satan
254665	the
254667	heart
of you
to lie to
[for] you
254672	the
254674	Spirit
254676	-
Holy
and
to keep back
254681	from
254683	the
254685	proceeds
254687	of the
land
Not
remaining
to you
did it remain
And
having been sold
254696	in
254698	the
254700	own
authority
it was
Why
-
did you purpose
254707	in
254709	the
254711	heart
of you
254715	the
deed
this
Not
you have lied
to men
but
254723	-
to God
Hearing
now
254728	-
Ananias
254732	the
words
these
having fallen down
he breathed his last
And
came
254740	fear
great
254743	upon
254745	all
those
hearing
Having arisen
then
254751	the
younger [men]
covered
him
and
having carried [him] out
buried [him]
It came to pass
now
254762	about
254764	hours
three
afterward
also
254769	the
254771	wife
of him
not
knowing
that
having come to pass
came in
Replied
then
254781	to
her
Peter
Tell
me
if
for so much
254789	the
land
you sold
-
And
she said
Yes
for so much
254798	-
But
Peter [said]
254802	to
her
Why [is it]
that
have agreed together
you
to test
254810	the
254812	Spirit
of [the] Lord
Behold
254816	the
254818	feet
of those
having buried
254822	the
254824	husband
of you
254827	[are] at
254829	the
door
and
they will carry out
you
She fell down
then
immediately
254838	at
254840	the
254842	feet
of him
and
breathed her last
Having come in
then
254849	the
young [men]
found
her
dead
and
having carried out
they buried [her]
254858	by
254860	the
254862	husband
of her
And
came
254867	fear
great
254870	upon
254872	all
254874	the
church
and
254878	upon
254880	all
those
hearing
these things
254885	By
now
254888	the
254890	hands
254892	of the
apostles
were happening
254896	signs
and
wonders
many
254901	among
254903	the
people
And
they were
with one accord
all
254910	in
254912	the
254914	Colonnade
of Solomon
254918	of the
now
rest
no one
dared
to join
them
but
were magnifying
them
254929	the
people
more
now
were added
believing
254936	in the
Lord
254939	multitudes
of men
both
and
women
so as
254946	even
254948	into
254950	the
streets
to bring out
254954	the
sick
and
to put [them]
254959	on
cots
and
mats
that
coming
of Peter
at least
254968	the
shadow
might envelop
254972	some
of them
Were coming together
now
254977	also
254979	the
254981	multitude
254983	from the
254986	surrounding
cities
Jerusalem
bringing
[the] sick
and
[those] being tormented
254994	by
254996	spirits
unclean
254999	who
were healed
all
Having risen up
however
255005	the
high priest
and
255009	all
255011	those
255013	with
him
-
being
255018	the sect
255020	of the
Sadducees
were filled
with jealousy
and
they laid
255027	the
hands
255030	on
255032	the
apostles
and
put
them
255038	in
255040	[the] jail
public
255043	An angel
however
of [the] Lord
255047	during
the night
having opened
255051	the
255053	doors
255055	of the
prison
having brought out
then
them
said
Go
and
having stood
speak
255066	in
255068	the
temple
255071	to the
people
255074	all
255076	the
255078	words
255081	of the
life
this
Having heard
now
they entered
255088	at
255090	the
dawn
255093	into
255095	the
temple
and
were teaching
Having come
now
255102	the
high priest
and
255106	those
255108	with
him
they called together
255112	the
Council
even
255116	all
255118	the
255120	Senate
255122	of the
255124	sons
of Israel
and
sent
255129	to
255131	the
prison house
to bring
them
255136	-
And
255139	having come
[the] officers
not
did find
them
255145	in
255147	the
prison
having returned
then
they reported back
saying
-
255155	The
prison house
we found
shut
255160	with
255162	all
security
and
255166	the
guards
standing
255170	before
255172	the
doors
having opened [them]
however
inside
no one
we found
When
now
they heard
255184	the
words
these
255188	-
both
255191	the captain
255193	of the
temple
and
255197	the
chief priests
were perplexed
255201	concerning
them
what
-
might be
this
Having come
then
a certain one
reported
to them
-
Behold
255215	the
men
whom
you put
255220	in
255222	the
prison
255225	are
255227	in
255229	the
temple
standing
and
teaching
255235	the
people
Then
having gone
255240	the
captain
255243	with
255245	the
officers
was bringing
them
not
255251	with
force
they were afraid of
for
255256	the
people
lest
they might be stoned
Having brought
then
them
they set [them]
255265	in
255267	the
Council
And
asked
them
255273	the
high priest
saying
by a charge
we commanded
you
not
to teach
255282	in
255285	the
name
this
And
behold
you have filled
255292	-
Jerusalem
255295	with the
255297	teaching
of you
and
you intend
to bring
255303	upon
us
255306	the
255308	blood
255311	of the
man
this
Answering
however
Peter
and
255319	the
apostles
said
To obey
it is necessary
God
rather
than
men
255329	The
255331	God
255333	of the
255335	fathers
of us
raised up
Jesus
whom
you
killed
having hanged [Him]
255344	on
a tree
Him
255348	-
God
[as] Prince
and
Savior
exalted
255355	by the
255357	right hand
of Him
-
to give
repentance
255363	-
to Israel
and
255367	forgiveness
of sins
And
we
are
255373	witnesses
255376	of the
things
these
and also
255381	the
255383	Spirit
255385	-
Holy
whom
has given
255390	-
God
to those
obeying
Him
-
And
having heard
they were cut [to the heart]
and
were desiring
to put to death
them
Having risen up
however
255406	a certain [man]
255408	in
255410	the
Council
255413	a Pharisee
named
Gamaliel
255417	a teacher of the law
255419	honored
255421	by all
255423	the
people
he commanded [them]
outside
for a short while
255429	the
men
to put
He said
then
255435	to
them
Men
Israelites
take heed
to yourselves
255442	with
255445	the
men
these
what
you are about
to do
255452	Before
for
255455	these
255457	-
days
rose up
Theudas
affirming
to be
somebody
himself
to whom
were joined
255469	of men
number
255472	about
four hundred
who
was put to death
and
255478	all
as many as
were persuaded
by him
were dispersed
and
it came
255486	to
nothing
255489	After
this man
rose up
Judas
255494	the
Galilean
255497	in
255499	the
255501	days
255503	of the
registration
and
drew away
people
255509	after
him
And he
perished
and
255515	all
as many as
were persuaded
by him
were scattered
And
255522	-
now
I say
to you
withdraw
255528	from
255531	the
men
these
and
let alone
them
for
if
be
255541	from
men
255545	the
plan
this
or
255551	the
work
this
it will be overthrown
if
however
255558	from
God
it is
not
you will be able
to overthrow
them
lest
ever
255568	also
fighting against God
You would be found
They were persuaded
now
by him
and
having called in
255577	the
apostles
having beaten
they commanded [them]
not
to speak
255584	in
255586	the
255588	name
255590	-
of Jesus
and
released [them]
They
indeed
therefore
departed
rejoicing
255600	from
255602	[the] presence
255604	of the
Council
that
they had been counted worthy
255609	for
255611	the
Name
to suffer dishonor
255615	Every
then
day
255619	in
255621	the
temple
and
255625	in
house
not
they ceased
teaching
and
proclaiming the good news that
255633	the
Christ
[is] Jesus
255637	In
now
255641	the
days
these
[as] are multiplying
255646	the
disciples
there arose
255650	a grumbling
255652	of the
Hellenists
255655	against
255657	the
Hebrews
because
were being overlooked
255662	in
255664	the
255666	distribution
255668	-
daily
255671	the
255673	widows
of them
Having called near
then
255678	the
Twelve
255681	the
255683	multitude
255685	of the
disciples
they said
Not
desirable
it is [for]
us
having neglected
255694	the
255696	word
255698	-
of God
to attend
tables
Select
therefore
brothers
255709	men
255711	out from
yourselves
being well attested
seven
255716	full
of [the] Spirit
and
wisdom
whom
we will appoint
255723	over
255726	the
task
this
We
now
255732	in the
prayer
and
255736	the
255738	ministry
255740	of the
word
will steadfastly continue
And
was pleasing
255746	the
statement
255749	before
255751	all
255753	the
multitude
and
they chose
Stephen
255759	a man
255761	full
of faith
and
255765	[of the] Spirit
holy
and
Philip
and
Prochorus
and
Nicanor
and
Timon
and
Parmenas
and
Nicolas
a convert
of Antioch
whom
they set
255784	before
255786	the
apostles
and
having prayed
they laid
on them
255793	the
hands
And
255797	the
255799	word
255801	-
of God
continued to increase
and
was multiplied
255807	the
255809	number
255811	of the
disciples
255814	in
Jerusalem
exceedingly
255818	a great
then
255821	multitude
255823	of the
priests
were becoming obedient
255827	to the
faith
Stephen
now
255832	full
grace
and
power
was performing
255838	wonders
and
signs
great
255843	among
255845	the
people
Arose
however
255850	certain
255852	of those
255854	from
255856	the
synagogue
-
called
Freedmen
including
Cyrenians
and
Alexandrians
and
255867	of those
255869	from
Cilicia
and
Asia
disputing
255875	with
Stephen
And
not
they were able
to withstand
255882	the
wisdom
and
255886	the
Spirit
by whom
he was speaking
Then
they suborned
255893	men
saying
-
We have heard
him
speaking
255900	words
blasphemous
255903	against
Moses
and
255907	-
God
They stirred up
then
255912	the
people
and
255916	the
elders
and
255920	the
scribes
and
having come upon [him]
they seized
him
and
brought [him]
255929	to
255931	the
Council
They set
also
255937	witnesses
false
saying
255942	The
man
this
not
does stop
speaking
words
255950	against
255952	the
255954	place
255956	-
holy
and
255960	the
law
we have heard
for
him
saying
that
255968	Jesus
255970	of
Nazareth
this
will destroy
255976	the
place
this
and
will change
255982	the
customs
that
delivered
to us
Moses
And
having looked intently
255991	on
him
255994	all
-
sitting
255998	in
256000	the
Council
saw
256004	the
256006	face
of him
as
256010	[the] face
of an angel
Said
then
256015	the
high priest
If
these things
so
are
-
And
he began to speak
Men
brothers
and
fathers
listen
256030	The
256032	God
256034	-
of glory
appeared
256038	to the
256040	father
of us
Abraham
being
256045	in
256047	-
Mesopotamia
before
rather
dwelling
his
256054	in
Haran
and
He said
256059	to
him
Go out
256063	from
256065	the
256067	country
of you
and
256071	the
256073	kindred
of you
and
come
256078	into
256080	the
land
which
-
to you
I will show
Then
having gone out
256089	from
256091	[the] land
of Chaldeans
he dwelt
256095	in
Haran
And from there
256099	after
-
died
256103	the
256105	father
of him
He removed
him
256110	into
256113	the
land
this
256117	in
which
you
now
dwell
And
not
He did give
to him
an inheritance
256128	in
it
not even
256132	[the] length
of a foot
but
He promised
to give
to him
256139	for
a possession
it
and
256144	to the
256147	descendants
of him
256150	after
him
not
there being
to him
a child
Spoke
however
thus
256160	-
God
that
will be
256165	the
256167	seed
of him
a sojourner
256171	in
256173	a land
strange
and
they will enslave
it
and
will mistreat [it]
256181	years
four hundred
And
256185	the
nation
to which
if
they will be in bondage
will judge
I
256193	-
God
said
and
256198	after
these things
they will come forth
and
will serve
Me
256205	in
256208	the
place
this
And
He gave
to him
256215	[the] covenant
of circumcision
and
thus
he begat
256221	-
Isaac
and
circumcised
him
256227	on the
256229	day
256231	-
eighth
and
Isaac
256236	-
Jacob
and
Jacob
256241	the
256243	twelve
patriarchs
And
256247	the
patriarchs
having envied
256251	-
Joseph
sold [him]
256255	into
Egypt
But
was
256260	-
God
256263	with
him
and
rescued
him
256269	out of
256271	all
256273	the
256275	tribulations
of him
and
gave
him
favor
and
wisdom
256284	before
Pharaoh
256287	king
of Egypt
and
he appointed
him
ruler
256294	over
Egypt
and
256298	all
256300	the
256302	house
of him
Came
then
a famine
256308	upon
256310	all
256312	-
of Egypt
and
Canaan
and
256318	affliction
great
and
not
were finding
sustenance
256325	the
256327	fathers
of us
Having heard
now
Jacob
[there] is
grain
256335	in
Egypt
he sent forth
256339	the
256341	fathers
of us
first
and
256346	on
256348	the
second time
was made known
Joseph
256353	to
256355	brothers
of him
and
known
became
256361	-
to Pharaoh
256364	the
256366	family
of Joseph
Having sent
then
Joseph
he called for
Jacob
256374	the
256376	father
of him
and
256380	all
256382	the
kindred
256385	in all
256387	souls
seventy
five
And
went down
Jacob
256394	into
Egypt
and
died
he
and
256401	the
256403	fathers
of us
and
they were carried over
256408	into
Shechem
and
were placed
256413	in
256415	the
tomb
which
had bought
Abraham
256421	for a sum
of silver
256424	from
256426	the
256428	sons
of Hamor
256431	in
Shechem
As
now
was drawing near
256437	the
256439	time
256441	of the
promise
that
had made
256446	-
God
256449	-
to Abraham
increased
256453	the
people
and
multiplied
256458	in
Egypt
256461	until
that
there arose
256465	king
another
256468	over
Egypt
who
not
knew
256474	-
Joseph
He
having dealt treacherously with
256479	the
256481	race
of us
he mistreated
256485	the
fathers
-
making [them]
256490	the
256492	infants
abandon
of them
256496	unto
the
not
they would live
256501	In
256503	that
time
was born
Moses
and
he was
beautiful
256511	-
to God
who
was brought up
256516	months
three
256519	in
256521	the
256523	house
256525	of the
father
Having been set outside
then
he
took up
him
256533	the
256535	daughter
of Pharaoh
and
brought up
him
for herself
256542	for
a son
And
was instructed
Moses
256548	all
256550	[the] wisdom
of [the] Egyptians
he was
now
mighty
256556	in
256558	words
and
deeds
of him
When
then
was fulfilled
to him
256567	of forty years
a period
it came
256571	into
256573	the
256575	mind
of him
to visit
256579	the
256581	brothers
of him
256584	the
256586	sons
of Israel
And
having seen
a certain one
being wronged
he defended [him]
and
did
vengeance
for the [one]
being oppressed
having struck down
256600	the
Egyptian
He was supposing
now
to understand
256606	the
brothers
that
256610	-
God
256613	by
256615	[the] hand
of him
is giving
salvation
them
-
but
not
they understood
256625	On the
and
256628	following
day
he appeared
to those who
were quarreling
and
urged
them
256637	to
peace
having said
Men
brothers
you are
256644	So that
why
wrong you
one another
The [one]
however
mistreating
256652	the
neighbor
pushed away
him
having said
Who
you
appointed
256661	ruler
and
judge
256665	over
us
Not
to kill
me
you
desire
256673	the same
way
you put to death
yesterday
256678	the
Egyptian
Fled
then
Moses
256684	at
256687	the
remark
this
and
became
exiled
256694	in
256696	[the] land
of Midian
where
he begat
256701	sons
two
And
having been passed
256706	years
forty
appeared
to him
256711	in
256713	the
256715	wilderness
256717	of the
Mount
Sinai
an angel
256722	in
256725	a flame
of fire
of a bush
256729	-
And
Moses
having seen [it]
marveled at
256735	the
vision
coming near
then
of him
to behold [it]
there was
256743	[the] voice
of [the] Lord
I [am]
256747	the
256749	God
256751	of the
256753	Fathers
of you
256756	the
256758	God
of Abraham
and
of Isaac
and
of Jacob
Terrified
then
having become
Moses
not
he dared
to look
Said
then
to him
256775	the
Lord
Take off
256779	the
256781	sandal
256783	of the
256785	feet
of you
256788	-
for
the place
256792	on
which
you stand
256796	ground
holy
is
Having seen
I saw
256802	the
256804	oppression
256806	of the
256808	people
of Me
256811	-
256813	in
Egypt
and
256817	the
256819	groans
of them
I have heard
and
I have come down
to deliver
them
and
now
come
I will send
you
256832	to
Egypt
256835	This
256837	-
Moses
whom
they rejected
having said
Who
you
appointed
ruler
and
judge
him
256850	whom
God [as]
and
ruler
and
redeemer
sent
256858	by
256860	[the] hand
of [the] angel
-
having appeared
to him
256866	in
256868	the
bush
this one
led out
them
having done
wonders
and
signs
256878	in
[the] land
of Egypt
and
256883	in
256885	[the] Red
Sea
and
256889	in
256891	the
wilderness
256894	years
forty
This
is
256899	the
Moses
-
having said
256904	to the
256906	sons
of Israel
A prophet
for you
will raise up
256912	-
God
256915	out from
256917	the
256919	brothers
of you
like
me
This
is
the [one]
having been
256928	in
256930	the
congregation
256933	in
256935	the
wilderness
256938	with
256940	the
angel
-
speaking
to him
256946	in
256948	the
Mount
Sinai
and
256953	of the
256955	fathers
of us
who
received
256960	oracles
living
to give
to us
to whom
not
were willing
obedient
to be
256970	the
256972	fathers
of us
but
thrust away
and
turned back
256979	in
256981	the
256983	hearts
of them
256986	to
Egypt
having said
256990	-
to Aaron
Make
us
gods
who
will go before
us
257000	-
As for
Moses
this
who
brought out
us
257008	from
257010	[the] land
of Egypt
not
we know
what
has happened
to him
And
they made a calf
257020	in
257023	the
days
those
and
offered
a sacrifice
257030	to the
idol
and
they were rejoicing
257035	in
257037	the
257039	works
257041	of the
257043	hands
of them
Turned away
however
257048	-
God
and
delivered
them
to worship
257055	the
257057	host
257059	of
heaven
as
it has been written
257064	in [the]
257066	book
257068	of the
prophets
Not
slain beasts
and
sacrifices
did you offer
to Me
257078	years
forty
257081	in
257083	the
wilderness
257086	O house
of Israel
And
You took up
257091	the
257093	tabernacle
257095	-
of Moloch
and
257099	the
257101	star
257103	of the
god
Rephan
257107	the
images
that
you made
to worship
them
and
I will remove
you
257117	beyond
Babylon
257120	The
257122	tabernacle
257124	of the
testimony
was
257128	with
257130	fathers
of us
257133	in
257135	the
wilderness
just as
had commanded
the [One]
speaking
257142	-
to Moses
to make
it
257147	according to
257149	the
pattern
that
he had seen
which
also
brought [it]
having received by succession
257158	the
257160	fathers
of us
257163	with
Joshua
257166	in
257168	the
257170	taking possession
257172	of the
nations
whom
drove out
257177	-
God
257180	from [the]
257182	face
257184	of the
257186	fathers
of us
257189	until
257191	the
257193	days
of David
who
found
favor
257199	before
257201	-
God
and
asked
to find
a dwelling place
257208	for the
257210	God
of Jacob
Solomon
however
built
Him
[the] house
Yet
not
257220	the
Most High
257223	in
hand-made [houses]
dwells
As
257228	the
prophet
says
257232	-
Heaven [is]
to Me
a throne
257237	-
and
the earth
257241	a footstool
257243	of the
257245	feet
of Me
257248	What kind of
house
will you build
Me
says
[the] Lord
or
what [is]
257257	[the] place
257259	of the
257261	rest
of Me
Not
257265	the
257267	hand
of Me
has made
257271	these things
all
Stiff-necked
and
257276	uncircumcised
in heart
and
257280	-
ears
you
always
257285	the
257287	Spirit
257289	-
Holy
resist
as
257294	the
257296	fathers
of you
257299	also
you
257302	Which
257304	of the
prophets
not
did persecute
257309	the
257311	fathers
of you
And
they killed
those
having foretold
257318	about
257320	the
257322	coming
257324	of the
Righteous One
of whom
now
you
betrayers
and
murderers
have become
who
received
257336	the
law
257339	by
257341	[the] ordination
of angels
and
not
have kept [it]
Hearing
now
these things
they were cut
257351	in the
257353	hearts
of them
and
began gnashing
257358	the
teeth
257361	at
him
He being
however
full
257367	of [the] Spirit
Holy
having looked intently
257371	into
257373	-
heaven
saw
257377	[the] glory
of God
and
Jesus
standing
257383	at
257385	the right hand
257387	-
of God
and
he said
Behold
I see
257394	the
heavens
having been opened
and
257399	the
257401	Son
257403	-
of Man
257406	at
257408	the right [hand]
standing
257411	-
of God
Having cried out
then
257416	in a voice
loud
they held
257420	the
257422	ears
of them
and
rushed
with one accord
257428	upon
him
and
having cast [him]
257433	out of
257435	the
city
they began to stone [him]
And
257440	the
witnesses
laid aside
257444	the
257446	garments
of them
257449	at
257451	the
257453	feet
257455	of a young man
named
Saul
And [as]
they were stoning
257461	-
Stephen
he was calling out
and
saying
Lord
Jesus
receive
257470	the
257472	spirit
of me
Having fallen
then
257477	on [his]
knees
he cried
257481	in a voice
loud
Lord
not
place
to them
257488	this
257490	-
sin
And
this
having said
he fell asleep
Saul
now
257499	was there
consenting
257502	to the
257504	killing
of him
Arose
then
257509	on
257511	that
257513	-
day
257516	a persecution
great
257519	against
257521	the
church
257524	which [was]
257526	in
Jerusalem
All
then
were scattered
257532	throughout
257534	the
257536	regions
257538	-
of Judea
and
Samaria
257543	except
257545	the
apostles
Buried
now
257550	-
Stephen
257553	men
devout
and
made
257558	lamentation
great
257561	over
him
Saul
however
was destroying
257567	the
church
257570	[houses] after
257572	-
houses
entering
dragging off
then
men
and
women
he was delivering [them]
257582	to
prison
Those
indeed
therefore
having been scattered
went about
preaching
257591	the
word
Philip
now
having gone down
257597	to
257599	-
257601	[a] city
257603	-
of Samaria
was proclaiming
to them
257608	the
Christ
Were giving heed
now
257613	the
crowds
to the things
being spoken
257618	by
257620	-
Philip
with one accord
257624	in
the [time]
to hear
them
and
to see
257631	the
signs
that
he was performing
257636	Many
for
of those
having
257641	spirits
unclean
crying
257645	voice
in a loud
they were coming out [of them]
257649	many
now
having been paralyzed
and
lame
were healed
There was
then
257658	great
joy
257661	in
257664	the
city
that
257669	A man
now
certain
named
Simon
had been formerly
257676	in
257678	the
city
practicing sorcery
and
amazing
257684	the
257686	people
257688	-
of Samaria
declaring
to be
257693	someone
himself
great
to whom
were giving heed
257699	all
257701	from
small
257704	to
great
saying
This one
is
257710	the
257712	power
257714	-
of God
that
[is] called
Great
They were giving heed
now
to him
257723	because
the
257726	long
time
257729	with the
magic arts
he had amazed
them
When
however
they believed
257737	-
Philip
proclaiming the gospel
257741	concerning
257743	the
257745	kingdom
257747	-
of God
and
257751	the
257753	name
of Jesus
Christ
they were baptized
men
both
and
women
257762	-
And
Simon
257766	also
himself
believed
and
having been baptized
257772	was
steadfastly continuing
257775	-
with Philip
Beholding
then
[the] signs
and
257782	miracles
great
being performed
he was amazed
Having heard
now
257789	the
257792	in
Jerusalem
apostles
that
had received
257798	-
Samaria
257801	the
257803	word
257805	-
of God
they sent
257809	to
them
Peter
and
John
who
having come down
prayed
257818	for
them
that
they might receive [the]
257823	Spirit
Holy
Not yet
for
257828	He was
257830	upon
257832	any
of them
fallen
only
however
257838	baptized
they had been
257841	into
257843	the
257845	name
257847	of the
Lord
Jesus
Then
they began laying
257853	the
hands
257856	upon
them
and
they received
257861	[the] Spirit
Holy
Having seen
now
257866	-
of Simon
that
257870	through
257872	the
257874	laying on
257876	of the
257878	hands
257880	of the
apostles
was given
257884	the
Spirit
he offered
to them
money
saying
Give
also to me
257894	the
authority
this
that
on whom
if
I may lay
257902	the
hands
he may receive
257906	[the] Spirit
Holy
Peter
however
said
257912	to
him
257915	The
257917	silver
of you
257920	with
you
may it be
257924	to
destruction
because
257928	the
257930	gift
257932	-
of God
you thought
257936	by
money
to be obtained
No
there is
to you
part
nor
lot
257946	in
257949	the
matter
this
257953	the
for
257956	heart
of you
not
is
right
257962	before
257964	-
God
Repent
therefore
257969	of
257972	the
257974	wickedness
of yours
this
and
pray earnestly to
257980	the
Lord
if
indeed
will be forgiven
you
257987	the
257989	intent
257991	of the
257993	heart
of you
257996	in
for
257999	[the] gall
of bitterness
and
258003	[the] bond
of iniquity
I see
you
being
Answering
now
258011	-
Simon
said
Pray earnestly
you
258017	on behalf
of me
258020	to
258022	the
Lord
so that
258026	nothing
may come
258029	upon
me
of which
you have spoken
They
indeed
therefore
having earnestly testified
and
having spoken
258040	the
258042	word
258044	of the
Lord
traveled back
258048	to
Jerusalem
258051	to many
then
258054	villages
258056	of the
Samaritans
they were preaching the gospel
258060	An angel
now
of [the] Lord
spoke
258065	to
Philip
saying
Rise up
and
go
258072	toward
[the] south
258075	to
258077	the
road
-
going down
258082	from
Jerusalem
258085	to
Gaza
This
is
[the] desert [road]
And
having risen up
he went
And
behold
a man
an Ethiopian
a eunuch
258099	a potentate
of Candace
258102	queen
of [the] Ethiopians
who
was
258107	over
258109	all
258111	the
258113	treasure
of her
who
had come
to worship
258119	to
Jerusalem
258122	he was
then
returning
and
sitting
258128	in
258130	the
258132	chariot
of him
and
he was reading
258137	the
prophet
Isaiah
Said
then
258143	the
Spirit
258146	-
to Philip
Go near
and
join yourself
258153	to the
chariot
this
Having run up
then
258159	-
Philip
heard
him
reading
Isaiah
258166	the
prophet
and
said
Then
also
understand you
what
you are reading
-
And
he said
How
for
-
could I be able
if
not
someone
will guide
me
He invited
then
258190	-
Philip
having come up
to sit
258195	with
him
258198	-
Now
258201	the passage
258203	of the
Scripture
which
he was reading
was
this
As
a sheep
258212	to
slaughter
He was led
and
as
a lamb
258219	before
the [one]
shearing
him
[is] silent
so
not
He opens
258228	the
258230	mouth
of Him
258233	In
258235	the
humiliation
258238	-
258240	justice
from Him
was taken away
258244	The
258246	generation
of Him
who
will describe
For
is removed
258253	from
258255	the
earth
258258	the
258260	life
of Him
Answering
now
258265	the
eunuch
258268	-
to Philip
said
I pray
you
258274	concerning
whom
258277	the
prophet
says
this
258282	Concerning
himself
or
258286	concerning
258288	other
some
Having opened
then
258293	-
Philip
258296	the
258298	mouth
of him
and
having begun
258303	from
258306	the
Scripture
this
he proclaimed the good news
to him
258312	-
Jesus
As
then
they were going
258318	along
258320	the
road
they came
258324	upon
258326	some
water
and
says
258331	the
eunuch
Behold
water
what
prevents
me
to be baptized
And
he commanded
to stop
258343	the
chariot
And
they went down
both
258349	to
258351	the
water
258354	-
both
Philip
and
258359	the
eunuch
and
he baptized
him
When
now
they came up
258368	out of
258370	the
water
258373	[the] Spirit
of [the] Lord
carried away
258377	-
Philip
and
not
saw
him
no longer
258385	the
eunuch
he went
for
258390	the
258392	way
of him
rejoicing
Philip
however
was found
258399	at
Azotus
and
passing through
he was proclaiming the gospel
258406	to the
towns
all
258410	until
-
coming
his
258415	to
Caesarea
258418	-
But
Saul
still
breathing out
threats
and
murder
258427	toward
258429	the
258431	disciples
258433	of the
Lord
having gone
258437	to the
high priest
requested
258441	from
him
258445	letters
258447	in
Damascus
258450	to
258452	the
synagogues
so that
if
258457	any
he found
258460	of the
way
being
men
both
and
women
having bound
he might bring [them]
258470	to
Jerusalem
258473	In
now
-
proceeding
it came to pass
[as] he
draws near
258481	-
to Damascus
suddenly
also
him
flashed around
a light
258489	from
258491	-
heaven
And
having fallen
258496	on
258498	the
ground
he heard
a voice
saying
to him
Saul
Saul
why
Me
do you persecute
He said
then
Who
are You
Lord
-
And [He said]
I
am
Jesus
whom
you
are persecuting
But
rise up
and
enter
258527	into
258529	the
city
and
it will be told
you
that
what
you
it behooves
to do
258540	-
And
the men
-
traveling with
him
stood
speechless
hearing
indeed
258551	the
voice
no one
however
seeing
Rose up
then
Saul
258560	from
258562	the
ground
having been opened
however
258567	the
258569	eyes
of him
nothing
he could see
Leading by the hand
then
him
they brought [him]
258578	to
Damascus
And
258582	he was
258584	days
three
without
seeing
and
neither
did he eat
nor
drink
There was
now
258597	a certain
disciple
258600	in
Damascus
named
Ananias
And
said
258607	to
him
258610	in
a vision
258613	the
Lord
Ananias
-
And
he said
Behold
me
Lord
258623	-
And
the Lord
258627	to
him [said]
Having risen up
go
258632	into
258634	the
street
-
called
Straight
and
seek
258642	in
258644	[the] house
of Judas
258647	Saul
named
of Tarsus
Behold
for
he is praying
and
he saw
258656	a man
Ananias
named
having come
and
having put
on him
hands
so that
he might see again
Answered
but
Ananias
Lord
I have heard
258672	from
many
258675	concerning
258678	the
man
this
258682	how many
evils
258685	to
258687	saints
of You
he did
258691	in
Jerusalem
and
here
he has
258697	authority
258699	from
258701	the
chief priests
to bind
258705	all
those
calling on
258709	the
258711	name
of You
Said
however
258716	to
him
258719	the
Lord
Go
for
258724	a vessel
of choice
is
to Me
this [man]
-
to carry
258732	the
258734	name
of Me
258737	before
Gentiles
and
also
kings
258743	[the] sons
then
of Israel
I
for
will show
to him
how much
it behooves
him
258754	for
258756	the
258758	name
of Me
to suffer
Went away
then
Ananias
and
entered
258767	into
258769	the
house
and
having laid
258774	upon
him
258777	the
hands
he said
Saul
Brother
258783	the
Lord
has sent
me
Jesus
the [One]
having appeared
to you
258792	on
258794	the
road
by which
you were coming
that
you may see again
and
be filled
258803	[of the] Spirit
Holy
And
immediately
fell
258810	of him
from
258813	the
eyes
[something] like
scales
he regained his sight
also
And
having risen up
he was baptized
and
having taken
food
he was strengthened
He was
now
258829	with
258831	the
258834	in
Damascus
disciples
258838	days
some
And
immediately
258843	in
258845	the
synagogues
he began proclaiming
258849	-
Jesus
that
He
is
258855	the
258857	Son
258859	-
of God
Were amazed
then
258864	all
-
hearing
and
were saying
Not
this
is
the [one]
having ravaged
258875	in
Jerusalem
those
calling on
258881	the
name
this
And
here
258887	for
this
he had come
that
having been bound
them
he might bring
258895	to
258897	the
chief priests
Saul
however
all the more
was empowered
and
kept confounding
Jews
-
dwelling
258909	in
Damascus
proving
that
this
is
258916	the
Christ
When
now
had passed
258922	days
many
plotted together
258926	the
Jews
to kill
him
became known
however
258933	-
to Saul
258936	the
258938	plot
of them
They were closely watching
now
258943	also
258945	the
gates
day
and
also
night
so that
him
they might kill
having taken [him]
however
258957	the
258959	disciples
of him
by night
258963	through
258965	the
wall
they let down
him
having lowered [him]
258971	in
a basket
Having arrived
then
258976	in
Jerusalem
he was attempting
to join
258981	the
disciples
And
all
were afraid of
him
not
believing
that
he is
a disciple
Barnabas
however
having taken
him
brought [him]
258998	to
259000	the
apostles
and
he related
to them
how
259007	on
259009	the
road
he had seen
259013	the
Lord
and
that
He had spoken
to him
and
how
259022	in
Damascus
he had spoken boldly
259026	in
259028	the
259030	name
of Jesus
And
259034	he was
259036	with
them
coming in
and
going out
259042	in
Jerusalem
speaking boldly
259046	in
259048	the
259050	name
259052	of
Lord
He was speaking
also
and
was debating
259059	with
259061	the
Hellenists
-
but
they were seeking
to kill
him
Having known [it]
however
259071	the
brothers
brought down
him
259076	to
Caesarea
and
sent away
him
259082	to
Tarsus
259085	The
indeed
then
church
259090	throughout
259092	all
259094	-
of Judea
and
Galilee
and
Samaria
had
peace
being edified
and
going on
259106	in the
259108	fear
259110	of the
Lord
and
259114	in the
259116	comfort
259118	of the
259120	Holy
Spirit
they were multiplied
It came to pass that
now
Peter
passing
259128	through
all [quarters]
went down
259132	also
259134	to
259136	the
saints
-
inhabiting
Lydda
He found
then
there
259147	a man
certain
named
Aeneas
259152	for
259154	years
eight
lying
259158	on
a bed
who
was
paralyzed
And
said
to him
259167	-
Peter
Aeneas
heals
you
Jesus
Christ
rise up
and
make the bed
for yourself
And
immediately
he rose up
And
saw
him
259185	all
those
inhabiting
Lydda
and
259191	-
Sharon
who
turned
259196	to
259198	the
Lord
259201	In
Joppa
now
259205	certain
there was
259208	a disciple
named
Tabitha
which
translated
is called
Dorcas
She
was
full of
259219	works
good
and
of alms
that
she continually did
It came to pass
however
259228	in
259231	the
days
those
[that] having become sick
she
died
Having washed [her]
then
put [her]
259241	in
an upper room
259244	Near
now
being
Lydda
259249	-
Joppa
259252	the
disciples
having heard
that
Peter
is
259259	in
it
sent
259263	two
men
259266	to
him
imploring
Not
to delay
coming
259273	to
us
Having risen up
then
Peter
went with
them
who
having arrived
brought [him]
259284	into
259286	the
upper room
And
stood by
him
259292	all
259294	the
widows
weeping
and
showing
[the] tunics
and
garments
that
had made
259305	with
them
being
259309	-
Dorcas
Having put
then
outside
all
259316	-
Peter
and
having bowed
259321	the
knees
he prayed
And
having turned
259327	to
259329	the
body
he said
Tabitha
arise
-
And
she opened
259338	the
259340	eyes
of her
and
having seen
259345	-
Peter
she sat up
Having given
then
her
[his] hand
he raised up
her
Having called
then
259357	the
saints
and
259361	the
widows
he presented
her
living
Known
then
it became
259370	throughout
259372	all
259374	-
of Joppa
and
believed
many
259380	on
259382	the
Lord
It came to pass
then
259387	days
many
he stayed
259391	in
Joppa
259394	with
259396	a certain
Simon
a tanner
259404	A man
now
certain
259408	in
Caesarea
named
Cornelius
259413	[was] a centurion
259415	of
[the] Cohort
that
is called
Italian
devout
and
fearing
259424	-
God
259427	with
259429	all
259431	the
259433	household
of him
doing
259437	alms
many
259440	to the
people
and
praying
259445	to
God
259448	continually
all
He saw
259452	in
a vision
clearly
259456	as if
259458	about
259461	hour
the ninth
259464	of the
day
259467	an angel
259469	-
of God
having come
259473	to
him
and
having said
to him
Cornelius
-
And
having looked intently
on him
and
afraid
having become
he said
What
is it
Lord
He said
then
to him
259494	The
259496	prayers
of You
and
259500	the
259502	alms
of you
have ascended
259506	as
a memorial
259509	before
259511	-
God
And
now
send
men
259518	to
Joppa
and
summon
259523	Simon
a man
who
is called
Peter
He
lodges
259531	with
259533	a certain
Simon
a tanner
whose
is
[the] house
259540	by
[the] sea
When
then
had departed
259546	the
angel
-
speaking
to him
having called
259553	two
259555	of the
servants
and
259560	a soldier
devout
of those who
are attending
him
and
having related
all things
to them
he sent
them
259572	to
259574	-
Joppa
259577	On the
now
next day
as are journeying
these
and
259584	the
city
approaching
went up
Peter
259590	on
259592	the
housetop
to pray
259596	about
259598	hour
the sixth
He became
then
hungry
and
desired
to eat
[as] were preparing
however
they
fell
259611	upon
him
a trance
and
he beholds
259617	-
heaven
opening
and
descending
259623	a vessel
certain
as
259627	a sheet
great
259630	by four
corners
being let down
259634	upon
259636	the
earth
259639	in
which
were
259643	all
259645	the
259647	quadrupeds
and
creeping things
259651	of the
earth
and
259655	birds
259657	of
heaven
And
came
a voice
259663	to
him
Having risen up
Peter
kill
and
eat
259671	-
And
Peter
said
In no way
Lord
for
never
have I eaten
259681	anything
common
or
unclean
And
a voice
[came] again
259689	for
the second time
259692	to
him
What
259696	-
God
has cleansed
you
not
call common
This
now
took place
259706	for
three times
and
immediately
was taken up
259712	the
vessel
259715	into
259717	-
heaven
While
then
259722	in
himself
was perplexed
259726	-
Peter
what
-
might be
259732	the
vision
that
he had seen
behold
259738	the
men
-
having been sent
259743	from
259745	-
Cornelius
having inquired for
259749	the
259751	house
259753	-
of Simon
stood
259757	at
259759	the
gate
And
having called out
they were asking
if
Simon
who [is]
called
Peter
here
is lodged
259772	-
And
of Peter
thinking
259777	over
259779	the
vision
said
259783	the
Spirit
Behold
259787	men
three
are seeking
you
But
having risen
go down
and
proceed
259797	with
them
nothing
doubting
because
I
have sent
them
Having gone down
then
Peter
259809	to
259811	the
men
he said
Behold
I
am
whom
you seek
what [is]
259821	the
cause
259824	for
which
you are here
-
And
they said
Cornelius
a centurion
259833	a man
righteous
and
fearing
259838	-
God
being well testified to
then
259843	by
259845	all
259847	the
259849	nation
259851	of the
Jews
was divinely instructed
259855	by
259857	an angel
holy
to send for
you
259862	to
259864	the
259866	house
of him
and
to hear
a message
259872	from
you
Having called in
therefore
them
he lodged [them]
259879	On the
now
next day
having risen up
he went forth
259885	with
them
and
259889	some
259891	of the
brothers
259894	those
259896	from
Joppa
went with
him
259901	On the
now
next day
he entered
259906	into
259908	-
Caesarea
259911	-
and
Cornelius
259915	was
expecting
them
having called together
259920	the
259922	relatives
of him
and
259926	-
259928	close
friends
As
then
was
-
entering
259936	-
Peter
having met
him
259941	-
Cornelius
having fallen
259945	at
259947	the
feet
worshiped [him]
259951	-
But
Peter
lifted up
him
saying
Rise up
259959	also
259961	I
myself
a man
am
And
talking with
him
he entered
and
he finds
having gathered together
many
He was saying
then
259976	to
them
You
know
how
unlawful
it is
259984	for a man
a Jew
to unite himself
or
to come near
to a foreigner
To me
259992	however
God
has shown
259996	not
common
or
unclean
to call
man
Therefore
also
without objection
I came
having been summoned
I inquire
therefore
260010	for what
reason
did you summon
me
And
260016	-
Cornelius
was saying
260020	Ago
260022	four
days
260025	until
260027	this
260029	the
hour
260032	I was
260034	at the
ninth hour
praying
260038	in
260040	the
260042	house
of me
and
behold
a man
stood
260049	before
me
260052	in
260054	apparel
bright
and
said
Cornelius
has been heard
260061	your
260063	-
prayer
and
260067	the
260069	alms
of you
have been remembered
260073	before
260075	-
God
Send
therefore
260080	to
Joppa
and
call for
Simon
who
is called
Peter
He
lodges
260091	in
260093	[the] house
of Simon
a tanner
260097	by
[the] sea
At once
therefore
I sent
260103	to
you
you
then
well
did
having come
Now
therefore
260113	all
we
260116	before
260118	-
God
are present
to hear
260123	all
the things
having been commanded
you
260128	by
260130	the
Lord
Having opened
then
Peter
260136	the
mouth
he said
260140	Of
a truth
I understand
that
not
is
One who shows partiality
260148	-
God
but
260152	in
260154	every
nation
the [one]
fearing
Him
and
working
righteousness
acceptable
to Him
is
260166	the
word
that
He sent
260171	to the
260173	sons
of Israel
proclaiming the gospel
peace
260178	by
Jesus
Christ
He
is
260184	of all
Lord
You yourselves
know
260189	the
having come
declaration
260193	through
260195	all
260197	-
Judea
having begun
260201	from
260203	-
Galilee
260206	after
260208	the
baptism
that
proclaimed
John
Jesus
260215	-
260217	from
Nazareth
how
anointed
Him
260223	-
God
260226	Spirit
with Holy
and
with power
who
went about
doing good
and
healing
260236	all
those
being oppressed
260240	by
260242	the
devil
because
260246	-
God
was
260250	with
Him
And
we
260255	[are] witnesses
of all things
that
He did
260260	in
both
260263	the
260265	region
260267	of the
Jews
and
Jerusalem
whom
also
they put to death
having hanged [Him]
260276	on
a tree
This One
260280	-
God
raised up
260284	on
260286	the
260288	third
day
and
gave
Him
manifest
to become
not
260297	to all
260299	the
people
but
to [the] witnesses
-
having been chosen beforehand
260306	by
260308	-
God
to us
who
did eat with
and
drink with
Him
260317	after
-
rising
His
260322	out from
[the] dead
And
He instructed
us
to proclaim
260329	to the
people
and
to testify fully
that
He
is
260337	the [One]
260339	having been appointed
260341	by
260343	-
God
260346	[as] judge
of living
and
dead
To Him
260352	all
260354	the
prophets
bear witness
260358	[that] forgiveness
of sins
receives
260362	through
260364	the
260366	name
of Him
260369	everyone
-
believing
260373	in
Him
Still
speaking
260378	-
of Peter
260382	the
words
these
fell
260387	the
260389	Spirit
260391	-
Holy
260394	upon
260396	all
those
hearing
260400	the
word
And
were amazed
260405	the
260408	from
[the] circumcision
believers
as many as
had come with
260414	-
Peter
that
260418	even
260420	upon
260422	the
Gentiles
260425	the
260427	gift
260429	of the
260431	Holy
Spirit
has been poured out
They were hearing
for
them
speaking
in tongues
and
magnifying
260442	-
God
Then
answered
Peter
If not
260449	the
water
is able
to withhold
anyone
-
not
to baptize
these
who
260460	the
260462	Spirit
260464	-
Holy
have received
just as
260469	also [have]
we
He commanded
now
them
260475	in
260477	the
260479	name
of Jesus
Christ
to be baptized
Then
they asked
him
to remain
260488	days
some
Heard
now
260493	the
apostles
and
260497	the
brothers
-
being
260502	in
260504	-
Judea
that
260508	also
260510	the
Gentiles
had received
260514	the
260516	word
260518	-
of God
When
also
went up
Peter
260525	to
Jerusalem
began contending
260529	with
him
260532	those
260534	of
[the] circumcision
saying
-
You went
260540	to
260542	men
uncircumcision
having
and
ate with
them
Having begun
now
Peter
he set [it] forth
to them
in order
saying
I
260557	was
260559	in
[the] city
of Joppa
praying
and
I saw
260566	in
a trance
a vision
descending
260571	a vessel
certain
like
260575	a sheet
great
260578	by four
corners
being let down
260582	out of
260584	-
heaven
and
it came down
260589	as far as
me
260592	On
it
having looked intently
I was observing [it]
and
I saw
260599	the
260601	quadrupeds
260603	of the
earth
and
260607	the
wild beasts
and
260611	the
creeping things
and
260615	the
260617	birds
260619	of the
air
I heard
then
also
a voice
saying
to me
Having risen up
Peter
kill
and
eat
I said
however
In no way
Lord
for
common
or
unclean
nothing ever
has entered
260643	into
260645	the
260647	mouth
of me
Answered
however
260652	for
a second [time]
the voice
260656	out of
260658	-
heaven
What
260662	-
God
has cleansed
you
not
do call unholy
This
now
happened
260672	on
three times
and
was drawn up
again
all
260679	into
260681	-
heaven
And
behold
immediately
260687	three
men
stood
260691	at
260693	the
house
260696	in
which
I was
having been sent
260701	from
Caesarea
260704	to
me
Told
now
260709	the
Spirit
me
to go with
them
not
having discriminated
Went
now
260719	with
me
260722	also
260725	-
260727	six
brothers
these
and
we entered
260733	into
260735	the
260737	house
260739	of the
man
He related
then
to us
how
he had seen
260747	the
angel
260750	in
260752	the
260754	house
of him
having stood
and
having said
Send forth
260761	to
Joppa
and
send for
Simon
who
is called
Peter
who
will speak
words
260773	to
you
260776	in
which
will be saved
you
and
260782	all
260784	the
260786	household
of you
260789	In
then
-
beginning
my
to speak
fell
260797	the
260799	Spirit
260801	-
Holy
260804	upon
them
even as
260808	also
260810	upon
us
260813	in [the]
beginning
I remembered
then
260818	the
260820	word
260822	of the
Lord
how
He had said
John
indeed
baptized
with water
you
however
will be baptized
260834	with [the]
260836	Spirit
Holy
If
then
260841	the
260843	same
gift
has given
to them
260848	-
God
as
260852	also
to us
having believed
260856	on
260858	the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
I
how
was
able
to forbid
260868	-
God
Having heard
then
these things
they were silent
and
glorified
260877	-
God
saying
Then indeed
260882	also
260884	to the
Gentiles
260887	-
God
260890	-
260892	repentance
260894	unto
life
has given
Those
indeed
therefore
having been scattered
260902	by
260904	the
tribulation
-
having taken place
260909	over
Stephen
passed through
260913	to
Phoenicia
and
Cyprus
and
Antioch
to no one
speaking
260922	the
word
if
not
only
to Jews
Were
however
260931	some
260933	of
them
men
of Cyprus
and
of Cyrene
who
having come
260942	into
Antioch
were speaking
260946	also
260948	to
260950	the
Hellenists
proclaiming the gospel
260954	the
Lord
Jesus
And
was
260960	[the] hand
of [the] Lord
260963	with
them
260966	[a] great
then
number
-
having believed
turned
260973	to
260975	the
Lord
Was heard
now
260980	the
260982	report
260984	in
260986	the
260988	ears
260990	of the
church
-
being
260995	in
Jerusalem
260998	concerning
them
and
they sent forth
Barnabas
261004	as far as
Antioch
who
having come
and
having seen
261011	the
grace
261014	of
261016	-
God
rejoiced
and
was exhorting
all
261023	with
261025	resolute purpose
261027	-
of heart
to abide
261031	the
Lord
For
he was
261036	a man
good
and
261040	full
261042	of [the] Spirit
Holy
and
of faith
And
was added
261049	a crowd
large
261052	to the
Lord
He went forth
then
261057	to
Tarsus
to seek
Saul
and
having found [him]
he brought [him]
261065	to
Antioch
It came to pass [that]
now
they
261071	also
261073	a year
whole
gathered together
261077	in
261079	the
church
and
taught
261084	a crowd
large
Were called
then
first
261090	in
Antioch
261093	the
disciples
Christians
261097	In
261099	these
now
261102	-
days
came down
261106	from
Jerusalem
prophets
261110	to
Antioch
Having risen up
now
261116	one
261118	of
them
named
Agabus
he signified
261124	by
261126	the
Spirit [that]
261129	a famine
great
is about
to be
261134	over
261136	all
261138	the
world
which
came to pass
261143	under
Claudius
261146	-
And
the disciples
as
was prospered
anyone
determined
261154	each
of them
261157	for
ministry
to send
261161	to the
261163	dwelling
261165	in
261167	-
Judea
brothers
which
also
they did
having sent [it]
261175	to
261177	the
elders
261180	by [the]
261182	hand
of Barnabas
and
Saul
261187	At
261189	that
now
261192	-
time
put forth
Herod
261197	the
king
261200	the
hands
to mistreat
261204	some
261206	of those
261208	of
261210	the
church
He put to death
then
James
261216	the
261218	brother
of John
with the sword
Having seen
now
that
pleasing
it is
261227	to the
Jews
he proceeded
to take
261232	also
Peter
these were
now
261237	days
261239	of the
Unleavened [Bread]
whom
also
having seized
he put
261246	in
prison
having delivered [him]
261250	to four
261252	sets of four
soldiers
to guard
him
intending
261258	after
261260	the
Passover
to bring out
him
261265	to the
people
261268	-
Indeed
therefore
Peter
was kept
261274	in
261276	the
prison
prayer
however
261281	was
fervent
being made
261285	by
261287	the
church
261290	to
261292	-
God
261295	concerning
him
When
then
was about
to bring forth
him
261303	-
Herod
261307	the
night
that
261311	was
261313	-
Peter
sleeping
261317	between
261319	two
soldiers
having been bound
261323	with chains
two
guards
also
261328	before
261330	the
door
were watching
261334	the
prison
And
behold
261339	an angel
of [the] Lord
stood by
and
a light
shone
261346	in
261348	the
cell
Having struck
then
261353	the
261355	side
261357	-
of Peter
he woke up
him
saying
Rise up
261364	in
haste
And
fell
261369	of him
261371	the
chains
261374	off
261376	the
hands
Said
then
261381	the
angel
261384	to
him
Gird yourself about
and
put on
261390	the
261392	sandals
of you
He did
and
so
And
he says
to him
Wrap around [you]
261402	the
261404	cloak
of you
and
follow
me
And
having gone forth
he was following
and
not
did know
that
real
is
what
is happening
261421	by means of
261423	the
angel
he was thinking
however
a vision
he saw
Having passed through
then
261432	a first
guard
and
a second
they came
261438	to
261440	the
261442	gate
261444	-
iron
-
leading
261449	into
261451	the
city
which
by itself
opened
to them
And
having gone out
they went on through
261461	street
one
and
immediately
departed
261467	the
angel
261470	from
him
And
261474	-
Peter
261477	to
himself
having come
said
Now
I know
truly
that
has sent forth
261487	the
Lord
261490	the
261492	angel
of Him
and
delivered
me
261498	out of
261500	[the] hand
of Herod
and
261504	all
261506	the
261508	expectation
261510	of the
261512	people
261514	of the
Jews
Having considered [it]
also
he came
261520	to
261522	the
261524	house
261526	of
Mary
261529	the
261531	mother
of John
who
is called
Mark
where
261538	were
many
having gathered together
and
praying
Having knocked
then
of him
261547	[at] the
261549	door
261551	of the
gate
came
261555	a girl
to answer
named
Rhoda
And
having recognized
261562	the
261564	voice
261566	-
of Peter
261569	from
261571	-
joy
not
she opened
261576	the
gate
having run in
but
she reported
to be standing
261583	-
Peter
261586	before
261588	the
gate
-
And
261593	to
her
they said
You are out of your mind
-
But
she kept insisting
[it] so
to be
-
And
they kept saying
261606	The
angel
it is
of him
261611	-
But
Peter
continued
knocking
having opened [it]
then
they saw
him
and
were amazed
Having made a sign
then
to them
261626	with the
hand
to be silent
he related
to them
how
261633	the
Lord
him
had brought
261638	out of
261640	the
prison
He said
then
Report
to James
and
261648	to the
brothers
these things
And
having gone out
he went
261655	to
261657	another
place
Having come
now
day
there was
261664	disturbance
261666	no
small
261669	among
261671	the
soldiers
what
then [of]
261676	-
Peter
has become
Herod
then
having sought after
him
and
not
having found [him]
having examined
261688	the
guards
he commanded [them]
to be led away [to death]
And
having gone down
261695	from
261697	-
Judea
261700	to
Caesarea
he stayed [there]
261704	He had been
now
furiously angry
with [the] Tyrians
and
Sidonians
with one accord
then
they came
261714	to
him
And
having gained
Blastus
261720	who [was]
261722	over
261724	the
261726	bedchamber
261728	of the
king
they were seeking
peace
261733	because of
-
being nourished
261737	their
261739	-
region
261742	by
261744	the
kingâs
261747	On the appointed
now
day
261751	-
Herod
having put on
261755	apparel
royal
having sat
261759	on
261761	the
throne
was making an address
261765	to
them
261768	-
And
the people
were crying out
261773	Of a god
[this is the] voice
and
not
of a man
Immediately
then
struck
him
261783	an angel
of [the] Lord
261786	in return
for that
not
he gave
261791	the
glory
261794	-
to God
and
having been
eaten by worms
he breathed his last
261801	-
But
261804	the word
261806	-
of God
continued to grow
and
to multiply
Barnabas
then
and
Saul
returned
261817	to
Jerusalem
having fulfilled
261821	the
mission
having taken with [them]
John
the [one]
having been called
Mark
There were
now
261831	in
Antioch
261834	in
261836	the
261838	being [there]
church
prophets
and
teachers
261844	-
both
Barnabas
and
Simeon
who
was called
Niger
and
Lucius
261855	the
Cyrenian
Manaen
also
261860	Herod
261862	the
tetrarch
brought up with
and
Saul
As were ministering
now
they
261871	to the
Lord
and
fasting
said
261877	the
261879	Spirit
261881	-
Holy
Set apart
then
to Me
261887	-
Barnabas
and
Saul
261892	for
261894	the
work
to which
I have called
them
Then
having fasted
and
having prayed
and
having laid
261906	the
hands
on them
they sent [them] off
They
indeed
therefore
having been sent forth
261915	by
261917	the
261919	Holy
Spirit
went down
261923	to
Seleucia
From there
then
they sailed
261929	to
Cyprus
And
having come
261934	into
Salamis
they began proclaiming
261938	the
261940	word
261942	-
of God
261945	in
261947	the
261949	synagogues
261951	of the
Jews
They had
now
261956	also
John [as]
a helper
Having passed through
now
261962	all
261964	the
island
261967	as far as
Paphos
they found
261971	a man
a certain
magician
261975	a false prophet
Jewish
whose
name
[was] Bar-Jesus
who
was
261983	with
261985	the
proconsul
Sergius
Paulus
261990	man
an intelligent
He
having called to [him]
Barnabas
and
Saul
desired
to hear
262000	the
262002	word
262004	-
of God
Was opposing
however
them
Elymas
262011	the
magician
thus
for
means
262017	the
262019	name
of him
seeking
to turn away
262024	the
proconsul
262027	from
262029	the
faith
Saul
then
262034	-
262036	also [called]
Paul
having been filled
262040	[the] Spirit
Holy
having looked intently
262044	upon
him
said
O
262049	full
262051	of all
deceit
and
262055	all
craft
262058	son
of [the] devil
262061	enemy
262063	of all
righteousness
not
will you cease
perverting
262069	the
262071	ways
262073	the
of Lord
262076	-
straight
And
now
behold
262082	[the] hand
of the Lord
262085	[is] upon
you
and
you will be
blind
not
seeing
262093	the
sun
262096	during
a season
Immediately
then
fell
262102	upon
him
mist
and
darkness
and
going about
he was seeking
someone to lead [him] by the hand
Then
having seen
262114	the
proconsul
that
having happened
he believed
being astonished
262121	at
262123	the
262125	teaching
262127	of the
Lord
Having sailed
then
262132	from
262134	-
Paphos
262137	[with] those
262139	around [him]
Paul
came
262143	to
262145	Perga
262147	-
of Pamphylia
John
however
having departed
262153	from
them
returned
262157	to
Jerusalem
They
now
having passed through
262163	from
262165	-
Perga
came
262169	to
262171	Antioch
262173	-
of Pisidia
and
having gone
262178	into
262180	the
synagogue
262183	on the
262185	day
262187	of the
Sabbaths
they sat down
262191	After
then
262194	the
262196	reading
262198	of the
law
and
262202	of the
Prophets
sent
262206	the
rulers of the synagogue
262209	to
them
saying
Men
brothers
if
262216	any
there is
262219	among
you
262223	a word
of exhortation
262226	toward
262228	the
people
speak
Having risen up
then
Paul
and
having made a sign
262237	with the
hand
he said
Men
Israelites
and
those
fearing
262246	-
God
listen
262250	The
262252	God
262255	of the
people
this
of Israel
chose
262261	the
262263	fathers
of us
and
262267	the
people
exalted
262271	in
262273	the
262275	sojourn
262277	in
262279	[the] land
of Egypt
and
262283	with
262285	arm
uplifted
brought
them
262290	out of
it
and
262294	of about
262296	forty years
for a period
He endured the ways
their
262301	in
262303	the
wilderness
and
having destroyed
262309	nations
seven
262312	in
262314	[the] land
of Canaan
He gave as an inheritance
262318	the
262320	land
of them
262323	during
262325	years
four hundred
and
fifty
And
262331	after
these things
He gave [them]
judges
262336	until
262338	Samuel
prophet
Then
they asked for
a king
and
gave
to them
262347	-
God
262350	-
Saul
262353	son
of Kish
262356	a man
262358	of [the]
262360	tribe
of Benjamin
262363	years
forty
And
having removed
him
He raised up
262370	-
David
to them
262374	as
king
to whom
also
He said
having carried witness
I have found
David
262383	the
262385	[son]
of Jesse
262388	a man
262390	according to
262392	the
262394	heart
of Me
who
will do
262399	all
262401	the
262403	will
of Me
262407	Of this [man]
262409	-
God
of
262413	the
seed
262416	according to
promise
has brought
262420	-
to Israel
[the] Savior
Jesus
having proclaimed
John
262427	before [the]
262429	face
262431	of the
262433	coming
of Him
262436	a baptism
of repentance
262439	to all
262441	the
262443	people
of Israel
While
then
was fulfilling
John
262450	the
course
he was saying
Whom
me
do you suppose
to be
Not
am
I [he]
but
behold
He comes
262464	after
me
of whom
not
I am
worthy
262471	a
262473	sandal
262475	of the
feet
to untie
Men
brothers
262481	sons
262483	of [the] family
of Abraham
and
262488	those
262490	among
you
fearing
262494	-
God
to us
262498	the
262500	message
262503	of the
salvation
this
has been sent
Those
for
dwelling
262511	in
Jerusalem
and
262515	the
262517	rulers
of them
Him
not having known
and
262523	the
262525	voices
262527	of the
prophets
that
262531	on
262533	every
Sabbath
are being read
having condemned [Him]
they fulfilled [them]
And
262540	no
262542	cause
of death
having found
they begged
Pilate
to put to death
him
When
then
they had finished
262553	all
the things
262556	about
Him
having been written
having taken [Him] down
262561	from
262563	the
tree
they put [Him]
262567	in
a tomb
262570	-
But
God
raised
Him
262576	out from
[the] dead
who
appeared
262581	for
262583	days
many
to those
having come up with
Him
262589	from
262591	-
Galilee
262594	to
Jerusalem
who
now
are
262600	witnesses
of Him
262603	to
262605	the
people
And
we
to you
preach the gospel
262612	the
262615	to
262617	the
fathers
promise
having been made
that
this
262624	-
God
has fulfilled
262628	to the
262630	children
to us
having raised up
Jesus
as
262636	also
262638	in
262640	the
262642	psalm
it has been written
262645	the
second
262648	Son
of Me
are
You
I
today
have begotten
you
That
then
He raised
Him
262661	out from
[the] dead
no more
being about
to return
262667	to
decay
thus
He spoke
-
I will give
to you
262675	the
262677	holy [blessings]
of David
262680	the
sure [blessings]
Therefore
262684	also
262686	in
another
He says
Not
You will allow
262692	the
262694	Holy One
of you
to see
decay
David
indeed
for
262702	in his own
generation
having served
262706	the
262709	-
of God
purpose
fell asleep
and
was added
262716	to
262718	the
262720	fathers
of him
and
saw
decay
The [One]
however
262728	-
God
raised up
not
did see
decay
Known
therefore
be it
to you
men
brothers
that
262742	through
this One
to you
262746	forgiveness
of sins
is proclaimed
And
262751	from
all things
from which
not
you were able
262757	in
262759	[the] law
of Moses
to be justified
262763	

262766	



Take heed
therefore
lest
might come about
that
having been said
262777	in
262779	the
prophets
Behold
262783	-
scoffers
and
wonder
and
perish
for
a work
am working
I
262794	in
262796	the
262798	days
of you
a work
that
262803	never
not
you would believe
even if
one
should declare it
to you
Having departed
then
they
were begging
262815	on
262817	the
262819	next
Sabbath
to be spoken
to them
262825	the
words
these
Having broken up
then
262831	the
synagogue
followed
262835	many
262837	of the
Jews
and
262841	of the
262843	worshipping
converts
262846	-
Paul
and
262850	-
Barnabas
who
speaking
to them
kept persuading
them
to continue
262859	in the
262861	grace
262863	-
of God
262866	On the
now
262869	coming
Sabbath
262872	almost
262874	all
262876	the
city
was gathered together
to hear
262881	the
262883	word
262885	-
of the Lord
Having seen
however
262890	the
Jews
262893	the
crowds
they were filled
with jealousy
and
began contradicting
the things
262901	by
Paul
spoken
blaspheming
Having spoken boldly
also
262908	-
Paul
and
262912	-
Barnabas
said
To you
it was
necessary
first
to be spoken
262921	the
262923	word
262925	-
of God
but since
you thrust away
it
and
not
262933	worthy
you judge
yourselves
262937	-
262939	of eternal
life
behold
we are turning
262944	to
262946	the
Gentiles
Thus
for
has commanded
us
262953	the
Lord
I have set
you
262958	for
262960	a light
of [the] Gentiles
-
to be
you
262966	for
salvation
262969	to
262971	[the] uttermost part
262973	of the
earth
Hearing [it]
then
262978	the
Gentiles
were rejoicing
and
glorifying
262984	the
262986	word
262988	of the
Lord
and
believed
as many as
262994	were
appointed
262997	to
262999	life
eternal
Was carried
then
263004	the
263006	word
263008	of the
Lord
263011	through
263013	all
263015	the
region
263018	The
but
Jews
incited
263023	the
263025	worshipping
263027	women
263029	-
of honorable position
and
263033	the
263035	principals
263037	of the
city
and
they stirred up
a persecution
263043	against
263045	-
Paul
and
Barnabas
and
expelled
them
263053	from
263055	the
263057	district
of them
-
But
having shaken off
263063	the
263065	dust
263067	of the
feet
263070	against
them
they went
263074	to
Iconium
263077	-
and
the disciples
were filled
with joy
and [the]
263084	Spirit
Holy
It came to pass
now
263089	in
Iconium
263092	according to
263094	the
same
entered
they
263099	into
263101	the
263103	synagogue
263105	of the
Jews
and
spoke
so
that
believed
263113	of Jewish
both
and
Greeks
263118	a great
number
263121	The
however
263124	unbelieving
Jews
stirred up
and
poisoned
263130	the
263132	minds
263134	of the
Gentiles
263137	against
263139	the
brothers
263142	A long
indeed
therefore
time
they stayed
speaking boldly
263149	for
263151	the
Lord
the [One]
bearing witness
263156	to
263158	the
263160	word
263162	of the
263164	grace
of Him
granting
signs
and
wonders
to be done
263172	through
263174	the
263176	hands
of them
Was divided
now
263181	the
263183	multitude
263185	of the
city
and
some
indeed
were
263192	with
263194	the
Jews
some
however
263199	with
263201	the
apostles
When
then
there was
263207	a rush
263209	of the
263211	Gentiles
both
and
Jews
263216	with
263218	the
263220	rulers
of them
to mistreat
and
to stone
them
having become aware
they fled
263229	to
263231	the
263233	cities
263235	-
of Lycaonia
Lystra
and
Derbe
and
263242	the
surrounding region
and there
263246	preaching the gospel
they continued
And
263250	a certain
man
crippled
263254	in
Lystra
263257	in the
feet
was sitting
lame
263262	from
263264	[the] womb
263266	of [the] mother
of him
who
never
had walked
This [man]
heard
263274	-
Paul
speaking
who
having looked intently
at him
and
having seen
that
he has
faith
-
to be healed
said
263289	in a loud
voice
Stand
263293	on
263295	the
263297	feet
of you
upright
And
he sprang up
and
began to walk
263305	-
And
the crowds
having seen
what
had done
Paul
lifted up
263314	the
263316	voice
of them
in Lycaonian
saying
263321	The
gods
having become like
men
have come down
263327	to
us
They began calling
then
263332	-
Barnabas
Zeus
263336	-
and
Paul
Hermes
because
he
was
263344	the
leading
263347	-
speaker
263350	-
And
263353	the priest
263355	-
of Zeus
-
being
263360	just outside
263362	the
city
oxen
and
wreaths
263368	to
263370	the
gates
having brought
263374	with
263376	the
crowds
was desiring
to sacrifice
Having heard
however
263383	the
apostles
Barnabas
and
Paul
having torn
263390	the
263392	garments
of them
rushed out
263396	into
263398	the
crowd
crying out
and
saying
Men
why
these things
do you
263408	Also
we
263412	of like nature
are
with you
men
proclaiming the gospel
to you
263419	from
263421	these
263423	-
vanities
to turn
263427	to
263429	God
[the] living
who
made
263434	the
heaven
and
263438	the
earth
and
263442	the
sea
and
263446	all
263448	the things
263450	in
them
who
263454	in
263456	the
263458	past
generations
allowed
263462	all
263464	the
nations
to go
263468	the
263470	ways
of them
And yet
not
without witness
Himself
He has left
doing good
from heaven
to you
rains
giving
and
263484	seasons
fruitful
filling
with food
and
gladness
263491	the
263493	hearts
of you
And
these things
saying
hardly
they stopped
263501	the
crowds
-
not
sacrificing
to them
Came
however
263510	from
Antioch
and
Iconium
Jews
and
having persuaded
263518	the
crowds
and
having stoned
263523	-
Paul
they dragged [him]
263527	outside
263529	the
city
supposing
him
to have died
Having surrounded
however
263537	the
disciples
him
having risen up
he entered
263543	into
263545	the
city
And
263549	on the
next day
he went away
263553	with
263555	-
Barnabas
263558	to
Derbe
Having proclaimed the gospel to
then
263564	the
city
that
and
having discipled
many
they returned
263572	to
263574	-
Lystra
and
263578	to
Iconium
and
263582	to
Antioch
strengthening
263586	the
263588	souls
263590	of the
disciples
exhorting [them]
to continue
263595	in the
faith
and
that
263600	through
263602	many
tribulations
it behooves
us
to enter
263608	into
263610	the
263612	kingdom
263614	-
of God
Having chosen
now
for them
263620	in every
church
elders
having prayed
263625	with
fasting
they committed
them
263630	to the
Lord
263633	in
whom
they had believed
And
having passed through
263639	-
Pisidia
they came
263643	to
263645	-
Pamphylia
and
having spoken
263650	in
Perga
263653	the
word
they went down
263657	to
Attalia
And from there
they sailed
263662	to
Antioch
from where
263666	they had
been committed
263669	to the
263671	grace
263673	-
of God
263676	for
263678	the
work
that
they had fulfilled
Having arrived
now
and
having gathered together
263687	the
church
they began declaring
all that
had done
263693	-
God
263696	with
them
and
that
He had opened
263702	to the
Gentiles
263705	a door
of faith
They remained
then
263710	time
263712	no
little
263715	with
263717	the
disciples
And
certain ones
having come down
263723	from
263725	-
Judea
were teaching
263729	the
brothers
-
If
not
you are circumcised
263736	according to the
custom
263739	-
of Moses
not
you are able
to be saved
Having been brought about
then
263747	commotion
and
discussion
263751	no
small
263754	-
by Paul
and
263758	-
Barnabas
263761	with
them
they appointed
to go up
Paul
and
Barnabas
and
263770	certain
263772	others
263774	out from
them
263777	to
263779	the
apostles
and
elders
263784	to
Jerusalem
263787	about
263790	the
question
this
They
indeed
therefore
having been sent forward
263798	by
263800	the
church
were passing through
263804	-
both
Phoenicia
and
Samaria
relating in detail
263811	the
263813	conversion
263815	of the
Gentiles
and
they were bringing
263820	joy
great
263823	to all
263825	the
brothers
Having come
then
263830	to
Jerusalem
they were welcomed
263834	by
263836	the
church
and
263840	the
apostles
and
263844	the
elders
They declared
then
all that
263850	-
God
had done
263854	with
them
Rose up
now
263859	certain
263861	of those
263863	of
263865	the
263867	sect
263869	of the
Pharisees
who believed
saying
-
It is necessary
to circumcise
them
to command [them]
then
to keep
263881	the
263883	law
of Moses
Were gathered together
then
263888	the
apostles
and
263892	the
elders
to see
263896	about
263899	the
matter
this
263903	Of much
now
discussion
having taken place
having risen up
Peter
said
263911	to
them
Men
brothers
you
know
that
263919	from
263921	days
early
263924	among
you
chose
263928	-
God
263931	by
263933	the
263935	mouth
of me
to hear
263939	the
Gentiles
263942	the
263944	word
263946	of the
gospel
and
to believe
And
263952	the
heart-knowing
God
bore witness
to them
having given [them]
263959	the
263961	Spirit
263963	-
Holy
as
263967	also
to us
and
not one
He made distinction
263973	between
us
also
and
them
263979	by the
faith
having purified
263983	the
263985	hearts
of them
Now
therefore
why
are you testing
263992	-
God
to put
a yoke
263997	upon
263999	the
264001	neck
264003	of the
disciples
that
neither
264008	the
264010	fathers
of us
nor
we
have been able
to bear
But
264018	by
264020	the
264022	grace
264024	of
[the] Lord
Jesus
we believe
to be saved
264030	in
264032	[the] same
manner [as]
they also
Kept silent
now
264038	all
264040	the
multitude
and
were listening to
Barnabas
and
Paul
relating
what
had done
264051	-
God
signs
and
wonders
264057	among
264059	the
Gentiles
264062	by
them
264065	After
now
-
were silent
they
answered
James
saying
Men
brothers
hear
me
Simeon
has related
how
first
264082	-
God
visited
to take
264087	out of
[the] Gentiles
a people
264091	for the
264093	name
of Him
And
with this
agree
264099	the
264101	words
264103	of the
prophets
as
it is written
264108	After
these things
I will return
and
will rebuild
264114	the
264116	tabernacle
of David
which
has fallen
and
264122	the
ruins
of it
I will rebuild
and
I will set upright
it
so that
-
may seek out
264133	the
264135	remnant
264137	-
of men
264140	the
Lord
264143	and
264145	all
264147	the
Gentiles
264150	upon
whom
has been called
264154	the
264156	name
of Me
264159	upon
them
says
264163	[the] Lord
doing
264166	these things
known
264169	from
eternity
Therefore
I
judge
not
to trouble
264178	those who
264180	from
264182	the
Gentiles
are turning
264186	to
264188	-
God
but
to write
to them
-
to abstain from
264196	the
264198	pollutions
264200	of the
idols
and
264204	-
sexual immorality
and
which is strangled
and
264210	from
blood
Moses
for
264215	from
264217	generations
of old
264220	in every
city
[ones]
proclaiming
him
has
264227	in
264229	the
synagogues
264232	on
264234	every
Sabbath
being read
Then
it seemed good
264240	to the
apostles
and
264244	to the
elders
264247	with
264249	all
264251	the
church
having chosen
men
264256	out from
them
to send
264260	to
Antioch
264263	with
264265	-
Paul
and
Barnabas
Judas
-
called
Barsabbas
and
Silas
264276	men
leading
264279	among
264281	the
brothers
having written
264285	by
264287	[the] hand
of them
264290	The
apostles
and
264294	the
elders
brothers
264298	To those
264301	in
264303	-
Antioch
and
Syria
and
Cilicia
brothers
264311	-
264313	among
the Gentiles
Greetings
Inasmuch as
we have heard
that
264320	some
264322	from
us
troubled
you
by words
upsetting
264329	the
264331	minds
of you
to whom
not
we had given instructions
it seemed good
to us
having come
with one accord
having chosen
men
to send
264344	to
you
264347	with
264349	the
264351	beloved
of us
Barnabas
and
Paul
264357	men
having handed over
264360	the
264362	lives
of them
264365	for
264367	the
264369	name
264371	of the
264373	Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
We have sent
therefore
Judas
and
Silas
264383	and
264385	they
264387	by
word [of mouth]
are telling [you]
264391	the
same things
It seemed good
for
264396	to the
264398	Spirit
264400	-
Holy
and
to us
264406	no
further
to lay
upon you
burden
264412	except
264414	these
264416	-
necessary things
to abstain
from things sacrificed to idols
and
from blood
and
from what is strangled
and
from sexual immorality
264427	From
these
keeping
yourselves
well
you will do
Farewell
They
indeed
therefore
having been sent off
went
264440	to
Antioch
and
having gathered
264445	the
multitude
they delivered
264449	the
letter
Having read [it]
now
they rejoiced
264455	at
264457	the
encouragement
Judas
both
and
Silas
264464	also
themselves
prophets
being
264469	by
264471	talk
much
exhorted
264475	the
brothers
and
strengthened [them]
Having continued
then
a time
they were sent away
264484	in
peace
264487	from
264489	the
brothers
264492	to
those
having sent
them
Paul
however
and
Barnabas
stayed
264502	in
Antioch
teaching
and
proclaiming the good news
264508	with
264510	also
264512	others
many
264515	the
264517	word
264519	of the
Lord
264522	After
now
264525	some
days
said
264529	to
Barnabas
Paul
Having turned back
indeed
let us look after
264536	the
brothers
264539	in
264541	city
every
264544	in
which
we have announced
264548	the
264550	word
264552	of the
Lord
how
they are
Barnabas
now
purposed
to take along
264561	also
264563	-
John
-
called
Mark
Paul
however
thought fit
the [one]
having withdrawn
264574	from
them
264577	from
Pamphylia
and
not
having gone with
them
264584	to
264586	the
work
not
to take along
him
Arose
therefore
a sharp disagreement
so that
separated
they
264598	from
one another
264601	-
and
Barnabas
having taken
264606	-
Mark
sailed
264610	to
Cyprus
Paul
however
having chosen
Silas
went forth
having been committed
264619	to the
264621	grace
264623	of the
Lord
264626	by
264628	the
brothers
He was passing through
then
264633	-
Syria
and
Cilicia
strengthening
264639	the
churches
He came
then
also
264645	to
Derbe
and
264649	to
Lystra
And
behold
264655	a disciple
certain
was
there
named
Timothy
264662	[the] son
264665	of a woman
Jewish
believing
father
however
a Greek
who
was well spoken of
264674	by
264676	the
264679	in
Lystra
and
Iconium
brothers
This one
wanted
264687	-
Paul
264690	with
him
to go forth
and
having taken
he circumcised
him
264698	on account of
264700	the
Jews
-
being
264705	in
264708	the
parts
those
they knew
for
all
that
a Greek
264717	the
264719	father
of him
was
While
then
they were passing through
264726	the
cities
they were delivering
to them
to keep
264732	the
decrees
-
decided on
264737	by
264739	the
apostles
and
elders
264744	who [were]
264746	in
Jerusalem
264749	The
indeed
therefore
churches
were strengthened
264755	in the
faith
and
were increasing
264760	-
in number
264763	every
day
Having passed through
then
264768	-
Phrygia
and
264772	the Galatian
region
having been forbidden
264776	by
264778	the
264780	Holy
Spirit
to speak
264784	the
word
264787	in
264789	-
Asia
having come
then
264794	down to
264796	-
Mysia
they were attempting
264800	into
264802	-
Bithynia
to go
and
not
did allow
them
264810	the
264812	Spirit
of Jesus
having passed by
then
264817	-
Mysia
they came down
264821	to
Troas
And
a vision
264826	during
night
264829	-
to Paul
appeared
A man
264834	of Macedonia
certain
264837	was
standing
and
beseeching
him
and
saying
Having passed over
264846	into
Macedonia
help
us
When
now
264853	the
vision
he had seen
immediately
we sought
to go forth
264860	to
Macedonia
concluding
that
had called
us
264867	-
God
to preach the gospel
to them
Having sailed
then
264874	from
Troas
we made a straight course
264878	to
Samothrace
-
and
the following day
264884	to
264886	Nea
Polis
and from there
264890	to
Philippi
which
is
264895	[the] leading
264898	of the
264900	district
of Macedonia
city
a colony
264905	We were
now
264908	in
264910	this
264912	-
city
staying
264916	days
some
264919	On the
then
264922	day
264924	of the
Sabbaths
we went forth
264928	outside
264930	the
city gate
264933	by
a river
where
was customary
[a place of] prayer
to be
And
having sat down
we began speaking
264943	to the
264945	having gathered
women
And
264950	a certain
woman
named
Lydia
264955	a seller of purple
264957	of [the] city
of Thyatira
worshiping
264961	-
God
was listening
264965	of whom
264967	the
Lord
opened
264971	the
heart
to attend
to the things
being spoken
264977	by
Paul
When
then
she was baptized
and
264984	the
264986	house
of her
she begged
saying
If
you have judged
me
faithful
264995	to the
Lord
to be
having entered
265000	into
265002	the
265004	house
of me
abide
And
she persuaded
us
It happened
now
going
of us
265015	to
265017	the
[place of] prayer
265021	a girl
certain
having
a spirit
of Python
met
us
who
265030	gain
much
was bringing
265034	the
265036	masters
of her
by fortune-telling
She
having followed
265042	-
Paul
and
us
was crying out
saying
265049	These
265051	-
men
265054	servants
265056	of the
God
265059	-
Most High
are
who
proclaim
to you
265066	[the] way
of salvation
This
then
she continued
265072	for
265074	many
days
Having been distressed
then
Paul
and
having turned
265082	to the
spirit
he said
I command
you
265088	in
265090	[the] name
of Jesus
Christ
to come out
265095	from
her
And
it came out
265100	[the] same
265102	-
hour
Having seen
now
265107	the
265109	masters
of her
that
was gone
265114	the
265116	hope
265118	of the
265120	profit
of them
having taken hold of
265124	-
Paul
and
265128	-
Silas
they dragged [them]
265132	into
265134	the
marketplace
265137	before
265139	the
rulers
and
having brought up
them
265145	to the
magistrates
they said
265149	These
265151	-
men
exceedingly trouble
265155	of us
265157	the
city
Jews
being
and
preach
customs
that
not
it is lawful
for us
to accept
nor
to practice
Romans
being
And
rose up together
265176	the
crowd
265179	against
them
and
265183	the
magistrates
having torn off
265187	of them
265189	the
garments
were commanding that
they be beaten with rods
265194	Many
then
having laid
on them
blows
they cast [them]
265201	into
prison
having charged
265205	the
jailer
securely
to keep
them
who
265212	an order
such
having received
threw
them
265218	into
265220	the
265222	inner
prison
and
265226	the
265228	feet
fastened
of them
265232	in
265234	the
stocks
265237	Toward
now
265240	-
midnight
Paul
and
Silas
praying
were singing praises to
265248	-
God
Were listening
now
to them
265254	the
prisoners
Suddenly
then
265259	earthquake
there was
a great
so that
were shaken
265265	the
265267	foundations
265269	of the
prison house
were opened
then
immediately
265276	the
doors
all
and
265281	of all
265283	the
chains
were loosed
Awoken
then
having been
265290	the
jailer
and
having seen
open
265296	the
265298	doors
265300	of the
prison
having drawn
265304	his
sword
he was about
himself
to kill
supposing
to have escaped
265312	the
prisoners
Called out
however
Paul
265318	loud
in a voice
saying
265322	Not
do
to yourself
harm
all
for
we are
here
Having called for
now
lights
he rushed in
and
terrified
having become
he fell down before
265339	-
Paul
and
Silas
And
having brought
them
out
he was saying
Sirs
what
of me
is necessary
to do
that
I may be saved
-
And
they said
Believe
265360	on
265362	the
Lord
Jesus
and
you will be saved
you
and
265370	the
265372	household
of you
And
they spoke
to him
265378	the
265380	word
265382	of the
Lord
265385	along with
265387	all
265389	those
265391	in
265393	the
265395	house
of him
And
having taken
them
265401	in
265403	that
265405	-
265407	hour
265409	of the
night
he washed [them]
265413	from
265415	the
wounds
and
he was baptized
he
and
265423	the [household]
of him
all
immediately
Having brought
then
them
265431	into
265433	the
house
he laid
a table [for them]
and
rejoiced
with all [his] household
having believed
265442	-
in God
Day
then
having come
sent
265449	the
magistrates
265452	the
officers
saying
Release
265458	the
men
those
Reported
then
265464	the
jailer
265468	the
words
these
265472	to
265474	-
Paul
-
Have sent
265479	the
captains
that
you may be let go
Now
therefore
having gone out
depart
265488	in
peace
265491	-
But
Paul
was saying
265496	to
them
Having beaten
us
publicly
uncondemned
265503	men
Romans
being
they cast [us]
265508	into
prison
and
now
secretly
us
do they throw out
No
indeed
Instead
having come
themselves
us
let them bring out
Reported
then
265525	to the
captains
265528	the
officers
265532	the
words
these
They were afraid
then
having heard
that
Romans
they are
And
having come
they appealed to
them
and
having brought [them] out
they were asking [them]
to go out
265550	of
265552	the
city
Having gone forth
then
265557	out of
265559	the
prison
they came
265563	to
265565	-
Lydia
and
having seen [them]
they exhorted
265571	the
brothers
and
departed
Having passed through
then
265578	-
Amphipolis
and
265582	-
Apollonia
they came
265586	to
Thessalonica
where
was
265591	a synagogue
265593	of the
Jews
265596	According to
now
the
custom
265601	-
with Paul
he went in
265605	to
them
and
265609	for
265611	Sabbaths
three
he reasoned
with them
265616	from
265618	the
Scriptures
opening
and
setting forth
that
265625	the
Christ
it behooved
to have suffered
and
to have risen
265632	out from
[the] dead
and
that
this
is
265639	the
Christ
265642	-
Jesus
whom
I
preach
to you
And
265650	some
265652	of
them
were obedient
and
joined themselves
265658	-
to Paul
and
265662	-
to Silas
265666	-
along with
265669	worshipping
Greeks
265672	a multitude
great
265676	women
then
265679	of the
leading
265682	not
a few
Having become jealous
now
265687	the
Jews
and
having taken to [them]
265693	of the
market-loungers
265697	men
certain
wicked
and
having collected a crowd
they set in uproar
265704	the
city
and
having assailed
265709	the
265711	house
of Jason
they were seeking
them
to bring out
265717	to
265719	the
people
Not
having found
however
them
they dragged
Jason
and
265729	certain
brothers
265732	before
265734	the
city authorities
crying out
-
The [ones]
265740	the
world
having upset
these
also
here
are come
whom
has received
Jason
And
265752	these
all
265755	contrary to
265757	the
265759	decrees
of Caesar
do
265763	king
another
proclaiming
to be
Jesus
They stirred up
then
265771	the
crowd
and
265775	the
city authorities
hearing
these things
And
having taken
265782	-
security
265785	from
265787	-
Jason
and
265791	the
rest
they let go
them
265796	-
And
the brothers
immediately
265801	by
night
sent away
265805	-
both
Paul
and
265810	-
Silas
265813	to
Berea
who
having arrived
265818	into
265820	the
265822	synagogue
265824	of the
Jews
went
These
now
were
more noble
265832	than those
265834	in
Thessalonica
who
received
265839	the
word
265842	with
265844	all
readiness
265847	on the
265849	every
day
examining
265853	the
Scriptures
if
were
these things
so
265860	Many
indeed
therefore
265864	of
them
believed
and
265870	of the
265873	Grecian
women
265876	-
prominent
and
men
265881	not
a few
When
however
knew
265887	those
265890	from
265892	-
Thessalonica
Jews
that
265897	also
265899	in
265901	-
Berea
was proclaimed
265905	by
265907	-
Paul
265910	the
265912	word
265914	-
of God
they came
there also
stirring up
and
agitating
265922	the
crowds
Immediately
also
then
265928	-
Paul
sent away
265932	the
brothers
to go
265936	as
265938	to
265940	the
sea
remained
but
265945	-
both
Silas
and
265950	-
Timothy
there
Those
now
escorting
265957	-
Paul
brought [him]
265961	unto
Athens
and
having received
265966	a command
265968	unto
265970	-
Silas
and
265974	-
Timothy
that
265978	as
quickly as possible
they should come
265982	to
him
they departed
265986	In
now
265989	-
Athens
waiting for
them
265994	-
of Paul
was provoked
265998	the
266000	spirit
of him
266003	in
him
seeing
utterly idolatrous
to be
266009	the
city
He was reasoning
indeed
therefore
266015	in
266017	the
synagogue
266020	with the
Jews
and
those
worshiping
and
266027	in
266029	the
marketplace
266032	on
266034	every
day
266037	with
those
meeting [him]
266041	Some
then
also
266045	of the
Epicureans
and
266049	Stoics
philosophers
encountered
him
And
some
were saying
What
-
may desire
266061	of the
babbler
this
to say
Others
however
266069	Of foreign
gods
he seems
a proclaimer
to be
because
266076	-
Jesus
and
266080	the
resurrection
he was proclaiming the gospel of
Having taken hold
also
of him
266087	to
266089	the
Ares
Hill
they brought [him]
saying
Are we able
to know
what [is]
266099	the
new
this
266103	which
266106	by
you
is spoken
teaching
266111	Strange things
for
some
you are bringing
266116	to
266118	the
266120	ears
of us
We resolve
therefore
to know
what
wish
these things
to be
266130	[The] Athenians
now
all
and
266135	the
266137	visiting
strangers
266140	in
266142	nothing
else
spent their time
than
to tell
something
and
to hear
266151	something
new
Having stood
then
Paul
266157	in
266159	[the] midst
266161	of the
266163	Ares
Hill
he was saying
266167	Men
Athenians
266170	in
all things
266173	as
very religious
you
I behold
Passing through
for
and
beholding
266182	the
266184	objects of worship
of you
I found
266188	even
an altar
266191	on
which
had been inscribed
266195	To an unknown
God
Whom
therefore
not knowing
you worship
Him
I
proclaim
to you
266206	The
God
-
having made
266211	the
world
and
266215	all things
266217	that [are]
266219	in
it
He
266223	of heaven
and
earth
being
Lord
not
266230	in
266232	hand-made
temples
dwells
nor
266237	by
266239	hands
of men
is He served
as needing
anything
Himself
giving
to all
life
and
breath
and
266252	the
all
He made
then
266257	of
one
266260	every
266262	nation
of men
to dwell
266266	upon
266268	all
266270	the face
266272	of the
earth
having determined
266276	[the] appointed
times
and
266280	the
266282	boundaries
266284	of the
266286	habitation
of them
to seek
266290	-
God
if
perhaps
indeed
they might palpate for
Him
and
might find Him
And
indeed
266302	not
far
266305	from
266308	one
each
of us
He is
266313	In
Him
for
we live
and
move
and
are
As
266323	also
266325	some
266327	of the
266330	among
you
poets
have said
266335	Of [Him]
for
266338	also
offspring
we are
266342	Offspring
therefore
being
266346	-
of God
not
we ought
to consider
to gold
or
to silver
or
to stone
266357	a graven thing
266359	of craft
and
imagination
of man
266364	the
Divine Being
to be
like
266369	The
indeed
therefore
266373	times
266375	-
of ignorance
having overlooked
266379	-
God
266382	-
now
He commands
266386	-
men
266389	all
everywhere
to repent
because
He set
a day
266396	in
which
He is about
to judge
266401	the
world
266404	in
righteousness
266407	by
a man
whom
He appointed
a guarantee
having provided
to all
having raised
Him
266417	out from
[the] dead
Having heard of
now
266422	a resurrection
of [the] dead
some
indeed
began to mock [him]
some
however
said
We will hear
you
266433	concerning
this
266436	also
again
Thus
266440	-
Paul
went out
266444	from
266446	[the] midst
of them
266449	Some
however
men
having joined themselves
to him
believed
266456	among
whom
also
[were] Dionysius
266461	the
Areopagite
and
266465	a woman
named
Damaris
and
266470	others
266472	with
them
266475	And after
these things
having departed
266479	from
266481	-
Athens
he came
266485	to
Corinth
And
having found
266493	a certain
Jew
named
Aquila
of Pontus
266499	-
a native
recently
having come
266504	from
266506	-
Italy
266509	and
Priscilla
266512	wife
of him
266515	because of
-
having commanded
Claudius
to depart
266521	all
266523	the
Jews
266526	out of
266528	-
Rome
he came
to them
and
266534	due to
of the
same trade
being
he stayed
266540	with
them
and
worked
they were
for
tentmakers
266548	by the
trade
He was reasoning
now
266553	in
266555	the
synagogue
266558	on
266560	every
Sabbath
persuading
both
Jews
and
Greeks
When
now
came down
266571	from
266573	-
Macedonia
266576	-
both
Silas
and
266581	-
Timothy
was occupied
266585	with the
word
266588	-
Paul
earnestly testifying
266592	to the
Jews
to be
266596	the
Christ
Jesus
Opposing
however
of them
and
reviling [him]
having shaken out
266606	the
garments
he said
266610	to
them
266613	The
266615	blood
of You
266618	[be] upon
266620	the
266622	head
of you
clean
I [am]
266627	From
266629	-
now on
266632	to
266634	the
Gentiles
I will go
And
having departed
from there
he came
266642	to [the]
266644	house
266647	of a certain one
named
Titius
Justus
worshiping
266653	-
God
266656	of whom
266658	the
house
266661	was
adjoining
266664	the
synagogue
Crispus
now
266669	the
ruler of the synagogue
believed
266673	in the
Lord
266676	with
266678	all
266680	the
266682	household
of him
And
266686	many
266688	of the
Corinthians
hearing
believed
and
were baptized
Said
now
266697	the
Lord
266700	in [the]
night
266703	through
a vision
266706	-
to Paul
Not
fear
but
continue speaking
and
not
be silent
because
I
am
266719	with
you
and
no one
will lay a hand on
you
-
to harm
you
because
266730	people
there are
to me
many
266735	in
266738	the
city
this
He remained
now
a year
and
266746	months
six
teaching
266750	among
them
266753	the
266755	word
266757	-
of God
Gallio
however
266762	proconsul
being
266765	of
Achaia
rose up against
with one accord
266770	the
Jews
266773	-
Paul
and
led
him
266779	to
266781	the
judgment seat
saying
-
266786	Contrary to
266788	the
law
persuades
this [man]
266793	-
men
to worship
266797	-
God
Being about
now
266802	-
Paul
to open
266806	the
mouth
said
266810	-
Gallio
266813	to
266815	the
Jews
If
indeed
it was
266821	unrighteousness
some
or
266825	crime
wicked
266828	O
Jews
266831	according to
reason
-
I would have endured with
you
if
however
266839	a question
it is
266842	about
a word
and
names
and
law
266849	-
266851	in reference to
your
you will see
[to it] yourselves
266856	a judge
I
of these things

And
he drove
them
266866	from
266868	the
judgment seat
Having seized
then
all [of them]
Sosthenes
266875	the
ruler of the synagogue
they began to beat [him]
266879	before
266881	the
judgment seat
And
266885	nothing
about these things
266888	-
to Gallio
it mattered
266892	-
Now
Paul
more
having remained
266898	days
many
266901	the
brothers
having taken leave of
sailed away
266906	to
266908	-
Syria
and
266912	with
him
Priscilla
and
Aquila
having shaved
266919	in
Cenchrea
266922	the
head
he had
for
a vow
They came
now
266930	to
Ephesus
and them
left
there
He himself
then
having entered
266939	into
266941	the
synagogue
he reasoned
266945	with the
Jews
Asking [him]
now
of them
266951	for
266953	a longer
time
to remain
not
he did consent
but
having taken leave
and
having said
Again
I will return
266965	to
you
266968	-
God
willing
he sailed
266973	from
266975	-
Ephesus
and
having landed
266980	at
Caesarea
having gone up
and
having greeted
266986	the
church
he went down
266990	to
Antioch
And
having stayed
266995	time
some
he went forth
passing through
successively
267001	the
267003	Galatian
region
and
Phrygia
strengthening
267009	all
267011	the
disciples
267016	A Jew
now
certain
Apollos
named
of Alexandria
267023	-
a native
267026	a man
eloquent
came
267030	to
Ephesus
mighty
being
267035	in
267037	the
Scriptures
He
267041	was
instructed in
267044	the
267046	way
267048	of the
Lord
And
being fervent
267053	-
in spirit
he was speaking
and
was teaching
earnestly
267060	the things
267062	concerning
267064	-
Jesus
knowing
only
267069	the
267071	baptism
of John
He
then
began
to speak boldly
267078	in
267080	the
synagogue
Having heard
however
him
Priscilla
and
Aquila
they took to [them]
him
and
more accurately
to him
expounded
267095	the
267097	way
267099	of
God
Resolving
then
he
to pass through
267106	into
267108	-
Achaia
having encouraged [him]
267112	the
brothers
wrote
267116	to the
disciples
to welcome
him
who
having arrived
helped
greatly
those
having believed
267127	through
267129	-
grace
Powerfully
for
267134	the
Jews
he was refuting
publicly
showing
267140	by
267142	the
Scriptures
to be
267146	the
Christ
Jesus
It came to pass
now
267152	while
-
267155	-
Apollos
was
267159	in
Corinth
Paul
having passed through
267164	the
267166	upper
parts
to come
267170	to
Ephesus
and
having found
267175	certain
disciples
he said
also
267180	to
them
If
267184	[the] Spirit
Holy
did you receive
having believed
-
And [they said]
267191	to
him
But
not even
that [a]
267197	Spirit
Holy
there is
did we hear
He said
then
267204	Into
what
then
were you baptized
-
And
they said
267212	Into
267214	-
267216	John's
baptism
Said
then
Paul
John
baptized
267224	a baptism
of repentance
267227	the
people
telling
267231	in
the [One]
coming
267235	after
him
that
they should believe
that
is
267242	in
267244	-
Jesus
Having heard
then
they were baptized
267250	in
267252	the
267254	name
267256	of the
Lord
Jesus
And
having laid
on them
267263	-
Paul
hands
came
267268	the
267270	Spirit
267272	-
Holy
267275	upon
them
they were speaking
then
in tongues
and
prophesying
There were
then
267285	the
267287	in all
men
267290	about
twelve
Having entered
then
267295	into
267297	the
synagogue
he was speaking boldly
267301	for
267303	months
three
reasoning
and
persuading
267309	concerning
267311	the
267313	kingdom
267315	-
of God
When
however
some
were hardened
and
were disbelieving
speaking evil of
267325	the
Way
267328	before
267330	the
multitude
having departed
267334	from
them
he took separately
267338	the
disciples
267341	every
day
reasoning
267345	in
267347	the
267349	lecture hall
of Tyrannus
This
then
continued
267355	for
267357	years
two
so that
267361	all
those
inhabiting
267365	-
Asia
heard
267369	the
267371	word
267373	of the
Lord
Jews
both
and
Greeks
Miracles
then
267382	not
-
being ordinary
267386	-
God
was performing
267390	by
267392	the
267394	hands
of Paul
so that
267398	even
267400	to
the
ailing
were brought
267405	from
267407	the
267409	skin
of him
handkerchiefs
or
aprons
and
departed
267417	from
them
267420	the
diseases
267423	the
also
267426	spirits
267428	-
evil
left
Attempted
now
267434	some of
267436	also
267438	of the
267440	itinerant
267442	Jews
exorcists
to invoke
267446	over
those
having
267450	-
267452	spirits
267454	-
evil
267457	the
267459	name
267461	of the
Lord
Jesus
saying
I adjure
you
267468	[by]
Jesus
whom
Paul
proclaims
267474	They were
now
267478	certain
of Sceva
267481	a Jew
a high priest
267484	seven
sons
this
were doing
Answering
however
267491	the
267493	spirit
267495	-
evil
said
to them
267500	-
Jesus
I know
and
267505	-
Paul
I am acquainted with
you
however
who
are you
And
having leapt
267515	the
man
267518	on
them
267521	in
whom
was
267525	the
267527	spirit
267529	-
evil
having overpowered
them all
he prevailed
267535	against
them
so that
naked
and
wounded
they fled
267543	out of
267546	the
house
that
This
now
became
known
267554	to all
Jews
both
and
Greeks
those
inhabiting
267562	-
Ephesus
and
fell
fear
267568	upon
267570	all
them
and
was being magnified
267575	the
267577	name
267579	of the
Lord
Jesus
267583	Many
then
of those
having believed
were coming
confessing
and
declaring
267592	the
267594	deeds
of them
267597	Many
now
of those
267601	the
magic arts
having practiced
having brought
267606	the
books
burned [them]
267610	before
all
And
they counted up
267615	the
267617	prices
of them
and
found [it]
267622	of silverlings
267624	myriads
five
Thus
267628	with
might
267632	of the
Lord
267635	the
word
continued to increase
and
prevail
After
now
were fulfilled
these things
purposed
267646	-
Paul
267649	in
267651	the
Spirit
having passed through
267655	-
Macedonia
and
Achaia
to go
267661	to
Jerusalem
having said
-
267666	After
-
having been
my
there
it behooves
me
267674	also
Rome
to see
Having sent
then
267680	into
267682	-
Macedonia
267685	two
of those
ministering
to him
Timothy
and
Erastus
he
remained
for a time
267696	in
267698	-
Asia
Arose
now
267703	at
267706	the
time
same
267711	a disturbance
267713	not
small
267716	concerning
267718	the
Way
267721	Demetrius
for
a certain [man]
named
a silversmith
making
267729	shrines
silver
of Artemis
was bringing
267734	to the
craftsmen
267738	no
little
business
whom
having brought together
also
267745	the
267748	in
267750	such
things
workmen
he said
Men
you know
that
267758	from
267760	this
267762	-
business
267765	the
267767	wealth
of us
is
And
you see
and
hear
that
not
267777	only
in Ephesus
but
267781	almost
267783	all
267785	-
of Asia
267789	-
Paul
this
having persuaded [them]
has turned away
267795	a great many
people
saying
that
not
they are
gods
-
267804	by
hands
being made
Not
only
but
this
is endangered
to us
267814	the
business
267817	into
disrepute
to come
but
267822	also
267824	the
267827	of the
267829	great
goddess
Artemis
temple
267834	for
nothing
to be reckoned
to be
and
also
deposed
267842	the
267844	majesty
of her
whom
267848	all
267850	-
Asia
and
267854	the
world
worship
Having heard
then
and
having become
full
of rage
they were crying out
saying
Great [is]
267867	-
267869	Artemis
of [the] Ephesians
And
was filled
267874	the
city
267877	whole
with confusion
they rushed
and
with one accord
267883	to
267885	the
theatre
having dragged off
Gaius
and
Aristarchus
Macedonians
267893	fellow travelers
of Paul
Of Paul
however
intending
to go in
267900	to
267902	the
people
not
would allow
him
267908	the
disciples
267911	Some
then
267914	also
267916	of the
Asiarchs
being
to him
friends
having sent
267923	to
him
were urging [him]
not
to venture
himself
267930	into
267932	the
theatre
Others
indeed
therefore
267938	some
thing
were crying out
267942	was
for
267945	the
assembly
confused
and
267950	-
most
not
did know
267955	for what
cause
they were assembled
267959	Out of
now
267962	the
crowd
to explain himself
Alexander
having thrust forward
him
267969	the
Jews
267972	-
And
Alexander
having motioned with
267977	the
hand
was wanting
to make a defense
267982	to the
people
Having recognized
however
that
a Jew
he is
267990	a cry
there was
one
267994	from
all
267997	about
267999	ongoing
268001	hours
two
crying out
Great [is]
268006	-
268008	Artemis
of [the] Ephesians
Having calmed
then
268013	the
town clerk
268016	the
crowd
he says
268020	Men
Ephesians
268023	what
for
is there
man
who
not
knows
268031	the
268033	of [the] Ephesians
city
268036	temple-keeper
as being
268039	of the
268041	great
Artemis
and
268045	of that
fallen from the sky
Undeniable
therefore
being
these things
268052	necessary
it is
for you
calm
to be
and
268059	nothing
rash
to do
You brought
for
268066	the
men
these
neither
temple plunderers
nor
blaspheming
268074	the
268076	goddess
of us
If
indeed
therefore
Demetrius
and
268084	the
268087	with
him
craftsmen
have
268092	against
anyone
a matter
courts
are conducted
and
proconsuls
there are
let them accuse
one another
If
however
anything
beyond this
you inquire
268108	in
268110	the
268112	lawful
assembly
it will be solved
And
for
we are in danger of
being accused
of insurrection
268121	in regard to
268123	-
this day
268126	not one
cause
there existing
268130	concerning
which
not
we will be able
to give
a reason
268137	for
268140	the
commotion
this
And
these things
having said
he dismissed
268148	the
assembly
268151	After
now
-
had ceased
268156	the
uproar
having called to [him]
268160	-
Paul
268163	the
disciples
and
having encouraged
having said farewell
he departed
to go
268171	to
Macedonia
Having passed through
then
268177	the
districts
those
and
having exhorted
them
268184	with talk
much
he came
268188	to
268190	-
Greece
Having continued
then
268195	months
three
having been made
a plot
against him
268201	by
268203	the
Jews
he being about
to sail
268208	into
268210	-
Syria
arose
a purpose
-
to return
268217	through
Macedonia
Was accompanied by
then
he
268224	Sopater
Pyrrhus
a Berean
268228	of the Thessalonians
now
Aristarchus
and
Secundus
and
268235	Gaius
of Derbe
and
Timothy
[the] Asians
now
Tychicus
and
Trophimus
These
also
having gone ahead
waited for
us
268250	in
Troas
We
then
sailed away
268256	after
268258	the
268260	days
268262	of the
Unleavened Bread
268265	from
Philippi
and
we came
268270	to
them
268273	at
268275	-
Troas
268278	within
268280	days
five
where
we stayed
268285	days
seven
268288	In
then
268291	the
268293	first [day]
268295	of the
week
having come together
we
to break
bread
268302	-
Paul
talked
to them
about
to depart
268309	on the
next day
he continued
then
268314	the
talk
268317	until
midnight
There were
now
268322	lamps
many
268325	in
268327	the
upper room
where
268331	we were
assembled
Was sitting
then
268337	a certain
young man
named
Eutychus
268342	by
268344	the
window
overpowered
268348	by sleep
deep
as talked
268352	-
Paul
268355	on
longer
having been overpowered
268359	by
268361	the
sleep
he fell
268365	from
268367	the
third story
down
and
was picked up
dead
Having descended
however
268376	-
Paul
fell upon
him
and
having embraced [him]
said
Not
be alarmed
268386	the
for
268389	life
of him
268392	in
him
is
Having gone up
then
and
having broken
268400	the
bread
and
having eaten
268405	for
long
and
having talked
268410	until
daybreak
so
he departed
They brought
then
268417	the
boy
alive
and
were comforted
268423	not
a little
We
however
having gone ahead
268429	to
268431	the
ship
sailed
268435	to
268437	-
Assos
there
being about
to take in
268443	-
Paul
Thus
for
268448	having arranged
he was
readying
himself
to go on foot
When
now
he met with
us
268458	at
268460	-
Assos
having taken in
him
we came
268466	to
Mitylene
And from there
having sailed away
on the
following [day]
we arrived
268474	opposite
Chios
268477	-
then
the next [day]
we arrived
268482	at
Samos
the
now
following [day]
we came
268489	to
Miletus
Had decided
for
268494	-
Paul
to sail by
268498	-
Ephesus
so that
not
it might come upon
to him
to spend time
268506	in
268508	-
Asia
he was hastened
for
if
possible
it was
for him
268517	on the
268519	day
268521	-
of Pentecost
to be
268525	in
Jerusalem
268528	From
then
268531	-
Miletus
having sent
268535	to
Ephesus
he called for
268539	the
268541	elders
268543	of the
church
When
then
they had come
268549	to
him
he said
to them
You
know
268556	from
268558	the first
day
268561	on
which
I arrived
268565	in
268567	-
Asia
how
268571	with
you
268574	the
268576	whole
time
I was
serving
268581	the
Lord
268584	with
268586	all
humility
and
tears
and
trials
-
having befallen
me
268596	in
268598	the
268600	plots
268602	of the
Jews
how
268606	nothing
I did shrink back
of that
being profitable
-
not
to declare
to you
and
to teach
you
publicly
and
268620	from
house to house
earnestly testifying
to the Jewish
both
and
to Greeks
268628	-
268631	in
God
repentance
and
268636	faith
268638	in
268640	the
268642	Lord
of us
Jesus
And
now
behold
bound
I
268651	in the
Spirit
go
268655	to
Jerusalem
what
268659	in
it
will happen
to me
not
knowing
except
that
268668	the
268670	Spirit
268672	-
Holy
268675	in every
city
fully testifies
to me
saying
that
chains
and
tribulations
me
await
But
268688	not any
account
I make
268692	my
life
268695	dear
to myself
so as
to finish
268700	the
268702	course
of me
and
268706	the
ministry
that
I received
268711	from
268713	the
Lord
Jesus
to testify fully
268718	the
268720	gospel
268722	of the
268724	grace
268726	-
of God
And
now
behold
I
know
that
no more
you will see
268737	the
268739	face
of me
268742	you
all
268745	among
whom
I have gone about
proclaiming
268750	the
kingdom
Therefore
I testify
to you
268756	in
268758	-
268760	this
day
that
innocent
I [am]
268766	of
268768	the
268770	blood
of all
not
for
I shrunk back
-
not
from declaring
268779	all
268781	the
268783	counsel
268785	-
of God
to you
Take heed
to yourselves
and
268792	to all
268794	the
flock
268797	among
which
you
268801	the
268803	Spirit
268805	-
Holy
has set
overseers
to shepherd
268811	the
268813	church
268815	-
of God
which
He purchased
268820	with
268822	-
268824	blood
268826	the
own
I
know
that
will come in
268833	after
268835	the
268837	departure
of me
268840	wolves
grievous
268843	among
you
not
sparing
268848	the
flock
and
268852	out from
268854	your own
selves
will rise up
men
speaking
perverse things
-
to draw away
268863	-
disciples
268866	after
them
Therefore
stay awake
remembering
that
three years
night
and
day
not
I ceased
268879	with
tears
admonishing
268883	one
each
And
268887	-
now
I commit
you
268892	to
God
and
268896	to the
268898	word
268900	of the
268902	grace
of Him
-
being able
to build up
and
to give
268910	you
an inheritance
268913	among
268915	those
having been sanctified
all
268919	Silver
or
gold
or
clothing
of no one
I coveted
You yourselves
know
that
268930	the
268932	needs
of me
and
to those
being
268938	with
me
ministered to
268943	the
hands
these
In everything
I showed
you
that
by thus
straining
it behooves [us]
to aid
those
being weak
to remember
and also
268959	the
268961	words
268963	of the
Lord
Jesus
how
He Himself
said
Blessed
it is
more
to give
than
to receive
And
these things
having said
having bowed
268980	the
268982	knee
of him
268985	with
268987	all
them
he prayed
Much
then
268993	weeping
there was
among all
and
having fallen
268999	upon
269001	the
269003	neck
269005	-
of Paul
they were kissing
him
sorrowing
especially
269012	over
269014	the
word
that
he had spoken
that
no more
they are about
269022	the
269024	face
of him
to see
They accompanied
then
him
269031	to
269033	the
ship
After
then
it happened
sailing
our
having drawn away
269042	from
them
having run directly
we came
269047	to
269049	-
Cos
269052	-
and
the next [day]
269056	to
269058	-
Rhodes
and from there
269062	to
Patara
And
having found
269067	a boat
passing over
269070	into
Phoenicia
having gone on board
we set sail
Having sighted
then
269077	-
Cyprus
and
having left
it
on the left
we kept sailing
269085	to
Syria
and
landed
269090	at
Tyre
There
for
269095	the
ship
269098	was
unloading
269101	the
cargo
Having sought out
then
269106	the
disciples
we remained
there
269111	days
seven
who
269115	-
to Paul
kept telling
269119	through
269121	the
Spirit
not
to go up
269126	to
Jerusalem
When
then
it happened that
had completed
we
269134	the
days
having set out
we journeyed
accompanying
us
all
269142	with
wives
and
children
269147	as far as
269149	outside
269151	the
city
And
having bowed
269156	the
knees
269159	on
269161	the
shore
having prayed
having said farewell
to one another
then
we went up
269169	into
269171	the
boat
they
then
returned
269177	to
269179	the
own
We
then
269184	the
voyage
having completed
269188	from
Tyre
came down
269192	to
Ptolemais
and
having greeted
269197	the
brothers
we stayed
269201	day
one
269204	with
them
269207	On the
now
next day
having gone forth
we came
269213	to
Caesarea
and
having entered
269218	into
269220	the
269222	house
269224	of Philip
269226	the
evangelist
being
269230	of
269232	the
seven
we stayed
269236	with
him
With this [man]
now
there were
269242	daughters
four
virgins
prophesying
Remaining
now
269249	days
many
came down
269253	a certain one
269255	from
269257	-
Judea
269260	a prophet
named
Agabus
and
having come
269266	to
us
and
having taken
269271	the
269273	belt
269275	-
of Paul
having bound
269279	of himself
269281	the
feet
and
269285	the
hands
he said
Thus
says
269291	the
269293	Spirit
269295	-
Holy
269298	The
man
of whom
is
269304	the
belt
this
in this way
will bind
269310	in
Jerusalem
269313	the
Jews
and
will deliver [him]
269318	into
269320	[the] hands
of [the] Gentiles
When
then
we had heard
these things
began begging
we
both
and
269331	those
of that place
-
not
to go up
him
269338	to
Jerusalem
Then
answered
269343	-
Paul
What
are you doing
weeping
and
breaking
269351	my
269353	-
heart
I
for
not
only
to be bound
but
also
to die
269364	at
Jerusalem
readiness
have
269369	for
269371	the
269373	name
269375	of the
Lord
Jesus
Not
being persuaded
then
of him
we were silent
having said
269386	Of the
Lord
269389	the
will
be done
269393	After
now
269397	the
days
these
having packed the baggage
we started on our way up
269403	to
Jerusalem
Went
then
269408	also [some]
269410	of the
269412	disciples
269414	from
Caesarea
269417	with
us
bringing [one]
269421	with
whom
we would lodge
Mnason
269426	a certain
Cypriot
269429	an early
disciple
Having arrived
now
we
269435	at
Jerusalem
gladly
received
us
269441	the
brothers
On the
now
following [day]
went in
269448	-
Paul
269451	with
us
269454	unto
James
269457	all
and
arrived
269461	the
elders
And
having greeted
them
he began to relate
269468	by
one
269471	each
the things
had done
269475	-
God
269478	among
269480	the
Gentiles
269483	through
269485	the
269487	ministry
of him
Those
then
having heard
began glorifying
269494	-
God
They said
then
to him
You see
brother
269502	how many
269504	myriads
there are
269507	among
269509	the
Jews
-
having believed
and
all
269516	zealous ones
269518	for the
law
are
They have been informed
now
269524	about
you
that
269528	apostasy
you teach
269531	from
Moses
269534	those
269537	among
269539	the
Gentiles
269542	all
Jews
telling
not
to circumcise
them
269549	the
children
nor
269553	in the
customs
to walk
What
then
is it
Certainly
they will hear
that
you have come
This
therefore
do you
what
to you
we say
There are
with us
269573	men
four
a vow
having
269578	on
themselves
These [men]
having taken
be purified
269584	with
them
and
bear expense
269589	for
them
so that
they will shave
269594	the
head
and
will know
all
that
of which
they have been informed
269603	about
you
nothing
is
but
you walk orderly
269610	also
yourself
keeping
269614	the
law
269617	Concerning
now
269620	those
269622	having believed
of the Gentiles
we
wrote
having adjudged
to keep from
them
269630	the things
both
sacrificed to idols
and
blood
and
what is strangled
and
sexual immorality
Then
269641	-
Paul
having taken
269645	the
men
269648	on the
269650	following
day
269653	with
them
having been purified
entered
269658	into
269660	the
temple
declaring
269664	the
269666	fulfillment
269668	of the
269670	days
269672	of the
purification
269675	until
that
was offered
269679	for
269682	one
each
of them
269686	the
sacrifice
When
now
were about
269692	the
269694	seven
days
to be completed
269698	the
269701	from
269703	-
Asia
Jews
having seen
him
269709	in
269711	the
temple
began stirring up
269715	all
269717	the
crowd
and
laid
269722	upon
him
269725	the
hands
crying out
Men
Israelites
help
This
is
269734	the
man
who
269738	against
269740	the
people
and
269744	the
law
and
269749	the
place
this
all those
everywhere
teaching
besides
and
269758	also
Greeks
he has brought
269762	into
269764	the
temple
and
defiled
269770	the
269772	holy
place
this
269776	It was they
for
having previously seen
Trophimus
269781	the
Ephesian
269784	in
269786	the
city
269789	with
him
whom
they were supposing
that
269795	into
269797	the
temple
had brought
269801	-
Paul
Was thrown into commotion
also
269807	the
city
whole
and
there was
269813	a rushing together
269815	of the
people
And
having laid hold
269820	-
of Paul
they dragged
him
269825	outside
269827	the
temple
and
immediately
were shut
269833	the
doors
Of them seeking
then
him
to kill
there came
a report
269842	to the
269844	commander
269846	of the
cohort
that
269850	all
was in an uproar
Jerusalem
who
at once
having taken with [him]
soldiers
and
centurions
ran down
269861	upon
them
-
And
having seen
269867	the
commander
and
269871	the
soldiers
they stopped
beating
269876	-
Paul
Then
having drawn near
269881	the
commander
laid hold
of him
and
commanded [him]
to be bound
269889	with chains
two
and
began inquiring
who
he might be
and
what
269898	it is
he has been doing
Others
however
269903	another [or]
one thing
were crying out
269907	in
269909	the
crowd
Not
being able
now
he
to know
269917	the
facts
269920	on account of
269922	the
uproar
he ordered
to be brought
him
269928	into
269930	the
barracks
When
now
he came
269936	to
269938	the
stairs
it happened that
was carried
he
269944	by
269946	the
soldiers
269949	because of
269951	the
269953	violence
269955	of the
crowd
Were following
for
269960	the
269962	multitude
269964	of the
people
crying out
Away with
him
Being about
then
to be brought
269973	into
269975	the
barracks
269978	-
Paul
says
269982	to the
commander
If
is it permitted
to me
to say
something
269990	to
you
-
Then
he was saying
Greek
do you know
Not
then
you
are
270002	the
Egyptian
-
270006	before
270008	these
270010	the
days
having led a revolt
and
having led out
270016	into
270018	the
wilderness
270021	the
270023	four thousand
270025	men
270027	of the
Assassins
Said
however
270032	-
Paul
I
a man
indeed
am
a Jew
270040	of Tarsus
270042	-
of Cilicia
270047	not [of an]
insignificant
city
a citizen
I implore
now
you
allow
me
to speak
270058	to
270060	the
people
Having allowed [him]
then
he
270066	-
Paul
having stood
270070	on
270072	the
stairs
made a sign
270076	with the
hand
270079	to the
people
270082	great
then
silence
having taken place
he spoke to [them]
270088	in the
Hebrew
language
saying
Men
brothers
and
fathers
hear
270098	of me
270100	the
270103	to
you
270106	now
defense
Having heard
then
that
270112	in the
Hebrew
language
he was addressing
them
even more
they became
quiet
And
he says
I
am
270125	a man
a Jew
born
270129	in
270131	Tarsus
270133	-
of Cilicia
brought up
now
270138	in
270141	the
city
this
270145	at
270147	the
270149	feet
of Gamaliel
having been instructed
270153	according to [the]
270155	exactness
270157	of the
270159	of our Fathers
law
270162	a zealous one
being
270165	-
for God
even as
270169	all
you
are
this day
who
270175	this
270177	-
Way
persecuted
270181	as far as
death
binding
and
betraying
270187	to
prisons
men
both
and
women
as
270195	also
270197	the
high priest
bears witness
to me
and
270203	all
270205	the
elderhood
270208	from
whom
270211	also
letters
having received
270215	to
270217	the
brothers
270220	to
Damascus
I was on my way
to bring
270225	also
those
there
being
bound
270231	to
Jerusalem
in order that
they might be punished
It happened
however
to me
journeying
and
drawing near
270242	-
to Damascus
270245	about
noon
suddenly
270249	out of
270251	-
heaven
shone
270255	a light
great
270258	around
me
I fell
then
270263	to
270265	the
ground
and
heard
a voice
saying
to me
Saul
Saul
why
Me
persecute you
I
then
answered
Who
are You
Lord
He said
then
270286	to
me
I
am
Jesus
270292	of
Nazareth
whom
you
are persecuting
Those
then
270300	with
me
being
270304	the
indeed
light
beheld
270309	the
however
270312	voice
not
did they hear
of the [One]
speaking
to me
I said
then
What
shall I do
Lord
270324	-
And
the Lord
said
270329	to
me
Having risen up
go
270334	to
Damascus
and there
you
it will be told
270340	concerning
270342	all things
that
it has been appointed
you
to do
While
now
not
I could see
270352	from
270354	the
270356	brightness
270359	of the
light
that
being led by the hand
270364	by
those
being with
me
I came
270370	to
Damascus
270373	Ananias
then
certain
270378	a man
270380	devout
270382	according to
270384	the
law
borne witness to
270388	by
270390	all
270392	the
270394	dwelling [there]
Jews
having come
270398	to
me
and
having stood by [me]
said
to me
Saul
brother
receive your sight
And I
270409	the same
270411	-
hour
looked up
270415	at
him
-
And
he said
270421	The
270423	God
270425	of the
270427	fathers
of us
has appointed
you
to know
270433	the
270435	will
of Him
and
to see
270440	the
Righteous One
and
to hear
270445	[the] voice
270447	out of
270449	the
270451	mouth
of Him
For
you will be
270456	a witness
for Him
270459	to
270461	all
men
of what
you have seen
and
heard
And
now
why
delay you
Having arisen
be baptized
and
wash away
270476	the
270478	sins
of you
calling on
270482	the
270484	name
of Him
It happened
then
to me
having returned
270491	to
Jerusalem
and
praying
of my
270497	in
270499	the
temple
fell
I
270504	into
a trance
and
saw
Him
saying
to me
Make haste
and
go away
270515	with
speed
270518	out of
Jerusalem
because
not
they will receive
270524	your
270526	testimony
270528	about
Me
And I
said
Lord
they themselves
know
that
I
270538	was
imprisoning
and
beating
270543	in each
270545	of those
synagogues
those
believing
270550	on
You
And
when
was poured out
270556	the
270558	blood
of Stephen
270561	the
270563	witness
of You
270566	also
I myself
270569	was
standing by
and
consenting
and
watching over
270576	the
270578	garments
of those
killing
him
And
He said
270585	to
me
Go
for
I
270591	to
[the] Gentiles
far away
will send
you
They were listening
now
to him
270600	until
270602	this
270604	-
word
and
they lifted up
270609	the
270611	voice
of them
saying
Away with
270616	from
270618	the
earth
270621	the
such
Not
for
it is fit
he
to live
Were crying out
then
they
and
casting off
270634	the
garments
and
dust
throwing
270640	into
270642	the
air
Ordered
270646	the
commander
to be brought
him
270651	into
270653	the
barracks
having directed
by flogging
to be examined
him
so that
he might know
270662	for
270664	what
cause
like this
they were crying out
against him
As
however
he stretched forward
him
270674	with the
straps
said
270678	to
270680	the
270682	standing by
centurion
270685	-
Paul
If
270689	a man
a Roman
and
uncondemned
it is lawful
to you
to flog
Having heard
then
270699	the
centurion
having gone
270703	to the
commander
he reported [it]
saying
What
are you going
to do
270712	The
for
man
this
a Roman
is
Having come near
then
270721	the
commander
said
to him
Tell
me
you
a Roman
are
-
And
he was saying
Yes
Answered
then
270737	the
commander
I
270741	with a great
sum
270745	the
citizenship
this
bought
270750	-
But
Paul
was saying
I
however
even
was born [so]
Immediately
therefore
departed
270762	from
him
those
being about
him
to examine
270769	and
270771	the
commander
also
was afraid
having ascertained
that
a Roman
he is
and
because
him
270783	he had
bound
270786	On the
now
next day
desiring
to know
270792	-
for certain
-
why
he is accused
270798	by
270800	the
Jews
he unbound
him
and
commanded
to assemble
270808	the
chief priests
and
270812	all
270814	the
council
And
having brought down
270819	-
Paul
he set [him]
270823	among
them
Having looked intently
then
270828	-
Paul
270831	Council
he said
Men
brothers
I
in all
270838	conscience
270840	good
have lived as a citizen
-
270844	to God
unto
270847	this
270849	-
270851	day

270854	-
Then
the high priest
Ananias
commanded
those
standing by
him
to strike
270864	of him
270866	the
mouth
Then
270870	-
Paul
270873	to
him
said
To strike
you
is about
270880	-
God
270883	wall
whitewashed
270886	And
you
do you sit
judging
me
270892	according to
270894	the
law
and
violating law
command
me
to be struck
Those who
now
stood by
said
270906	The
270908	high priest
270910	-
of God
do you insult
Was saying
then
270916	-
Paul
Not
I was aware
brothers
that
he is
high priest
it has been written
for
-
270928	[The] ruler
270930	of the
270932	people
of you
not
you shall speak
evil [of]
Having known
then
270940	-
Paul
that
270944	the
270946	one
part
consists
of Sadducees
270951	-
but
the other
of Pharisees
he began crying out
270957	in
270959	the
Council
Men
brothers
I
a Pharisee
am
270967	[the] son
of a Pharisee
270970	concerning
[the] hope
and
270974	resurrection
of [the] dead
am judged
This
then
of him
saying
arose
270983	a dissension
270985	between the
Pharisees
and
Sadducees
and
was divided
270992	the
crowd
Sadducees
for
say
not
there to be
resurrection
nor
angel
nor
spirit
Pharisees
however
confess
271008	-
both
Arose
then
271013	a clamor
great
and
having risen up
271018	some
271020	of the
271022	scribes
271024	of the
271026	party
271028	of the
Pharisees
they were contending
saying
271033	Nothing
evil
we find
271037	in
271040	the
man
this
What if
now
a spirit
has spoken
to him
or
an angel
271051	Great
then
arising
dissension
having feared
271057	the
commander
lest
should be torn to pieces
271062	-
Paul
271065	by
them
he commanded
271069	the
troop
having gone down
to take by force
him
271075	from
271077	midst
of them
to bring [him]
then
271082	into
271084	the
barracks
271087	-
But
271090	the following
night
having stood by
him
271095	the
Lord
said
Take courage
as
for
you have fully testified
271103	-
271105	about
Me
271108	at
Jerusalem
so
you
it behooves
271114	also
271116	in
Rome
to testify
When it was
then
day
having made
a conspiracy
271125	the
Jews
put under an oath
themselves
declaring
neither
to eat
nor
to drink
271135	until
that
they should kill
271139	-
Paul
There were
now
271144	more than
forty
-
271148	this
271150	-
plot
having made
who
having come
271156	to the
chief priests
and
271160	the
elders
said
With an oath
we have bound
ourselves
nothing
to eat
271169	until
that
we should kill
271173	-
Paul
Now
therefore
you
make a report
271180	to the
commander
271183	along with
271185	the
Council
so that
he might bring down
him
271191	to
you
as
being about
to examine
more earnestly
271198	the things
271200	about
him
we
then
271205	before
-
drawing near
his
ready
are
-
to kill
him
Having heard
however
271217	the
271219	son
271221	of the
271223	sister
of Paul
271226	of the
ambush
having come near
and
having entered
271232	into
271234	the
barracks
he reported [it]
271238	-
to Paul
Having called to [him]
then
271243	-
Paul
271246	one
271248	of the
centurions
he was saying
271253	The
young man
this
take
271258	to
271260	the
commander
he has
for
to report
something
to him
The [one]
indeed
therefore
having taken
him
brought [him]
271274	to
271276	the
commander
and
he says
271281	The
prisoner
Paul
having called to
me
asked [me]
271288	this
271290	-
young man
to lead
271294	to
you
having
something
to say
to you
Having taken hold
then
271303	the
271305	hand
of him
271308	the
commander
and
having withdrawn
271313	in
private
he began to inquire
What
is it
that
you have
to report
to me
He said
then
-
271326	The
Jews
have agreed
-
to ask
you
that
tomorrow
271335	-
Paul
you might bring down
271339	into
271341	the
Council
as
being about
something
more earnestly
to inquire
271349	about
him
You
therefore
not
should be persuaded
by them
Lie in wait
indeed
for him
271361	of
them
271364	men
271366	more than
forty
who
have put under an oath
themselves
neither
to eat
nor
to drink
271376	until
that
they have killed
him
and
now
they are
ready
awaiting
271386	the
271389	from
you
promise
271393	-
Indeed
therefore
the commander
dismissed
271399	the
young man
having instructed [him]
No one
tell
that
these things
you have reported
271408	to
me
And
having called to [him]
271414	certain
two
271417	of the
centurions
he said
Prepare
271422	soldiers
two hundred
so that
they might go
271427	as far as
Caesarea
and
271431	horsemen
seventy
and
271435	spearmen
two hundred
271438	for
271440	the third
271442	hour
271444	of the
night
Mounts
then
provide
so that
having set upon [them]
271452	-
Paul
they might bring [him] safely
271456	to
Felix
271459	the
governor
having written
271463	a letter
having
271467	the
form
this
Claudius
Lysias
271473	To the
271475	most excellent
governor
Felix
Greetings
271481	The
man
this
having been seized
271486	by
271488	the
Jews
and
being about
to be killed
271494	by
them
having come up
271498	with
271500	the
troop
I rescued [him]
having learned
that
a Roman
he is
Resolving
then
to know
271511	the
charge
271514	on account of
which
they were accusing
him
I brought [him] down
271520	to
271522	the
271524	council
of them
whom
I found
being accused
271530	concerning
271532	questions
271534	of the
271536	law
of them
271539	no
however
271543	worthy
of death
or
of chains
having
accusation
It having been disclosed
then
to me
of a plot that
271554	against
271556	the
man
would be
at once
I sent [him]
271562	to
you
having instructed
271566	also
271568	the
accusers
to speak
271572	against
him
271575	before
you
271578	-
Indeed
therefore
the soldiers
271583	according to
that
having been ordered
them
having taken
271589	-
Paul
brought [him]
271593	by
night
271596	to
271598	-
Antipatris
271601	On the
now
next day
having allowed
271606	the
horsemen
to go
271610	with
him
they returned
271614	to
271616	the
barracks
who
having entered
271621	into
271623	-
Caesarea
and
having delivered
271628	the
letter
271631	to the
governor
presented
271635	also
271637	-
Paul
to him
Having read [it]
then
and
having asked
271645	from
271647	what
province
he is
and
having learned
that
271654	from
Cilicia [he is]
I will hear fully
you
he was saying
when
271661	also
271663	the
271665	accusers
of you
may have arrived
having commanded
271670	in
271672	the
271674	Praetorium
271676	-
of Herod
to be guarded
him
271681	After
then
271684	five
days
came down
271688	the
high priest
Ananias
271692	with
271694	elders
some
and
271698	an orator
Tertullus
certain
who
made a representation
271704	to the
governor
271707	against
271709	-
Paul
Having been called
then
of him
began
to accuse
271717	-
Tertullus
saying
271721	Great
peace
we are attaining
271725	through
you
and
excellent measures
are being done
271732	to the
nation
this
271736	through
271738	-
271740	your
foresight
in every way
both
and
everywhere
we gladly accept [it]
271748	most excellent
Felix
271751	with
271753	all
thankfulness
In order that
however
not
271759	to
any longer
you
I should be a hindrance
I implore
to hear
you
us
briefly
271769	[in]
271771	your
kindness
Having found
for
271777	the
man
this
a pest
and
stirring
insurrection
271785	among all
271787	the
Jews
271790	-
271792	in
271794	the
world
271797	a leader
then
271800	of the
271803	of the
Nazarenes
sect
who
even
271809	the
temple
attempted
to profane
whom
also
we seized
271817	From
him
you will be able
yourself
having examined [him]
271823	concerning
271825	all
these things
to know
of which
we
accuse
him
Agreed
then
271835	also
271837	the
Jews
declaring
these things
so
to be
Answered
then
271846	-
Paul
having made a sign
to him
271851	the
governor
to speak
271855	For
271857	many
years
as being
you
judge
271864	to
nation
this
knowing
cheerfully
271870	to the things
271872	concerning
myself
I make a defense
Being able
you
to know
that
not
more than
there are
to me
271884	days
twelve
271887	from
which
I went up
to worship
271892	in
Jerusalem
And
neither
271897	in
271899	the
temple
did they find
me
271904	with
anyone
reasoning
or
271909	a tumultuous gathering
making
of a crowd
nor
271914	in
271916	the
synagogues
nor
271920	in
271922	the
city
Nor
to prove
are they able
to you
271929	concerning
[the things] of which
now
they accuse
me
I confess
however
this
to you
that
271940	according to
271942	the
Way
which
they call
a sect
so
I serve
271950	the
271952	of our fathers
God
believing
271956	all things
271958	-
271960	throughout
271962	the
law
and
that
271967	in
271969	the
Prophets
have been written
271973	a hope
having
271976	in
271978	-
God
which
271982	also
271984	they
themselves
await
271988	[that] a resurrection
there is about
to be
of [the] just
both
and
of [the] unjust
271996	In
this
271999	also
I myself
strive
272003	without offense
a conscience
to have
272007	toward
272009	-
God
and
272013	-
men
272016	through
everything
272019	After
272021	years
now
many
alms
to bring
272027	to
272029	the
272031	nation
of me
I arrived
and
offerings
272037	during
which
they found
me
purified
272043	in
272045	the
temple
not
272049	with
a crowd
nor
272053	in
tumult
272056	Some
however [are]
272060	from
272062	-
Asia
Jews
who
ought
272068	before
you
to appear
and
to make accusation
if
anything
they may have
272077	against
me
Otherwise
272081	themselves
it
let them say
272085	any
they found
unrighteousness
having stood
in me
272091	before
272093	the
Council
[other] than
272097	concerning
one
272100	this
voice
which
I cried out
272105	among
them
standing
-
272110	Concerning
272112	[the] resurrection
of [the] dead
I
am judged
this day
272118	by
you
Put off
however
them
272124	-
Felix
more precisely
having knowledge of
272129	the things
272131	concerning
272133	the
Way
having said
When
Lysias
272139	the
commander
might have come down
I will examine
272144	the things
272146	as to
you
having commanded
272150	the
centurion
to keep
him
to [let him] have
then
ease
and
272159	not
to forbid
272162	the
272164	own
of him
to minister
to him
272169	After
then
272172	days
some
having arrived
272176	-
Felix
272179	with
272181	Drusilla
272183	the
272185	own
wife
being
a Jewess
he sent for
272191	-
Paul
and
heard
him
272197	concerning
272199	the
272202	in
Christ
Jesus
faith
Reasoning
then
he
272210	concerning
righteousness
and
self-control
and
272216	the
judgment
-
coming
frightened
having become
272223	-
Felix
answered
For the
present
being
go away
opportunity
then
having found
I will call for
you
At the same time
also
he is hoping
that
riches
will be given
him
272243	by
272245	-
Paul
Therefore
also
often
him
sending for
he was talking
with him
Two years
however
having been completed
received [as]
successor
272260	-
Felix
Porcius
Festus
wishing
then
favor
to acquire for himself
272269	with the
Jews
272272	-
Felix
left
272276	-
Paul
imprisoned
Festus
therefore
having arrived in
272283	the
province
272286	after
272288	three
days
he went up
272292	to
Jerusalem
272295	from
Caesarea
Made a presentation before
then
him
272301	the
chief priests
and
272305	the
272307	chiefs
272309	of the
Jews
272312	against
272314	-
Paul
and
they were begging
him
asking
a favor
272322	against
him
that
he would summon
him
272328	to
Jerusalem
an ambush
forming
to kill
him
272335	on
272337	the
way
272340	-
Indeed
therefore
Festus
answered that
is to be kept
272347	-
Paul
272350	in
Caesarea
he himself
now
is about
272356	in
quickness
to set out
272360	Those
therefore
272364	among
you
he says
[those] in power
having gone down too
if
anything
there is
272373	in
272375	the
man
wrong
let them accuse
him
Having spent
then
272383	with
them
272386	days
272388	not
272390	more than
eight
or
ten
having gone down
272396	to
Caesarea
272399	on the
next day
having sat
272403	on
272405	the
judgment seat
he commanded
272409	-
Paul
to be brought
Having arrived
then
he
stood around
him
272418	the
272421	from
Jerusalem
having come down
Jews
272426	many
and
weighty
charges
bringing
which
not
they were able
to prove
272436	-
Paul
made his defense
-
Neither
272442	against
272444	the
272446	law
272448	of the
Jews
nor
272452	against
272454	the
temple
nor
272458	against
Caesar
[in] anything
have I sinned
272463	-
Festus
however
wishing
272468	on the
Jews
a favor
to lay
answering
272474	-
Paul
said
Are you willing
272479	to
Jerusalem
having gone up
there
272484	concerning
these things
to be judged
272488	before
me
Said
then
272493	-
Paul
272496	Standing
272498	before
272500	the
272502	judgment seat
of Caesar
I am
where
me
it behooves
to be judged
To [the] Jews
nothing
I have done wrong
as
272514	also
you
very well
know
If
indeed
therefore
I do wrong
and
272525	worthy
of death
have done
anything
not
I do refuse
-
to die
If
however
nothing
there is
of which
they
[can] accuse
me
no one
me
can
to them
give up
To Caesar
I appeal
Then
272550	-
Festus
having conferred
272554	with
272556	the
Council
answered
To Caesar
You have appealed
272562	to
Caesar
you will go
272566	Days
now
having passed
some
Agrippa
272572	the
king
and
Bernice
came down
272578	to
Caesarea
greeting
272582	-
Festus
As
now
272587	many
days
they stayed
there
272592	-
Festus
272595	the
king
laid before
272599	the things
272601	relating to
272603	-
Paul
saying
272607	A man
certain
there is
272611	left
272613	by
Felix
[as] a prisoner
272617	concerning
whom
having been
my
272622	in
Jerusalem
made a presentation
272626	the
chief priests
and
272630	the
272632	elders
272634	of the
Jews
asking
272638	against
him
judgment
272642	to
whom
I answered
that
not
it is
[the] custom
with Romans
to give up
272652	any
man
before
that
the [one]
being accused
272659	to
face
may have [it]
272663	the
accusers
272666	[the] opportunity
and
of defense
he may have
272671	concerning
272673	the
accusation
Having come together
therefore
here
272679	delay
no
having made
272683	the
next [day]
having sat
272687	on
272689	the
judgment seat
I commanded
to be brought
272694	the
man
272697	concerning
whom
having stood up
272701	the
accusers
272704	no
272706	charge
were bringing
of which
I
was expecting
crimes
272713	Questions
however
certain
272717	concerning
272719	the
272721	own
religion
they had
272725	against
him
and
272729	concerning
272732	a certain
Jesus
having been dead
whom
was affirming
272738	-
Paul
to be alive
Being perplexed
now
I
272745	-
272748	concerning
this
inquiry
was asking
if
he was willing
to go
272756	to
Jerusalem
and there
to be judged
272761	concerning
these things
272764	-
But
of Paul
having appealed for
to be kept
himself
272771	for
272773	the
272776	-
Emperor's
decision
I commanded
to be kept
him
272783	until
that
I might send
him
272788	to
Caesar
Agrippa
then
272793	[said] to
272795	-
Festus
I have been wanting
272799	also
myself
272802	the
man
to hear
Tomorrow
he says
you will hear
him
272810	On the
therefore
next day
having come
272815	-
Agrippa
and
272819	-
Bernice
272822	with
272824	great
pomp
and
having entered
272829	into
272831	the
audience hall
272834	with
both
[the] commanders
and
272839	men
272841	-
272843	in
prominence
272846	in the
city
and
having commanded
272851	-
Festus
was brought in
272855	-
Paul
And
says
272860	-
Festus
Agrippa
King
and
272866	all
272868	the
272870	being present with
us
men
you see
this one
272876	concerning
whom
272879	all
272881	the
272883	multitude
272885	of the
Jews
pleaded
with me
272890	in
both
Jerusalem
and
here
crying out [that]
not
he ought
of him
to live
no longer
I
however
having understood
272905	nothing
272907	worthy
him
of death
to have done
272912	himself
and
of this one
having appealed to
272917	the
Emperor
I determined
to send [him]
272922	concerning
whom
272925	definite
anything
to write
272929	to
[my] lord
not
I have
Therefore
I have brought
him
272937	before
you all
and
272941	especially
272943	before
you
King
Agrippa
so that
272949	the
examination
having taken place
I might have
something
to write
Absurd
for
to me
it seems
[in] sending
a prisoner
not
272963	also
272965	the
272968	against
him
charges
to specify
Agrippa
then
272975	to
272977	-
Paul
was saying
It is permitted
you
272983	for
yourself
to speak
Then
272988	-
Paul
having stretched out
272992	the
hand
began his defense
272996	Concerning
272998	all
of which
I am accused
273002	by
[the] Jews
King
Agrippa
I esteem
myself
fortunate
273010	before
you
being about
today
to defend myself
Especially
273017	acquainted
being
you
273021	with all
273023	the
273026	of
[the] Jews
customs
and
also
controversies
therefore
I implore [you]
patiently
to hear
me
273038	The
indeed
then
273043	manner of life
of me
273046	from
youth
-
273050	from [its]
beginning
having been
273054	among
273056	the
273058	nation
of me
273061	in
also
Jerusalem
know
273066	all
Jews
knowing
me
from the first
if
they would be willing
to testify
that
273076	according to
273078	the
273080	strictest
273082	sect
273084	-
273086	of our
religion
I lived [as]
a Pharisee
And
now
273093	for [the]
273095	hope
273097	of the
273100	to
273102	the
273104	fathers
of us
promise
having been made
273109	by
273111	-
God
I stand
being judged
273116	to
which
273119	the
273121	twelve tribes
of us
273124	in
earnestness
night
and
day
serving
hope
to attain
273133	concerning
273135	which
hope
I am accused
273139	by
the Jews
O king
Why
incredible
is it judged
273146	by
you
if
273150	-
God
[the] dead
raises
I
indeed
therefore
thought
in myself
273160	to
273162	the
273164	name
of Jesus
273167	-
of Nazareth
I ought
273171	many things
contrary
to do
which
also
I did
273178	in
Jerusalem
and
273182	many
also
273185	of the
saints
I
273189	in
prisons
locked up
273193	the
273196	from
273198	the
chief priests
authority
having received
being put to death
then
they
I cast against [them]
a vote
And
273209	in
273211	all
273213	the
synagogues
often
punishing
them
I was compelling [them]
to blaspheme
Exceedingly
then
being furious
against them
I kept persecuting [them]
273226	as far as
273228	even
273230	to
273232	-
273234	foreign
cities
273237	during
which
journeying
273241	to
273243	-
Damascus
273246	with
[the] authority
and
commission
273251	of
273253	the
chief priests
273256	day
mid
273259	on
273261	the
road
I saw
O king
from heaven
273267	above
273269	the
273271	brightness
273273	of the
sun
having shone around
me
a light
and
those
273281	with
me
journeying
273285	All
and
having fallen down
of us
273290	to
273292	the
ground
I heard
a voice
saying
273298	to
me
273301	in the
Hebrew
language
Saul
Saul
why
Me
persecute you
[It is] hard
for you
273312	against
[the] goads
to kick
I
then
said
Who
are You
Lord
273322	-
And
the Lord
said
I
am
Jesus
whom
you
are persecuting
But
rise up
and
stand
273337	on
273339	the
273341	feet
of you
273344	for this
purpose
for
I have appeared
to you
to appoint
you
a servant
and
273354	a witness
of that which
both
you have seen
of Me
of the things in which
then
I will appear
to you
delivering
you
273366	out from
273368	the
people
and
273372	from
273374	the
Gentiles
273377	to
whom
I
am sending
you
to open
273384	eyes
of them
that
they may turn
273389	from
darkness
273392	to
light
and
273397	from the
273399	power
273401	-
of Satan
273404	to
273406	-
God
[that]
may receive
they
273412	forgiveness
of sins
and
273416	[an] inheritance
273418	among
those
having been sanctified
by faith
273423	that [is]
273425	in
Me
So then
O king
Agrippa
not
I was
disobedient
273434	to the
273436	heavenly
vision
but
273441	to those
273443	in
Damascus
first
both
and
Jerusalem
273450	all
and
273453	the
273455	region
273457	-
of Judea
and
273461	to the
Gentiles
I kept declaring
to repent
and
to turn
273468	to
273470	-
God
273474	worthy
273476	-
of repentance
works
doing
273481	On account of
these things
me
the Jews
having seized
273487	in
273489	the
temple
they were attempting
to kill
273494	Help
therefore
having obtained
273498	-
273500	from
273502	-
God
273505	unto
273508	the
day
this
I have stood
bearing witness
to small
both
and
to great
nothing
273519	other
saying
than what
both
273524	the
prophets
said
was about
to happen
and
Moses
that
would suffer
273534	the
Christ
as
first
273539	through
273541	resurrection
from [the] dead
light
He is about
to preach
273547	to
both
our people
and
273552	to the
Gentiles
These things
now
of him
saying in his defense
273559	-
Festus
273562	in a loud
273564	-
voice
said
You are insane
Paul
273570	The
273572	great
of you
learning
273576	to
insanity
turns [you]
273580	-
But
Paul
Not
I am insane
says
273587	most excellent
Festus
but
273591	of truth
and
sobriety
words
I utter
Understands
for
273599	concerning
these things
273602	the
king
273605	to
whom
also
using boldness
I speak
Are hidden from
for
him
of these things
not
I am persuaded
none
not
for
273620	is
273622	in
a corner
done
of these things
Believe you
King
Agrippa
273630	the
prophets
I know
that
you believe
273636	-
Then
Agrippa
273640	[said] to
273642	-
Paul
273645	Within
so little
me
do you persuade
a Christian
to become
273652	-
And
Paul [said]
I would wish
-
273658	-
to God
both
273662	in
a little
and
273666	in
much
273669	not
only
you
but
273674	also
273676	all
those
hearing
me
this day
to become
such
as
273685	also
I
am
273689	except
273692	the
chains
these
Rose up
then
273698	the
king
and
273702	the
governor
273705	-
and
Bernice
and
those
sitting with
them
and
having withdrawn
they began speaking
273716	to
one another
saying
-
273721	Nothing
273723	of death
or
of chains
worthy
is doing
273730	the
man
this
Agrippa
then
273736	to
Festus
was saying
Have been released
could
273743	the
man
this
if
not
he had appealed
to Caesar
When
now
was determined
-
sailing
our
273757	to
273759	-
Italy
they delivered
273763	-
both
Paul
and
273768	certain
273770	other
prisoners
273774	to a centurion
named
Julius
273778	of the cohort
of Augustus
Having boarded
then
273784	a ship
of Adramyttium
being about
to sail
273789	to
273791	the
273794	along
273796	-
Asia
places
we set sail
being
273802	with
us
Aristarchus
273806	a Macedonian
of Thessalonica
273809	The
then
next [day]
we landed
273814	at
Sidon
Considerately
then
273819	-
Julius
273822	-
Paul
having treated
allowed [him]
273827	to
273829	his
friends
having gone
care
to receive
And from there
having set sail
we sailed under
273838	-
Cyprus
273841	because of
-
273844	the
winds
being
contrary
273849	-
And
then
273853	-
273855	along
273857	-
Cilicia
and
Pamphylia
having sailed across [the sea]
we came
273864	to
273866	Myra
273868	-
of Lycia
And there
having found
273873	the
centurion
273877	a ship
of Alexandria
sailing
273881	to
273883	-
Italy
he placed
us
273888	into
it
273891	For
273893	many
now
days
sailing slowly
and
with difficulty
having arrived
273901	off
273903	-
Cnidus
not
permitting
us
273909	the
wind
we sailed under
273913	-
Crete
273916	off
Salmone
With difficulty
and
coasting along
it
we came
273924	to
273927	a place
certain
called
273931	Fair
Havens
273934	to which
near
was
[the] city
of Lasea
273940	Much
now
time
having passed
and
being
already
dangerous
273949	the
voyage
273952	because of
-
273955	even
273957	the
Fast
already
being over
was admonishing [them]
273963	-
Paul
saying
to them
Men
I understand
that
273971	with
273973	disaster
and
273976	much
loss
273979	not
only
273982	of the
cargo
and
273986	of the
ship
but
273990	also
273992	the
273994	lives
of us
is about
to be
273999	the
voyage
274002	-
But
the centurion
274006	by the
pilot
and
274010	the
ship owner
rather
was persuaded
than
by the things
274017	by
Paul
spoken
Unsuitable
now
274023	the
harbor
being
274027	to
winter in
274030	the
majority
reached
a decision
to set sail
from there
if
somehow
they might be able
having arrived
274041	at
Phoenix
to winter [there]
274046	a harbor
274048	-
of Crete
looking
274052	toward
[the] southwest
and
274056	toward
[the] northwest
Having blown gently
now
a south wind
having thought
274063	the
purpose
to have obtained
having weighed [anchor]
very near
they began coasting along
274070	-
Crete
274073	After
274075	not
long
however
there came
274080	down
from it
274083	a wind
tempestuous
-
called
the Northeaster
Having been caught
then
274091	the
ship
and
not
being able
to face
274098	to the
wind
having given way
we were driven along
274104	An Island
then
certain
having run under
called
Cauda
we were able
with difficulty
control
to gain
274115	of the
lifeboat
which
having taken up
supports
they began using
undergirding
274123	the
ship
Fearing
then
lest
274129	into
274131	the
sandbars of Syrtis
they should fall
having lowered
274136	the
gear
thus
they were driven along
Violently
now
being storm-tossed
of us
274145	on the
next [day]
a jettison of cargo
they began to make
and
274151	on the
third [day]
with [their] own hands
274155	the
274157	tackle
274159	of the
ship
they cast away
Neither
now
sun
nor
stars
appearing
274169	for
274171	many
days
274174	tempest
and
274177	no
small
lying on [us]
from then on
was abandoned
274184	hope
all
-
being saved
of us
274190	Much
also
time without food
there being
at that time
having stood up
274197	-
Paul
274200	in
274202	midst
of them
he said
It behooved [you]
indeed
274208	O
men
having been obedient
to me
not
to have set sail
274215	from
274217	-
Crete
to have incurred
then
274223	the
disaster
this
and
274228	-
loss
And yet
274232	-
now
I exhort
you
to keep up your courage
274238	loss
for
of life
none
there will be
274244	from among
you
274247	only
274249	of the
ship
Stood by
for
me
274255	this
274257	-
night
274261	-
of God
whose
am
whom
and
I serve
an angel
saying
Not
fear
Paul
Caesar
you
it behooves
to stand before
And
behold
has granted
to you
274282	-
God
274285	all
those
sailing
274289	with
you
Therefore
take courage
men
I believe
for
274297	-
God
that
thus
it will be
274303	according to
274305	the
way
it has been said
to me
274310	Upon
274312	an island
however
certain
it behooves
us
to fall
When
then
274321	the fourteenth
night
had come
being driven about
of us
274327	in
274329	the
Adriatic
274332	toward
274334	[the] middle
274336	of the
night
began sensing
274340	the
sailors
to be drawing near
274344	some
to them
land
And
having taken soundings
they found
274351	fathoms
twenty
A little
then
having gone farther
and
again
having taken soundings
they found
274361	fathoms
fifteen
Fearing
then
lest
somewhere
274368	on
274370	rocky
places
we might fall
274374	out of [the]
stern
having cast
274378	anchors
four
they were praying for
day
to come
274384	Of the
then
sailors
seeking
to flee
274390	out of
274392	the
ship
and
having let down
274397	the
lifeboat
274400	into
274402	the
sea
under pretense
as
274407	from
[the] bow
anchors
being about
to cast out
said
274414	-
Paul
274417	to the
centurion
and
274421	to the
soldiers
If
not
these
remain
274428	in
274430	the
ship
you
to be saved
not
are able
Then
cut away
274439	the
soldiers
274442	the
274444	ropes
274446	of the
lifeboat
and
allowed
her
to fall away
274453	Until
then
that
day
was about
to come
kept urging
274461	-
Paul
all
to partake
of food
saying
274468	The fourteenth
today
[is] day
watching
without eating
you continue
nothing
having taken
Therefore
I exhort
you
to take
food
this
indeed
274484	for
274486	-
274488	of you
preservation
is
274493	not one
for
of you
a hair
274498	of
274500	the
head
will perish
Having said
now
these things
and
having taken
bread
he gave thanks
274511	-
to God
274514	before
all
and
having broken [it]
he began
to eat
Encouraged
then
having been
all
274525	also
themselves
took
food
We were
then
274532	the
274534	altogether
274536	souls
274538	in
274540	the
ship
two hundred
seventy
six
Having been filled
then
with food
they began to lighten
274550	the
ship
casting out
274554	the
wheat
274557	into
274559	the
sea
When
now
day
it was
274566	the
land
not
they did recognize
274572	a bay
however
certain
they noticed
having
a shore
274579	on
which
they determined
if
they should be able
to drive
274586	the
ship
And
274590	the
anchors
having cut away
they left [them]
274595	in
274597	the
sea
at the same time
having loosened
274602	the
274604	ropes
274606	of the
rudders
And
having hoisted
274611	the
foresail
to the
blowing [wind]
they began making
274617	for
274619	the
shore
Having fallen
however
274624	into
274626	a place
between two seas
they ran aground
274630	the
vessel
and
274634	the
indeed
bow
having stuck fast
it remained
immovable
274641	-
and
the stern
was being broken up
274646	by
274648	the
violence
274652	Of the
now
soldiers
[the] plan
was
that
274659	the
prisoners
they should kill
lest
anyone
having swum away
should escape
274667	-
But
the centurion
desiring
to save
274673	-
Paul
hindered
them
274678	of
[the] purpose
he commanded
then
those
being able
to swim
having cast [themselves] off
first
274688	on
274690	the
land
to go out
and
274695	the
rest
some
indeed
274700	on
boards
some
then
274705	on
274707	things
274709	-
274711	from
274713	the
ship
And
thus
it came to pass that
all
were brought safely
274721	to
274723	the
land
And
having been saved
then
we found out
that
Malta
274732	the
island
is called
274736	-
And
the natives
were showing
274742	not [just]
the
ordinary
kindness
to us
Having kindled
for
a fire
they received
274752	all
of us
274755	because of
274757	the
rain
-
coming on
and
274763	because
274765	of the
cold
Having gathered
now
274770	-
Paul
274773	of sticks
274775	a
quantity
and
having laid [them]
274780	on
274782	the
fire
a viper
274786	out from
274788	the
heat
having come
fastened
274793	on the
274795	hand
of him
When
then
saw
274801	the
natives
hanging
274805	the
beast
274808	from
274810	the
274812	hand
of him
274815	to
one another
they began to say
By all means
a murderer
is
274823	the
man
this
whom
having been saved
274829	from
274831	the
sea
274834	-
Justice
to live
not
has permitted
The [one]
indeed
then
having shaken off
274844	the
creature
274847	into
274849	the
fire
he suffered
274853	no
injury
-
But
they were expecting
him
to be about
to become inflamed
or
to fall down
suddenly
dead
274866	A while
great
however
of them
waiting
and
seeing
274874	nothing
amiss
274877	to
him
happening
having changed their opinion
they began declaring
him
to be
a god
274886	In
now
274889	the [parts]
274891	around
274894	the
place
that
were
lands
274901	belonging to the
274903	chief
274905	of the
island
named
Publius
who
having received
us
274913	days
three
hospitably
entertained [us]
It came to pass
then
274920	the
274922	father
274924	-
of Publius
fevers
and
dysentery
oppressed with
was lying
274932	toward
whom
274935	-
Paul
having entered
and
having prayed
having laid
274942	the
hands
on him
healed
him
Of this
then
having taken place
274951	also
274953	the
rest
-
274957	in
274959	the
island
having
infirmities
were coming
and
were healed
who
also
274969	with many
honors
honored
us
and
on setting sail
they laid on [us]
274977	the things
274979	for
274981	the
needs
274984	After
then
274987	three
months
we sailed
274991	in
274995	a ship
having wintered
274998	in
275000	the
island
Alexandrian
with a figurehead of
the Dioscuri
And
having put in
275008	at
Syracuse
we stayed
275012	days
three
from where
having gone around
we arrived
275018	at
Rhegium
And
275022	after
275024	one
day
having come on
a south wind
on the second day
we came
275031	to
Puteoli
where
having found
[some] brothers
we were entreated
275038	with
them
to remain
275042	days
seven
And
so
275047	to
275049	-
Rome
we came
And from there
275054	the
brothers
having heard
275058	the things
275060	concerning
us
came out
275064	to
275066	meet
us
275069	as far as
275071	of Appius
[the] market
and
275075	[the] Three
Taverns
whom
having seen
275080	-
Paul
having given thanks
275084	to
God
took
courage
When
now
we came
275092	to
Rome
was allowed
275096	-
Paul
to stay
275100	by
himself
275103	with
275105	the
275107	guarding
him
soldier
It came to pass
then
275113	after
275115	days
three
called together
he
those
being
275123	of the
Jews
leaders
Having come together
then
of them
he was saying
275131	to
them
I
men
brothers
275137	nothing
against
having done
275141	the
people
or
275145	the
275147	customs
275149	-
of our fathers
a prisoner
275153	from
Jerusalem
was delivered
275157	into
275159	the
275161	hands
275163	of the
Romans
who
having examined
me
were wanting
to let [me] go
275171	on account of
-
275174	not one
275176	cause
of death
existing
275180	in
me
Objecting
however
275185	of the
Jews
I was compelled
to appeal to
Caesar
not
as
275193	the
275195	nation
of me
having
anything
to lay against
275201	For
275203	this
therefore
275206	-
cause
I have called
you
to see
and
to speak to [you]
275214	because of
for
275217	the
275219	hope
275221	-
of Israel
275225	the
chain
this
I have around [me]
-
And
275232	to
him
they said
We
neither
275238	letters
275240	concerning
you
received
275244	from
275246	-
Judea
nor
having arrived
275251	any
275253	of the
brothers
reported
or
said
275260	anything
275262	concerning
you
evil
We deem it worthy
however
275268	from
you
to hear
what
you think
275274	concerning
truly
for
275279	the
sect
this
known
to us
it is
that
everywhere
it is spoken against
Having appointed
then
him
a day
came
275294	to
him
275297	to
275299	the
lodging
many
to whom
he expounded
fully testifying
275306	to the
275308	kingdom
275310	-
of God
persuading
then
them
275316	concerning
275318	-
Jesus
275321	from
both
275324	the
275326	law
of Moses
and
275330	the
Prophets
275333	from
morning
275336	to
evening
And
some
indeed
were persuaded of
the things
he is speaking
some
however
refused to believe
Discordant
then
being
275351	with
one another
they began to leave
having spoken
275356	-
Paul
275359	word
one
-
Rightly
275364	the
275366	Spirit
275368	-
Holy
spoke
275372	by
Isaiah
275375	the
prophet
275378	to
275380	the
275382	fathers
of you
saying
Go
275387	to
275390	the
people
this
and
say
In hearing
you will hear
and
275399	no
not
understand
and
in seeing
you will see
and
275407	no
not
perceive
Has grown dull
for
275413	the
275415	heart
275418	of the
people
this
and
275423	with the
ears
barely
they hear
and
275429	the
275431	eyes
of them
they have closed
lest
ever
they should see
275438	with the
eyes
and
275442	with the
ears
they should hear
and
275447	with the
heart
they should understand
and
should turn
and
I will heal
them
Known
therefore
be it
to you
that
275461	to the
Gentiles
has been sent
275465	this
275467	-
275469	salvation
275471	-
of God
they
then
will listen
He stayed
then
275479	two years
whole
275482	in
275484	his own
rented house
and
was welcoming
275489	all
-
coming
275493	unto
him
proclaiming
275497	the
275499	kingdom
275501	-
of God
and
teaching
275506	the things
275508	concerning
275510	the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
275515	with
275517	all
boldness
unhinderedly
275521	Paul
275523	a servant
of Christ
Jesus
275527	a called
apostle
having been set apart
275531	for
275533	[the] gospel
of God
which
He promised beforehand
275538	through
275540	the
275542	prophets
of Him
275545	in
275547	[the] Scriptures
Holy
275550	concerning
275553	the
275555	Son
of Him
-
having come
275560	of [the]
275562	seed
of David
275565	according to
flesh
-
having been declared
275570	Son
of God
275573	in
power
275576	according to [the]
275578	Spirit
of holiness
275581	by
275583	resurrection
[from the] dead
Jesus
Christ
275588	the
275590	Lord
of us
275593	through
whom
we have received
grace
and
apostleship
275600	unto
275602	obedience
of faith
275605	among
275607	all
275609	the
Gentiles
275612	on behalf of
275614	the
275616	name
of Him
275619	among
whom
are
275623	also
you
275626	called
of Jesus
Christ
275630	To all
those
being
275634	in
Rome
275637	beloved
of God
275640	called
saints
Grace
to you
and
peace
275647	from
God
275650	[the] Father
of us
and
[the] Lord
Jesus
Christ
First
indeed
I thank
275660	the
275662	God
of me
275665	through
Jesus
Christ
275669	for
275671	all
of you
because
275675	the
275677	faith
of you
is being proclaimed
275681	in
275683	all
275685	the
world
275688	Witness
for
my
is
275693	-
God
whom
I serve
275698	in
275700	the
275702	spirit
of me
275705	in
275707	the
275709	gospel
275711	of the
275713	Son
of Him
how
unceasingly
275718	mention
of you
I make
always
275723	upon
275725	the
275727	prayers
of me
imploring
if
perhaps
275733	now
at last
I will make a prosperous journey
275737	by
275739	the
275741	will
275743	-
of God
to come
275747	to
you
I long
for
to see
you
that
275755	some
I may impart
275758	gift
to you
spiritual
275762	to
the
strengthening
of you
that
now
is
to be encouraged together
275771	among
you
275774	through
275776	the
275779	among
one another
275782	faith
of you
both
and
of me
Not
I do want
now
you
to be ignorant
brothers
that
many times
I purposed
to come
275798	to
you
and
was hindered
275803	until
275805	the
present
that
275809	some
fruit
I might have
275813	also
275815	among
you
as
275819	even
275821	among
275823	the
275825	other
Gentiles
To Greeks
both
and
to barbarians
to [the] wise
both
and
[the] foolish
a debtor
I am
Thus
275839	-
275842	as to
me [there is]
readiness
275846	also
to you
275849	who [are]
275851	in
Rome
to preach the gospel
Not
for
I am ashamed of
275858	the
gospel
275861	[the] power
for
of God
it is
275866	unto
salvation
275869	to everyone
-
believing
275873	to Jewish
both
first
and
to Greek
275879	[The] righteousness
for
of God
275883	in
it
is revealed
275887	from
faith
275890	to
faith
as
it has been written
275895	-
And
the righteous
275899	by
faith
will live
Is revealed
for
275905	[the] wrath
of God
275908	from
heaven
275911	upon
275913	all
275915	ungodliness
and
unrighteousness
of men
-
275921	the
truth
275924	by
unrighteousness
suppressing
because
275929	the
275931	known
275933	-
of God
manifest
is
275938	among
them
275941	-
God
for
to them
has revealed [it]
275947	The
for
275950	invisible qualities
of Him
275953	from
275955	[the] creation
of [the] world
275958	by the
things made
being understood
are clearly seen
275963	the
both
275966	eternal
275968	of Him
power
and
divinity
275973	for
-
to be
them
without excuse
For
having known
275981	-
God
not
275985	as
God
they glorified [Him]
or
were thankful
but
they became futile
275993	in
275995	the
275997	thinking
of them
and
was darkened
276002	the
276004	foolish
276006	of them
heart
Professing
to be
wise
they became fools
and
they changed
276015	the
276017	glory
276019	of the
276021	immortal
God
276024	into
276026	a likeness
276028	of an image
276030	of mortal
man
and
birds
and
quadrupeds
and
creeping things
Therefore
gave up
them
276042	-
God
276045	in
276047	the
276049	desires
276051	of the
276053	hearts
of them
276056	to
impurity
-
to dishonor
276061	the
276063	bodies
of them
276066	between
themselves
who
changed
276071	the
276073	truth
276075	-
of God
276078	into
276080	the
falsehood
and
reverenced
and
served
276087	the
created thing
276090	beyond
the [One]
having created [it]
who
is
blessed
276097	to
276099	the
ages
Amen
276103	Because of
this
gave up
them
276108	-
God
276111	to
276113	passions
of dishonor
276116	-
Even
for
276120	females
of them
changed
276124	the
276126	natural
use
276129	into
276131	that
276133	contrary to
nature
Likewise
then
276138	also
276140	the
males
having left
276144	the
276146	natural
276148	use
276150	of the
female
were inflamed
276154	in
276156	the
276158	desire
of them
276161	toward
one another
males
276165	with
males
276168	the
shame
working out
and
276173	the
276175	recompense
which
was fitting
276179	of the
276181	error
of them
276184	in
themselves
receiving
And
as
not
they did see fit
276192	-
God
to have
276196	in [their]
knowledge
gave up
them
276201	-
God
276204	to
276206	a depraved
mind
to do
things
not
being proper
being filled with
276214	all
unrighteousness
wickedness
covetousness
malice
full
of envy
murder
strife
deceit
maliciousness
gossips
slanderers
hateful to God
insolent

affirm

then
Are we better
Not
at all
We have already charged
for
277058	Jews
both

all
277064	under

As
it has been written

there is
277160	fear
of God
277163	before
277165	the
277167	eyes

We know
now
that
whatever
277174	the
law
says
277178	to those
277180	under
277182	the
law
it speaks
so that
277187	every

may be stopped
and
under judgment
may be
277194	all
277196	the
world

to God
Therefore
277203	by
277205	works
of [the] Law
not
will be justified
277210	any
flesh
277213	before
Him

Now
however
277225	apart from

277228	[the] righteousness
of God
has been revealed
being borne witness to
277233	by
277235	the

and
277239	the

277243	[the] righteousness

there is

for
have sinned

fall short
277268	of the

freely
277277	by the

277282	through
277284	the
redemption
277287	that
277289	[is] in

Jesus
whom
set forth as
277295	-
God
a propitiation
277299	through
faith
277302	in
277304	-
277306	His
blood
277309	for
277311	a showing forth
277313	of the
277315	righteousness
of Him
277318	because of
277320	the
277322	forbearance
277324	of the
277326	having taken place beforehand
sins
277329	in
277331	the
277333	forbearance
277335	-
of God

to be
Him
just
and
justifying
277364	the [one]
277366	of

Where
then [is]
277373	the
boasting
It has been excluded
277377	Through
277379	what
principle
277382	That
of works
No
but
277387	through
277389	[the] principle
of faith
We reckon
therefore
to be justified
by faith
a man
277397	apart from
277399	works
of the Law
Or
of Jews
277404	[is He] the
God
only
not
277409	also
of Gentiles
Yes
277413	also
of Gentiles
since indeed
One
277418	-
God [is]
who
will justify
[the] circumcision
277424	by
faith
and
[the] uncircumcision
277429	through
277431	the [same]
faith

then
do we nullify
277437	through
277439	-
faith
Never
may it be
Instead
law
we uphold
What
then
shall we say
discovered
Abraham
277452	the
277454	father
of us
277457	according to
[the] flesh
If
for
Abraham
277463	by
works
was justified
he has
ground of boasting
but
not
277471	toward
God
What
for
277476	the
Scripture
says
Believed
then
Abraham
277483	-
God
and
it was reckoned
to him
277489	for
righteousness
To the [one]
now
working
277495	the
reward
not
is reckoned
277500	according to
grace
but
277504	according to
debt
To the [one]
however
not
working
believing
however
277513	on
the [One]
justifying
277517	the
ungodly
is reckoned
277521	the
277523	faith
of him
277526	for
righteousness
just as
277530	also
David
declares
277534	the
277536	blessedness
277538	of the
man
to whom
277542	-
God
credits
righteousness
277547	apart from

277551	[are they] of whom
are forgiven
277554	the
lawless deeds
and
277558	of whom
are covered
277561	the

[the] man
against whom
277567	no
not
will reckon
[the] Lord
sin
277574	[Is] the
blessing
then
this
277579	on
277581	the
circumcision
or
277585	also
277587	on
277589	the
uncircumcision
We are saying
for
was credited
277595	-
to Abraham
277598	the
faith
277601	as
righteousness
How
then
was it credited
277607	In
circumcision
being
or
277612	in
uncircumcision
Not
277616	in
circumcision

277620	in
uncircumcision
And
277624	[the] sign
he received
of circumcision
277628	a seal
277630	of the
277632	righteousness
277634	of the

to be credited

277663	the

not

wrath
brings
where
now
no
there is
law
neither [is]
transgression
277758	Therefore
it [is]
277761	of
faith
that [it may be]
277765	according to
grace
277768	for
-
to be
sure
277773	the
promise
277776	to all
277778	the
seed
not
277782	to that
277784	of
277787	the
law
only
but
277792	also
277794	to that
277796	of [the]
277798	faith
of Abraham
who
is
277803	[the] father
277805	of all
of us
as
it has been written
-
277811	A father
277813	of many
nations
I have made
you
277818	before
whom
he believed
God
the [One]
giving life
277825	to the
dead
and
calling
the things
not
[into] being
277833	even
existing
who
277837	against
hope
277840	in
hope
believed
277844	for
-
to become
him
277849	[the] father
277851	of many
nations
277854	according to
that
having been spoken
So
shall be
277860	the
277862	offspring
of you
And
not
having become weak
277868	in the
faith
he considered
277872	-
277874	of himself
the body
having become dead
a hundred years old
about
being
and
277882	the
277884	lifelessness
277886	of the
277888	womb
of Sarah
277891	At
however
277894	the
277896	promise
277898	-
of God
not
he did waver
277903	-
through unbelief
but
was strengthened
277908	-
in faith
having given
glory
277913	-
to God
and
having been fully assured
that
what
He had promised
able
He is
also
to do
Therefore
also
it was credited
to him
277929	unto
righteousness
Not
it was written
now
277935	on account of
him
alone
that
it was credited
to him
but
277943	also
277945	on account of
us
to whom
it is about
to be credited
to those
believing
277953	on
the [One]
having raised
Jesus
277958	the
277960	Lord
of us
277963	out from
[the] dead
who
was delivered over
277968	for
277970	the
277972	trespasses
of us
and
was raised
277977	for
277979	the
277981	justification
of us
Having been justified
therefore
277986	by
faith
peace
we have
277991	with
277993	-
God
277996	through
277998	the
278000	Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
278005	through
whom
278008	also
278010	-
access
we have
278014	by the
faith
278017	into
278020	the
grace
this
278024	in
which
we stand
and
we boast
278030	in
278032	hope
278034	of the
278036	glory
278038	-
of God
Not
only [so]
now
but
also
we glory
278047	in
278049	-
tribulations
knowing
that
278054	-
tribulation
perseverance
produces
278059	-
And
perseverance
character
278064	-
and
character
hope
278069	-
And
hope
not
does make [us] ashamed
because
278076	the
278078	love
278080	-
of God
has been poured out
278084	into
278086	the
278088	hearts
of us
278091	through
278093	[the] Spirit
Holy
the [One]
having been given
to us
Yet
indeed
Christ
being
of us
without strength
still
278106	according to
[the] right time
278109	for
[the] ungodly
died
Rarely
indeed
278115	for
a righteous [man]
anyone
will die
278120	on behalf of
though
278123	the
good [man]
perhaps
someone
even
would dare
to die
Demonstrates
however
278133	the
278135	of Himself
love
278138	to
us
278141	-
God
that
still
sinners
being
of us
Christ
278150	for
us
died
278154	Much
therefore
more
having been justified
now
278160	by
278162	the
278164	blood
of Him
we will be saved
278168	by
Him
278171	from
278173	the
wrath
If
for
enemies
being
we were reconciled
278181	-
to God
278184	through
278186	the
278188	death
278190	of the
278192	Son
of Him
278195	much
more
having been reconciled
shall we be saved
278200	in
278202	the
278204	life
of Him
Not
only [so]
now
but
also
we are rejoicing
278213	in
278215	-
God
278218	through
278220	the
278222	Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
278227	through
whom
now
278231	the
reconciliation
we have received
278235	Because of
this
just as
278239	through
278241	one
man
278244	-
sin
278247	into
278249	the
world
entered
and
278254	through
278256	-
sin
278259	-
death
278262	also
thus
278265	to
278267	all
men
278270	-
death
passed
278274	for
that
all
sinned
278279	Until
for
[the] law
sin
was
278285	in [the]
world
sin
however
not
is imputed
not
there being
law
Nevertheless
reigned
278297	-
death
278300	from
Adam
278303	until
Moses
278306	even
278308	over
those
not
having sinned
278313	in
278315	the
278317	likeness
278319	of the
278321	transgression
of Adam
who
is
278326	a type
of the
coming [One]
But
[is] not
like
278333	the
trespass
so
278337	also
278339	the
gift
If
for
278344	by the
278347	of the
one
trespass
278351	the
many
died
278355	how much
more
278358	the
278360	grace
278362	-
of God
and
278366	the
278368	gift
278370	in
grace
278373	which [is]
278375	of the
278377	one
man
Jesus
Christ
278382	to
278384	the
many
did abound
And
[is] not
278390	as
278392	through
278394	one
having sinned
278397	the
gift
278400	The
truly
for
judgment [was]
278405	of
one
278408	[was] unto
condemnation
278411	-
but
the gift
278415	[is] out of
278417	many
trespasses
278420	unto
justification
If
for
278425	by the
278428	of the
one
trespass
278432	-
death
reigned
278436	through
278438	the
one
278441	how much
more
those
278445	the
278447	abundance
278449	-
of grace
and
278453	of the
278455	gift
278457	-
of righteousness
receiving
278461	in
life
will reign
278465	through
278467	the
one
Jesus
Christ
So
then
just as
278475	by
278477	one
trespass
278480	to
278482	all
men
278485	[it is] unto
condemnation
so
278489	also
278491	by
278493	one
act of righteousness
278496	to
278498	all
men
278501	[it is] unto
278503	justification
of life
For as
for
278508	through
278510	the
278512	disobedience
278514	of the
278516	one
man
sinners
were made
278521	the
many
so
278525	also
278527	through
278529	the
278531	obedience
278533	of the
One
righteous
will be made
278538	the
many
[The] law
now
entered
so that
might abound
278546	the
trespass
where
however
abounded
278552	-
sin
overabounded
278556	-
grace
so that
just as
reigned
278562	the
sin
278565	in
278567	-
death
so
278571	also
278573	-
grace
might reign
278577	through
righteousness
278580	unto
278582	life
eternal
278585	through
Jesus
Christ
278589	the
278591	Lord
of us
What
then
will we say
Shall we continue
278598	-
in sin
that
278602	-
grace
may abound
Never
may it be
Who
we died
278610	-
to sin
how
still
shall we live
278616	in
it
Or
are you unaware
that
as many as
have been baptized
278624	into
Christ
Jesus
278628	into
278630	the
278632	death
of Him
have been baptized
We were buried
therefore
with Him
278639	through
278641	-
baptism
278644	into
278646	-
death
so that
just as
was raised up
Christ
278653	out from
[the] dead
278656	by
278658	the
278660	glory
278662	of the
Father
so
278666	also
we
278669	in
278671	newness
of life
should walk
If
for
united
we have become
278679	in the
278681	likeness
278683	of the
278685	death
of Him
certainly
278689	also
278691	of the
resurrection
we will be
this
knowing
that
278698	-
278700	old
278702	of us
self
was crucified with [Him]
so that
might be annulled
278708	the
278710	body
278712	-
of sin
[that]
no longer
are enslaved
we
278719	-
to sin
The [one]
for
having died
has been freed
278726	from
278728	-
sin
If
now
we died
278734	with
Christ
we believe
that
also
we will live with
Him
knowing
that
Christ
having been raised up
278746	out from
[the] dead
no more
dies
Death
Him
no longer
rules over
That which
for
He died
278758	-
to sin
He died
once for all
that which
however
He lives
He lives
278767	-
to God
So
278771	also
you
consider
yourselves
to be
dead
indeed
278779	-
to sin
living
however
278784	-
to God
278787	in
Christ
Jesus
Not
therefore
let reign
278794	-
sin
278797	in
278799	the
278801	mortal
278803	of you
body
278806	in order
-
to obey
278810	the
278812	desires
of it
Neither
yield
278817	the
278819	members
of you
278822	[as] instruments
of unrighteousness
278825	-
to sin
but
yield
yourselves
278831	-
to God
278834	as
278836	out from
[the] dead
living
and
278841	the
278843	members
of you
278846	[as] instruments
of righteousness
278849	-
to God
Sin
for
you
not
will rule over
not
for
you are
278860	under
law
but
278864	under
grace
What
then
Shall we sin
because
not
we are
278873	under
law
but
278877	under
grace
Never
may it be
Not
know you
that
to whom
you yield
yourselves
[as] slaves
278889	for
obedience
slaves
you are
to him whom
you obey
whether
of sin
278898	to
death
or
of obedience
278903	to
righteousness
Thanks [be]
however
278908	-
to God
that
you used to be
278913	slaves
278915	-
of sin
you have become obedient
now
278920	from [the]
heart
278923	to
which
you were handed over
278927	to the form
of teaching
Having been set free
now
278932	from
278934	-
sin
you have become slaves
278938	-
to righteousness
In human terms
I speak
278943	on account of
278945	the
278947	weakness
278949	of the
278951	flesh
of you
For as
for
you yielded
278957	the
278959	members
of you
in bondage
278963	-
to impurity
and
278967	to
lawlessness
278970	unto
278972	-
lawlessness
so
now
yield
278978	the
278980	members
of you
in bondage
278984	-
to righteousness
278987	unto
sanctification
When
for
278992	slaves
you were
278995	-
of sin
free
you were
279000	-
from righteousness
279003	What
therefore
fruit
had you
then
279009	in the [things]
of which
now
you are ashamed
279014	The
for
279017	end
of those things
[is] death
Now
however
having been set free
279024	from
279026	-
sin
having become slaves
now
279031	-
to God
you have
279035	the
279037	fruit
of you
279040	unto
sanctification
279043	-
now
the end
279047	[is] life
eternal
279050	The
for
279053	wages
279055	-
of sin
[is] death
279059	-
but
279062	the gift
279064	-
of God
279067	life
eternal
279070	in
Christ
Jesus
279074	the
279076	Lord
of us
Or
are you ignorant
brothers
to those knowing
for
law
I speak
that
279087	the
law
rules over
279091	the
man
279094	for
as long as
[the] time
he is alive
279099	The
for
279102	married
woman
279105	to the
279107	living
husband
is bound
by law
if
however
should die
279115	the
husband
she is cleared
279119	from
279122	the
law
279125	of the
husband
Then
therefore
being alive
279131	the
husband
an adulteress
she will be called
if
she is
279138	to man
another
if
however
should die
279144	the
husband
free
she is
279149	from
279151	the
law
[so as for]
not
to be
her
an adulteress
having been
279160	to man
another
Likewise
279164	brothers
of me
279167	also
you
have been put to death
279171	to the
law
279174	through
279176	the
279178	body
279180	-
of Christ
279183	for
-
to belong
you
to another
to the [One]
279190	out from
[the] dead
having been raised
so that
we should bear fruit
279196	-
to God
While
for
we were
279202	in
279204	the
flesh
279207	the
279209	passions
279211	-
of sins
279214	that [were]
279216	through
279218	the
law
were at work
279222	in
279224	the
279226	members
of us
279229	to
the
bringing forth of fruit
279233	-
to death
Now
however
we have been released
279239	from
279241	the
law
having died
279245	to
that which
we were bound
in order for
to serve
us
279252	in
279254	newness
of [the] Spirit
and
279258	not
279260	in oldness
of [the] letter
What
then
shall we say
279266	[Is] the
law
sin
Never
may it be
But
279273	-
sin
not
I have known
if
not
279280	by
law
279283	-
then
for
covetousness
not
I had been conscious of
if
not
279292	the
law
had said
Not
you shall covet
An occasion
however
having taken
279301	-
sin
279304	by
279306	the
commandment
it produced
279310	in
me
279313	all
covetousness
279316	apart from
for
[the] Law
sin
[is] dead
I
however
was alive
279325	apart from
law
once
having come
however
279331	the
commandment
279334	the
sin
revived
I
then
died
And
proved to be
me
279345	the
commandment
279348	that [was]
279350	to
life
this
279354	to
death
279357	The
for
sin
an occasion
having taken
279363	by
279365	the
commandment
deceived
me
and
279371	by
it
put [me] to death
So
279376	-
indeed
the law [is]
holy
and
279382	the
commandment [is]
holy
and
righteous
and
good
279390	That which
then
[is] good
to me
has become
death
Never
may it be
But
279400	-
sin
in order that
it might be shown to be
sin
279406	through
279408	that which [is]
good
to me
is working out
death
so that
might become
279416	beyond
excess
sinful
279420	-
sin
279423	through
279425	the
commandment
We know
for
that
279431	-
[the] Law
spiritual
is
I
however
fleshly
am
having been sold
279441	under
279443	-
sin
What
for
I do
not
I understand
not
for
what
I want
this
I do
but
what
I hate
this
I do
If
now
that which
not
I do want
this
I do
I consent
279470	to the
law
that [it is]
good
In that case
now
no longer
I
am doing
it
but
279482	the
279484	dwelling
279486	in
me
sin
I know
for
that
nothing
there dwells
279495	in
me
that
is
279500	in
279502	the
279504	flesh
of me
good
-
for
to will
is present with
me
-
but
to do
279516	the
good
not
Not
for
that
I desire
I do
good
but
that
not
I do want
evil
this
I practice
If
now
what
not
I do want
I
this
do
[it is] no longer
I
who do
it
but
279546	-
279548	dwelling
279550	in
me

I find
so
279556	the
principle
that

to do
279563	-

that
me
279568	-

is present with
I delight
for
279574	in the
279576	law
279578	-
of God
279581	according to
279583	the
279585	inward
man
I see
however
279590	another
law
279593	in
279595	the
279597	members
of me
warring against
279601	the
279603	law
279605	of the
279607	mind
of me
and
making captive
me
279613	to
279615	the
279617	law
279619	-
of sin
-
being
279624	in
279626	the
279628	members
of me
279631	O wretched
I am
man
Who
me
will deliver
279638	out of
279641	the
279643	body
279645	-
of death
this
Thanks [be]
279650	to
God
279653	through
Jesus
Christ
279657	the
279659	Lord
of us
Then
so
279664	myself
I
279667	with the
indeed
mind
serve
279672	law
Godâs
279675	-
but [with]
the flesh
279679	[the] law
of sin
279682	[There is] no
therefore
now
condemnation
279687	to those
279689	in
Christ
Jesus
279693	-
For
279696	the law
279698	of the
279700	Spirit
279702	of
life
279705	in
Christ
Jesus
has set free
you
279711	from
279713	the
279715	law
279717	-
of sin
and
279721	-
of death
279724	-
For
279727	powerless [being]
279729	the
law
279732	in
that
it was weak
279736	through
279738	the
flesh
279741	-
God
279744	-
279746	of Himself
Son
having sent
279750	in
279752	likeness
279754	of flesh
of sin
and
279758	for
sin
condemned
279762	-
sin
279765	in
279767	the
flesh
so that
279771	the
279773	righteousness
279775	of the
law
should be fulfilled
279779	in
us
-
not
279784	according to
the flesh
walking
but
279789	according to
[the] Spirit
Those
for
279794	according to
flesh
being
279798	the things
279800	of the
flesh
mind
those
however
279806	according to
Spirit
279809	the things
279811	of the
Spirit
279814	The
for
279817	mind
279819	of the
flesh
[is] death
279823	the
but
279826	mind
279828	of the
Spirit
life
and
peace
because
279835	the
279837	mind
279839	of the
flesh
[is] hostility
279843	toward
God
279846	to
for
279849	[the] law
279851	-
of God
not
it is subject
nor even
for
can it [be]
Those
now
279861	in
flesh
being
God
to please
not
are able
You
now
not
are
279873	in
flesh
but
279877	in
Spirit
if indeed [the]
279881	Spirit
of God
dwells
279885	in
you
if
however
anyone
279891	[the] Spirit
of Christ
not
has
he
not
is
of Him
If
however
Christ
279903	[is] in
you
279906	the
indeed
body [is]
dead
279911	on account of
sin
279914	the
however
Spirit
[is] life
279919	on account of
righteousness
If
now
279924	the
279926	Spirit
of the [One]
having raised up
279930	-
Jesus
279933	out from
[the] dead
dwells
279937	in
you
the [One]
having raised up
279942	out from
[the] dead
Christ
Jesus
will give life
279948	also
279950	to the
279952	mortal
279954	bodies
of you
279957	on account of
279959	-
279961	dwelling
279963	His
Spirit
279966	in
you
So
then
brothers
debtors
we are
not
279975	to the
flesh
-
279979	according to
flesh
to live
If
for
279985	according to
flesh
you live
you are about
to die
if
however
by [the] Spirit
279994	the
279996	deeds
279998	of the
body
you put to death
you will live
As many as
for
280005	by [the] Spirit
of God
are led
these
280010	sons
are
of God
Not
for
you have received
280017	a spirit
of bondage
again
280021	to
fear
but
you have received
280026	[the] Spirit
of divine adoption as sons
280029	by
whom
we cry
Abba
280034	-
Father
280037	Himself
280039	the
Spirit
bears witness with
280043	the
280045	spirit
of us
that
we are
280050	children
of God
If
now
children
280056	also
heirs
280059	heirs
indeed
of God
280063	joint-heirs
now
of Christ
if indeed
we suffer with [Him]
so that
also
we may be glorified together
I reckon
for
that
not
comparable
280077	the
280079	sufferings
280081	of the
280083	present
time [are]
280086	to
280088	the
280090	coming
glory
to be revealed
280094	to
us
280097	The
for
280100	earnest expectation
280102	of the
creation
280105	the
280107	revelation
280109	of the
280111	sons
280113	-
of God
awaits
280117	To the
for
futility
280121	the
creation
was subjected
not
willingly
but
280128	because of
the [One]
having subjected [it]
280132	in
hope
that
280136	also
280138	itself
280140	the
creation
will be set free
280144	from
280146	the
280148	bondage
280150	-
of decay
280153	into
280155	the
280157	freedom
280159	of the
280161	glory
280163	of the
280165	children
280167	-
of God
We know
for
that
280173	all
280175	the
creation
groans together
and
travails together
280181	until
280183	-
now
Not
only [so]
now
but
280190	even
280192	ourselves
280195	the
280197	firstfruit
280199	of the
Spirit
having
we
280204	also
ourselves
280207	in
ourselves
groan
divine adoption as sons
awaiting
280213	the
280215	redemption
280217	of the
280219	body
of us
280222	In this
for
hope
we were saved
280227	hope
however
being seen
not
is
hope
what
for
sees
any
one
does he hope for
If
however
what
not
we see
we hope for
280246	in
patience
we await
Likewise
now
280252	also
280254	the
Spirit
joins to help
280258	the
280260	weakness
of us
the
for
things which
we should pray for
as
it behooves
not
we know
but
280272	Himself
280274	the
Spirit
makes intercession
280278	with groanings
inexpressible
The [One]
now
searching
280284	-
hearts
knows
what [is]
280289	the
280291	mindset
280293	of the
Spirit
because
280297	according to
God
He intercedes
280301	for
[the] saints
We know
now
that
to those
loving
280309	-
God
all things
works together
280314	for
good
to those
280318	according to
[His] purpose
called
being
For
those whom
He foreknew
also
He predestined [to be]
280328	conformed to
280330	the
280332	image
280334	of the
280336	Son
of Him
280339	for
-
to be
Him
firstborn
280345	among
280347	many
brothers
Those whom
then
He predestined
these
also
He called
and
whom
He called
these
also
He justified
whom
then
He justified
these
also
He glorified
What
then
will we say
280371	to
these things
If
280375	-
God [is]
280378	for
us
who [can be]
280382	against
us
He who
indeed
280387	the
280389	own
Son
not
spared
but
280395	for
280397	us
all
gave up
Him
how
not
280404	also
280406	with
Him
280409	things
all
us
will He grant
Who
will bring an accusation
280416	against
280418	[the] elect
of God
God [is]
the [One]
justifying
Who [is]
the [one]
condemning
[For it is] Christ
Jesus
the [one]
having died
rather
now
having been raised up
who
is
280436	at [the]
280438	right hand
280440	-
of God
who
and
is interceding
280446	for
us
Who
us
will separate
280452	from
280454	the
280456	love
280458	-
of Christ
Tribulation
or
distress
or
persecution
or
famine
or
nakedness
or
danger
or
sword
As
it has been written
-
280477	For the sake
of you
we face death
280481	all
280483	the
day
we were regarded
280487	as
280489	sheep
of slaughter
But
280493	in
280495	these things
all
we more than conquer
280499	through
the [One]
having loved
us
I am persuaded
for
that
neither
death
nor
life
nor
angels
nor
principalities
nor
things present
nor
things to come
nor
powers
nor
height
nor
depth
nor
280526	any
280528	created thing
other
will be able
us
to separate
280534	from
280536	the
280538	love
280540	-
of God
280543	-
280545	in
Christ
Jesus
280549	the
280551	Lord
of us
[The] truth
I speak
280556	in
Christ
Not
I am lying
bearing witness with
me
280563	the
280565	conscience
of me
280568	in [the]
280570	Spirit
Holy
that
grief
to me
is
great
and
280579	unceasing
sorrow
280582	in the
280584	heart
of me
Could wish
for
a curse
to be
280591	myself
I
280594	separated from
280596	-
Christ
280599	for
280601	the
280603	brothers
of me
280606	-
280609	kinsmen
of me
280612	according to
[the] flesh
who
are
Israelites

280619	the
divine adoption as sons
and
280623	the
glory
and
280627	the
covenants
and
280631	the
lawgiving
and
280635	the
service

280639	the

patriarchs

280647	from
whom [is]
280650	-

280655	according to

[It is] not
as
however
that
has failed
280678	the
280680	word
280682	-

for
280687	all
280689	who [are]

Israel

Israel
Nor
because
they are

280705	In
Isaac
will be named

280716	children
280718	of the

280736	as

280742	the

to Sarah

Rebecca
280767	by
one
conception

not yet
for
having been born
nor

280783	anything

so that
280789	the
280792	according to
election
280795	purpose
280797	-
of God
might stand
not
280802	of
works

280806	of
the [One]
calling
it was said
to her
-
280813	The
older
will serve
280817	the
younger
As
it has been written
280822	-
Jacob
I loved
280826	-
but
Esau
I hated
What
then
shall we say
Not
injustice
280836	with
280838	-
God [is there]
Never
may it be
280843	To
Moses
for
He says
I will show mercy to
whom
-
I may show mercy
and
I will have compassion on
whom
-
I may have compassion
So
then
[it is] not
of the
willing
nor
of the
running
but
280866	-
280868	showing mercy
of God
Says
for
280873	the
Scripture
280876	to
Pharaoh
-
280880	For
280882	this very
therefore
I have raised up
you
so that
I might show
280889	in
you
280892	the
280894	power
of Me
and
that
should be declared
280900	the
280902	name
of Me
280905	in
280907	all
280909	the
earth
So
then
to whom
He wants
He shows mercy
whom
now
He wants
He hardens
You will say
to me
then
Why
still
does He find fault
280927	The
for
280930	purpose
of Him
who
is resisting
280935	O
man
but rather
you
who
are
-
answering against
280944	-
God
Not
will say
280949	the
thing formed
to the [One]
having formed [it]
Why
me
have you made
like this
Or
not
has
280961	authority
280963	the
potter
280966	over the
clay
280969	out of
280971	the
280973	same
lump
to make
one
indeed
280979	unto
honor
vessel
one
however
280985	unto
dishonor
What if
now
desiring
280991	-
God
to show
280995	the
wrath
and
to make known
281000	the
281002	power
of Him
bore
281006	with
281008	much
patience
281012	[the] vessels
of wrath
having been fitted
281016	for
destruction
also
that
He might make known
281022	the
281024	riches
281026	of the
281028	glory
of Him
281031	upon
281033	[the] vessels
of mercy
which
He prepared beforehand
281038	for
glory
whom
even
He has called
us
not
281046	only
281048	out from
[the] Jews
but
281052	also
281054	out from
[the] Gentiles
As
281058	also
281060	in
281062	-
Hosea
He says
I will call
281067	that which [is]
281069	not
281071	people
of Me
281074	people
of Me
and
her
not
having been loved
having been loved
and
It will happen that
281084	in
281086	the
place
where
it was said
to them
Not
281093	people
My [are]
You
there
they will be called
281099	sons
281101	of God
[the] living
Isaiah
also
cries out
281107	concerning
281109	-
Israel
Though
shall be
281114	the
281116	number
281118	of the
281120	sons
of Israel
281123	as
281125	the
281127	sand
281129	of the
sea
281132	[only] the
remnant
will be saved
[The] sentence
for
concluding
and
bringing swiftly
will perform [the]
Lord
281143	upon
281145	the
earth
And
as
foretold
Isaiah
If
not
281154	[the] Lord
of Hosts
had left
us
descendants
281160	like
Sodom
-
we would have become
and
281166	like
Gomorrah
-
we would have been made
What
then
will we say
That
Gentiles
-
not
pursuing
righteousness
have attained
righteousness
righteousness
now
281184	that [is]
281186	by
faith
Israel
however
pursuing
281192	a law
of righteousness
281195	to
[that] law
not
did attain
281200	Because of
why
Because [it was]
not
281205	by
faith
but
as
281210	by
works
They stumbled
281214	over the
281216	stone
281218	-
of stumbling
as
it has been written
Behold
I lay
281225	in
Zion
281228	a stone
of stumbling
and
281232	a rock
of offense
and
the [one]
believing
281238	on
Him
never
will be put to shame
Brothers
281244	the
indeed
281247	desire
281249	-
281251	of my
heart
and
281255	the
281258	supplication
281260	to
281262	-
God
281265	on behalf of
them
281268	[is] for
salvation
I bear witness
for
about them
that
281275	zeal
for God
they have
but
not
281281	according to
knowledge
Being ignorant of
for
281286	the
281289	-
of God
righteousness
and
281294	the
own
seeking
to establish
281299	to the
281301	righteousness
281303	-
of God
not
they submitted
281308	[The] end
for
of law
[is] Christ
281313	unto
righteousness
281316	to everyone
-
believing
Moses
for
writes
-
281324	[of] the
righteousness
281327	that [is]
281329	of
law
281332	The
281334	having done
man
will live
281338	by
them
281341	The
however
281345	of
faith
righteousness
thus
speaks
Not
you should say
281353	in
281355	the
281357	heart
of you
Who
will ascend
281362	into
281364	-
heaven
that
is
Christ
to bring down
or
Who
will descend
281374	into
281376	the
abyss
that
is
Christ
281382	out from
[the] dead
to bring up
But
what
says it
281389	Near
you
281392	the
word
is
281396	in
281398	the
281400	mouth
of you
and
281404	in
281406	the
281408	heart
of you
That
is
281413	the
281415	word
281417	-
of faith
which
we proclaim
that
if
you confess
281425	with
281427	the
281429	mouth
of you
[The] Lord [is]
Jesus
and
believe
281436	in
281438	the
281440	heart
of you
that
281444	-
God
Him
raised
281449	out from
[the] dead
you will be saved
In the heart
for
is belief
281456	unto
righteousness
in the mouth
now
is confession
281462	unto
salvation
Says
for
281467	the
Scripture
281470	Everyone
-
believing
281474	on
Him
not
will be put to shame
Not
for
there is
281482	difference
Jew
between
and
Greek
281488	-
for
281491	the same
Lord
of all
is rich
281496	toward
281498	all
those
calling
Him
281503	Whoever
for
that
-
shall call upon
281509	the
281511	name
of [the] Lord
will be saved
How
then
shall they call
281518	on [Him]
whom
not
they believed
How
now
shall they believe on [Him]
of whom
not
they have heard
How
now
shall they hear
281532	apart from
preaching
How
now
shall they preach
if
not
they are sent
As
it has been written
How
beautiful
281545	the
281547	feet
of those
proclaiming good news
good things
But
not
all
heeded
281556	the
good news
Isaiah
for
says
Lord
who
has believed
281565	the
281567	report
of us
So
281571	-
faith [is]
281574	from
hearing
281577	-
and
hearing
281581	through
281583	[the] word
of Christ
But
I ask
no
not
did they hear
Indeed
281592	Into
281594	all
281596	the
earth
has gone out
281600	the
281602	voice
of them
and
281606	to
281608	the
281610	ends
281612	of the
world
281615	the
281617	words
of them
But
I ask
not
Israel
not
did know
First
Moses
says
I
will provoke to jealousy
you
281632	by [those]
281634	not
a nation
281637	by
281639	a nation
without understanding
I will anger
you
Isaiah
then
is very bold
and
says
I was found
those
Me
not
seeking
manifest
I became
to those
Me
not
inquiring after
281660	As for
however
281663	-
Israel
he says
281667	All
281669	the
day
I have stretched out
281673	the
281675	hands
of Me
281678	to
281680	a people
disobeying
and
contradicting
I ask
then
not
did reject
281689	-
God
281692	the
281694	people
of Him
Never
may it be
281699	Also
for
I
an Israelite
am
281705	of [the]
281708	seed
of Abraham
281711	of [the] tribe
of Benjamin
Not
did reject
281716	-
God
281719	the
281721	people
of Him
whom
He foreknew
Or
not
know you
281729	in
Elijah
what
says
281734	the
Scripture
how
he pleads
281739	-
with God
281742	against
281744	-
Israel
Lord
281748	the
281750	prophets
of You
they have killed
281754	the
281756	altars
of You
they have torn down
and I
have been left
alone
and
they are seeking
281765	the
281767	life
of me
But
what [was]
spoken
to him
281774	the
divine answer
I have left
to Myself
281779	seven thousand
men
who
not
have bowed
[the] knee
281786	-
to Baal
Thus
then
281791	also
281793	in
281795	the
281797	present
time
a remnant
281801	according to
281803	[the] election
of grace
there has been
If
now
by grace
no longer
281811	from
works
otherwise
281815	-
grace
no longer
would be
grace
What
then
What
is seeking
Israel
this
not
it has obtained
281829	-
but
the elect
obtained [it]
281834	The
now
rest
were hardened
as
it has been written
Gave
them
281843	-
God
281846	a spirit
of stupor
281849	eyes
281851	-
not
to see
and
281856	ears
281858	-
not
to hear
281862	unto
281864	the
281866	today
day
And
David
says
Let be
281873	the
281875	table
of them
281878	for
a snare
and
281882	for
a trap
and
281886	for
a stumbling block
and
281890	for
281892	a retribution
to them
let be darkened
281896	the
281898	eyes
of them
-
not
to see
and
281905	the
281907	backs
of them
281910	for
ever
bent over
I ask
then
not
did they stumble
that
they might fall
Never
may it be
But
281923	in the
281925	of them
trespass
281928	-
[is] salvation
281931	to the
Gentiles
281934	so as
-
to provoke to jealousy
them
If
however
281941	the
281943	trespass
of them
281946	[is] riches
of [the] world
and
281950	the
281952	failure
of them
281955	[is the] riches
of [the] Gentiles
281958	how much
more
281961	the
281963	fullness
of them
To you
now
I am speaking
281969	the
Gentiles
281972	Upon
as much as
indeed
therefore
am
I
281979	of [the] Gentiles
apostle
281982	the
281984	ministry
of me
I magnify
if
at all
I shall provoke to jealousy
281991	of me
281993	the
flesh
and
shall save
281998	some
282000	of
them
If
for
282005	the
282007	rejection
of them
282010	[is the] reconciliation
of [the] world
what [will be]
282014	the
acceptance
if
not
life
282020	out from
[the] dead
If
now
282025	the
firstfruit
[is] holy
282029	also
282031	the
lump
and
if
282036	the
root
[is] holy
282040	also
282042	the
branches
If
however
282047	some
282049	of the
branches
were broken off
you
now
a wild olive tree
being
were grafted in
282058	among
them
and
282062	a fellow-partaker
282064	of the
282066	root
282068	of the
282070	fatness
282072	of the
olive tree
have become
not
boast over
282078	the
branches
If
now
you boast against [them]
not
you
282086	the
root
support
but
282091	the
root
you
You will say
then
Were broken off
branches
that
I
might be grafted in
Rightly so
282103	by the
unbelief
they were broken off
you
however
282109	-
by faith
stand
Not
high
be minded
but
be afraid
If
for
282120	-
God
282123	the
282126	according to
nature
branches
not
spared
neither
you
will He spare
Behold
therefore
282137	[the] kindness
and
severity
of God
282142	upon
indeed
those
having fallen
severity
282148	toward
however
you
282152	kindness
of God
if
you continue in
282157	the
kindness
otherwise
282161	also
you
will be cut off
Even they
now
if
not
they continue
282170	-
in unbelief
will be grafted in
able
for
is
282177	-
God
again
to graft in
them
If
for
you
282186	out of
282188	the
282191	according to
nature
were cut off
a wild olive tree
and
282197	contrary to
nature
were grafted
282201	into
a cultivated olive tree
282204	how much
more
282207	these
282209	who
282211	according to
nature [are]
will be grafted into
282215	the
282217	own
olive tree
Not
for
I want
you
to be ignorant
brothers
282227	of the
mystery
this
that
not
you may be
282234	in
yourselves
wise
that
a hardening
282240	in
part
282243	-
to Israel
has happened
282247	until
that
282250	the
282252	fullness
282254	of the
Gentiles
may come in
and
so
282260	all
Israel
will be saved
as
it has been written
Will come
282267	out of
Zion
the [One]
Delivering
He will remove
ungodliness
282274	from
Jacob
And
this [is]
to them
282280	the
282283	from
Me
covenant
when
I shall take away
282289	the
282291	sins
of them
282294	As regards
indeed
282297	the
gospel
[they are] enemies
282301	on account of
you
282304	As regards
however
282307	the
election
beloved
282311	on account of
282313	the
patriarchs
Irrevocable
for
282318	[are] the
gifts
and
282322	the
282324	calling
282326	-
of God
Just as
for
you
once
were disobedient
282334	-
to God
now
however
have been shown mercy
282340	the
282342	of these

we live
if
also

this
for
Christ
died

that
both [the]

He might rule over
You
however
why
judge you
283379	the
283381	brother
or you
or
283385	also
you
why
do despise
283390	the
283392	brother
of you
All
for
we will stand before
283398	the
283400	judgment seat
283402	of
God
It has been written
for
Live
I
says
[the] Lord
that
to Me
will bow
283414	every
knee
and
283418	every
tongue
will confess
283422	-
to God
So
then
283427	each
of us
283430	concerning
himself
account
will give
283435	-
to God
No longer
therefore
one another
should we judge
but
this
determine
rather
-
not
to put
[any] stumbling block
283450	before [your]
brother
or
snare
I know
and
I am persuaded
283458	in [the]
Lord
Jesus
that
nothing [is]
unclean
283465	of
itself
if
not
to him
reckoning
anything
unclean
to be
to that one
unclean [it is]
If
for
283479	on account of
food
283482	the
283484	brother
of you
is grieved
no longer
283489	according to
love
are you walking
Not
283494	with the
283496	food
of you
that one
destroy
283501	for
whom
Christ
died
Not
let be spoken of as evil
therefore
283509	your
283511	-
good
Not
for
is
283517	the
283519	kingdom
283521	-
of God

and
drinking
but
righteousness
and
peace

283532	joy
283534	in [the]

283545	-
Christ
[is] well-pleasing
283549	-
to God
and
approved
283554	-
by men
So
then
283559	the things
283561	-
of peace
we should pursue
and
283566	the things
283568	-
for edification
283571	-
283573	among
each other

283581	the

283585	-
of God
All things
indeed [are]
clean
but
[it is] wrong
283593	to the
man
-
283597	through
a stumbling block
eating

-
neither
to eat
meat
nor
to drink
wine
nor [anything]
283610	in
which
283613	the

283623	to

the [one]
not
judging
himself
283637	in
what
he approves
The [one]
however
doubting
if
he eats
has been condemned
because [it is]

283649	of
faith
283652	everything
now
that [is]
not
283657	of

283672	of the
weak
to bear
and
not
ourselves

283680	Each
of us
283683	the

283687	unto
283689	the
good
283692	for
edification
283695	Even
for

not

as
it has been written
283707	The
283709	reproaches
of those

have fallen
283715	on

Whatever
for
was written in the past
283721	for
283723	-
283725	our

was written
so that
283730	through
283732	-
endurance

283736	through
283738	the
283740	encouragement
283742	of the
Scriptures

hope
we might have
283749	The
now
283752	God
283754	-
of endurance
and
283758	-
encouragement
may He give
you
283763	the
same
to be of mind
283767	with
one another
283770	according to
Christ
Jesus
so that
with one accord
283776	with
283778	one
mouth
you may glorify
283782	the
283784	God
and
Father
283788	of the
283790	Lord
of us

Therefore
receive
one another
as
283799	also

Christ
received
you
283806	to
283808	[the] glory
283810	-
of God
I say
for
Christ
283816	a servant
to have become
of [the] circumcision
283820	for
283822	[the] truth
of God
283825	in order
-
to confirm
283829	the
283831	promises given
283833	to the
fathers
283836	-
and [for]
the Gentiles
283840	for
mercy
to glorify
283844	-
God
as
it has been written
283849	Because of
this
I will praise
You
283854	among
[the] Gentiles
and
283858	to the
283860	name
of You
will I sing
And
again
it says
Rejoice you
Gentiles
283869	with
283871	the
283873	people
of Him
And
again
Praise
283879	all
283881	the
Gentiles
283884	the
Lord
and
praise
Him
283890	all
283892	the
peoples
And
again
Isaiah
says
There will be
283900	the
283902	root
283904	-
of Jesse

I am persuaded
now
283956	brothers
of me
283959	also
283961	myself
I
283964	concerning
you
that
283968	also
you yourselves
full
are
of goodness
being filled
283975	with all
283977	-
knowledge
being able
283981	also
one another
to admonish
More boldly
however
I have written
to you
283989	in
part
as
reminding
you
283995	because of
283997	the
grace
-
having been given
to me
284003	by
284005	-
God
284008	for
-
to be
me
284013	a minister
Christ
of Jesus
284017	to
284019	the
Gentiles
administering the sacred service
284023	of the
284025	gospel
284027	-
of God
so that
might become
284032	the
284034	offering
284036	of the
Gentiles
acceptable
having been sanctified
284041	in [the]
284043	Spirit
Holy
I have
therefore
284048	the
284050	boasting
284052	in
Christ
Jesus
284056	in the things
284058	pertaining to
284060	-
God
Not
for
will I dare
284066	anything
to speak of
what
except
has accomplished
Christ
284073	through
me
284076	unto [the]
284078	obedience
of [the] Gentiles
by word
and
deed
284084	in [the]
284086	power
of signs
and
wonders
284091	in [the]
284093	power
284095	of [the] Spirit
of God
so as
for me
284100	from
Jerusalem
and
284104	around
284106	unto
284108	-
Illyricum
to have fully proclaimed
284112	the
284114	gospel
284116	-
of Christ
thus
now
being ambitious
to preach the gospel
284123	not
where
had been named
Christ
so that
not
284130	upon
284132	anotherâs
foundation
I might build
Rather
as
it has been written
They will see
to whom
not
it was proclaimed
284143	concerning
Him
and
those that
not
have heard
will understand
Therefore
also
I have been hindered
284154	-
many [times]
-
to come
284159	to
you
Now
however
no longer
a place
having
284167	in
284170	the
regions
these
a great desire
now
having had
-
to come
284179	to
you
284182	for
284184	many
years
whenever
-
I may go
284190	to
284192	-
Spain
I hope
for
going through
to see
you
and
284201	by
you
to be equipped
there
if
of you
first
284209	in
part
I should be filled
Now
however
I am going
284216	to
Jerusalem
ministering
284220	to the
saints
Were pleased
for
Macedonia
and
Achaia
284228	a contribution
certain
to make
284232	for
284234	the
284236	poor
284238	among the
saints
284241	-
284243	in
Jerusalem
They were pleased
for

debtors
they are
of them
If
for
284254	the things
284256	spiritual
of them
have shared in
284260	the
Gentiles
they ought
also
284265	in
284267	the
material things
to minister
to them
This
therefore
having finished
and
having sealed
to them
284279	the
fruit
this
I will set off
284284	through
you
284287	into

now
that
coming
284294	to

284321	the
284323	love
284325	of the

to strive together with
me
284330	in
284332	the
prayers
284335	for
me
284338	to
284340	-
God
so that
I may be delivered
284345	from
284347	those
refusing to be persuaded
284350	in
284352	-

and

284358	service
of me
284361	which [is]
284363	in
Jerusalem
acceptable
284367	to the
saints
may be
so that
284372	in
joy
having come
284376	to
you
284379	by [the]
284381	will
of God
I may be refreshed with
you
284386	-

For

than men

and
285524	the
285526	weakness
285528	-
of God
stronger
285532	-
than men
Consider
for
285537	the
285539	calling
of you
brothers
that
not
many
wise
285547	according to
flesh [were]
not

not
many
of noble birth
But
285557	the

285561	of the

has chosen
285565	-

285623	Out of
Him
however
you
are

who
has been made

unto us
285637	from
God

and
also
sanctification
and
redemption
in order that
as
it has been written
The [one]
boasting
285651	in [the]
Lord
let him boast
And I
having come
285657	to
you
brothers
came
not
285663	according to
285665	excellency
of speech
or
wisdom
proclaiming
to you
285672	the
285674	testimony
285676	-
of God
Nothing
for
I decided
anything
to know
285684	among
you
if
not
Jesus
Christ
and
285692	Him
having been crucified
And I
285696	in
weakness
and
285700	in
fear
and
285704	in
285706	trembling
much
was
285710	with
you
And
285714	the
285716	message
of me
and
285720	the
285722	preaching
of me
[were] not
285726	in
285728	persuasive
285730	of wisdom
words
but
285734	in
285736	demonstration
of [the] Spirit
and
of power
so that
285742	the
285744	faith
of you
not
might be
285749	in
285751	wisdom
of men
but
285755	in
285757	power
of God
Wisdom
however
we speak
285763	among
285765	the
mature
285768	wisdom
however
not
285773	the

nor
285778	of the
285780	rulers
285783	the
age
of this
who
are coming to naught
But
we speak
285791	of God
285793	wisdom
285795	in
a mystery
-
having been hidden
which
foreordained
285802	-
God
285805	before
285807	the
ages
285810	for
285812	glory
of us
which
285816	none
285818	of the
285820	rulers
285823	the
age
of this
has understood
if
for
they had understood [it]
not
-
285833	the
285835	Lord
285837	-
of glory
they would have crucified
but
as
it has been written
What
eye
not
has seen
and
ear
not
has heard
and
285853	into
285855	heart
of man
not
has entered
what
has prepared
285862	-
God
for those
loving
Him
To us
for
has revealed [it]
285871	-
God
285874	through
285876	the
Spirit
285879	The
for
Spirit
all things
searches
285885	even
285887	the
285889	depths
285891	-
of God
285894	Who
for
knows
among men
285899	the things
285901	of the
man
if
not
285906	the
285908	spirit
285910	of the
man
285913	that [is]
285915	within
him
So
285919	also
285921	the things
285923	-
of God
no one
knows
if
not
285930	the
285932	Spirit
285934	-
of God
We
now
not
285940	the
285942	spirit
285944	of the
world
have received
but
285949	the
Spirit
285952	who [is]
285954	from
285956	-
God
that
we may know
the things
285962	by
285964	-
God
having been granted
to us
which
also
we speak
not
285973	in
285976	taught
285978	of human
wisdom
words
but
285983	in [those]
285985	taught
of [the] Spirit
by spiritual [means]
spiritual things
communicating
285991	[The] natural
however
man
not
accepts
285997	the things
285999	of the
286001	Spirit
286003	-
of God
foolishness
for
to him
they are
and
not
he is able
to understand [them]
because
spiritually
they are discerned
286017	He who [is]
however
spiritual
judges
-
all things
he himself
however
286026	by
no one
is judged
Who
for
has known
286033	[the] mind
of [the] Lord
Who
will instruct
Him
We
however
286041	[the] mind
of Christ
have
And I
brothers
not
was able
to speak
to you
286051	as
to spiritual
but
286055	as
to fleshly
286058	as
286060	to infants
286062	in
Christ
Milk
you
I gave to drink
not
solid food
not yet
for
were you able
In fact
not
still
now
are you able
still
for
fleshly
you are
Where
for
286084	[are] among
you
jealousy
and
strife
not
fleshly
are you
and
286094	according to
man
are walking
When
for
might say
one
I
indeed
am
of Paul

however
I
of Apollos
not
fleshly
are you
Who
then

286130	the
Lord
has given
I
planted
Apollos
watered
but
286139	-
God
kept [it] growing
So
neither
the [one]
planting
is
anything
nor
the [one]
watering
but [only]
286153	the [One]
286155	giving growth

The [one]

now
and
the [one]
watering
one
are
each
now
286168	the
286170	own
reward
will receive
286174	according to
286176	the
286178	own
labor
286181	Of God
for
we are
fellow workers
286186	Godâs
field
286189	Godâs
building
you are
286193	According to
286195	the
286197	grace
286199	-
of God
-
having been given
to me
286205	as
286207	a wise
master builder
[the] foundation
I have laid
another
however
is building upon [it]
Each one
however
let take heed
how
he builds upon [it]
286220	Foundation
for
another
no one
is able
to lay
286227	besides
the [one]
being already laid
which
is
Jesus
Christ
If
now
anyone
builds
286239	upon
286241	the
foundation
gold
silver
286246	stones
precious
wood
hay
straw
286252	of each
286254	the
work
manifest
will become
286259	the
for
day
will disclose [it]
because
286265	in
fire
it is revealed
and
286270	of each
286272	the
work
what sort
it is
286277	the
fire
itself
will prove
If
286283	of anyone
286285	the
work
will remain
which
he built up
a reward
he will receive
If
286294	of anyone
286296	the
work
will be burned up
he will suffer loss
he himself
however
will be saved
so
however
as
286307	through
fire
Not
know you
that
286313	temple
of God
you yourselves are
and
286318	the
286320	Spirit
286322	-
of God
286325	in
you
dwells
If
anyone
286331	the
286333	temple
286335	-
of God
destroys
will destroy
him
286341	-
God
286344	-
for
286347	the temple
286349	-
of God
holy
is
which
are
you
No one
himself
let deceive
if
anyone
thinks [himself]
wise
to be
286365	among
you
286368	in
286371	the
age
this
foolish
let him become
so that
he may become
wise
286380	The
for
286383	wisdom
286386	of the
world
this
foolishness
286391	with
286393	-
God
is
It has been written
for
[He is] the [One]
catching
286401	the
wise
286404	in
286406	the
286408	craftiness
of them
And
again
[The] Lord
knows
286415	the
286417	thoughts
286419	of the
wise
that
they are
futile
Therefore
no one
let boast
286428	in
men
All things
for
of you
are
whether
Paul
or
Apollos
or
Cephas
or [the]
world
or
life
or
death
or
things present
or
things to come
all
yours
you
now
of Christ
Christ
now
of God
So
us
let regard
a man
as
286464	servants
of Christ
and
286468	stewards
286470	of the mysteries
of God
In this case
moreover
it is required
286476	in
286478	the
stewards
that
faithful
one
shall be found
Me
however
286487	to
the smallest matter
it is
that
286492	by
you
I be examined
or
286497	by
286499	a human
court
In fact
neither
myself
do I examine
Nothing
for
against myself
I am conscious of
yet
not
286512	by
this
have I been justified
the [One]
however
judging
me
[the] Lord
is
So then
not
286524	before [the]
time
anything
judge
until
-
shall have come
286532	the
Lord
who
both
will bring to light
286538	the
286540	hidden things
286542	-
of darkness
and
will make manifest
286547	the
286549	motives
286551	of the
hearts
and
then
286556	the
praise
will come
to each
286561	from
286563	-
God
These things
now
brothers
I have applied
286570	to
myself
and
Apollos
286575	on account of
you
so that
286579	in
us
you may learn
-
not
286585	beyond
what
has been written
that
not
one
286592	for
286594	-
one
you be puffed up
286598	over
286600	the
other
Who
for
you
makes different
What
now
have you
which
not
you did receive
If
now
also
you did receive [it]
why
boast you
as
not
having received [it]
Already
286623	satiated
you are
already
you have been enriched
286628	apart from
us
you reigned
and
I wish that
really
you did reign
so that
286637	also
we
you
might reign with
I think
for
286644	-
God
us
286648	-
apostles
last
has exhibited
286653	as
appointed to death
because
a spectacle
we have become
286659	to the
world
both
to angels
and
to men
We
[are] fools
286668	on account of
Christ
you
however
wise
286674	in
Christ
we
weak
you
however
strong
You
honored
we
however
without honor
286687	As far as
286689	the
286691	present
hour
both
we hunger
and
thirst
and
are poorly clad
and
are buffeted
and
wander homeless
and
we toil
working
286707	with [our]
286709	own
hands
Being reviled
we bless
being persecuted
we endure
being slandered
we entreat
286718	As
286720	[the] scum
286722	of the
earth
we have become
286726	of all [the]
refuse
286729	until
now
Not
shaming
you
do I write
these things
but
286738	as
286741	children
my
beloved
admonishing [you]
If
for
286748	ten thousand
guardians
you should have
286752	in
Christ
yet
not
286757	many
fathers
286760	in
for
Christ
Jesus
286765	through
286767	the
gospel
I
you
have begotten
I exhort
therefore
you
286776	imitators
of me
become
286780	On account of
286782	this
it [is]
I sent
to you
Timothy
who
is
286790	my
286793	child
beloved
and
faithful
286798	in [the]
Lord
who
you
will remind of
286804	the
286806	ways
of me
286809	that [are]
286811	in
Christ
Jesus
as
everywhere
286817	in
286819	every
church
I teach
As to
not
coming
now
of me
286828	to
you
have become puffed up
some
I will come
however
shortly
286836	to
you
if
286840	the
Lord
wills
and
I will find out
not
286847	the
286849	talk
of those
being puffed up
but
286854	the
power
Not
for
286859	in
word
286862	the
286864	kingdom
286866	-
of God [is]
but
286870	in
power
What
desire you
286875	With
a rod
I should come
286879	to
you
or
286883	in
love
286886	a spirit
then
of gentleness
Actually
is reported
286892	among
you
sexual immorality
and
286897	such
sexual immorality
as
not even
286902	among
286904	the
pagans
so as for
286908	[the] wife
one
286911	of the
father
to have
And
you
286917	puffed up
are
and
not
rather
have mourned
so that
might be taken
286926	out of
286928	midst
of you
the [one]
286933	the
deed
this
having done
I
indeed
though
being absent
286942	-
in body
being present
now
286947	-
in spirit
already
have judged
as
being present
the [one]
so
this
having produced
286958	in
286960	the
286962	name
286964	of the
Lord
Jesus
having been gathered together
you
and
286971	-
286973	of me
in spirit
286976	with
286978	the
286980	power
286982	of the
286984	Lord
of us
Jesus
to deliver
286989	-
such a one
286992	-
to Satan
286995	for
286997	destruction
286999	of the
flesh
so that
287003	the
spirit
may be saved
287007	in
287009	the
287011	day
287013	of the
Lord
Not
good [is]
287018	the
287020	boasting
of you
Not
know you
that
287026	a little
leaven
287029	all
287031	the
lump
leavens
Cleanse out
287036	the
287038	old
leaven
that
you may be
287043	a new
lump
as
you are
unleavened
287049	Also
for
287052	the
287054	Passover lamb
of us
has been sacrificed
Christ
so that
we might celebrate the feast
not
287062	with
287064	leaven
old
not
287068	with
287070	leaven
of malice
and
wickedness
but
287076	with
287078	unleavened [bread]
of sincerity
and
of truth
I wrote
to you
287085	in
287087	the
letter
not
to associate with
the sexually immoral
287093	not
altogether
287096	with the
287098	sexually immoral
287101	the
world
of this
or
287106	with the
covetous
and
swindlers
or
idolaters
since
you would need
then
287116	from
287118	the
world
to depart
Now
however
I wrote
to you
not
to associate with [him]
if
287129	anyone
a brother
being designated
he is
sexually immoral
or
a coveter
or
an idolater
or
verbal abuser
or
a drunkard
or
swindler
287145	with
such a one
not even
to eat
What
for
[is it] to me
287153	those
outside
to judge
Not
287158	those
within
you
do judge
287163	Those
however
outside
287167	-
God
will judge
Expel
287172	the
evil
287175	out from
287177	yourselves
that
Dare
287181	anyone
of you
a matter
having
287186	against
287188	the
other
go to law
287192	before
287194	the
unrighteous
and
not
287199	before
287201	the
saints
Or
not
know you
that
287208	the
saints
287211	the
world
will judge
And
if
287217	by
you
is to be judged
287221	the
world
unworthy
are you
287226	of cases
of the smallest
Not
know you
that
angels
we will judge
How much more
the things of this life
287236	The things of this life
indeed
so
judgment [as to]
if
you have
the [ones]
being despised
287245	in
287247	the
church
those
set you up
287252	For
shame
to you
I say this
Thus
not
is there
287260	among
you
287263	no one
a wise [man]
who
will be able
to decide
287269	in
287271	between
287273	the
287275	brother
of him
Instead
brother
287280	against
brother
goes to law
and
this
287286	before
unbelievers
Already
indeed
therefore
altogether
a defeat
for you
it is
that
lawsuits
you have
287299	among
one another
287302	Because of
why
not
rather
suffer wrong
287308	Because of
why
not
rather
be defrauded
But
you
do wrong
and
defraud
and
these things
to brothers
Or
not
know you
that
[the] unrighteous ones
287327	of God
[the] kingdom
not
will inherit
Not
be deceived
neither
the sexually immoral
nor
idolaters
nor
adulterers
nor
effeminate
nor
homosexuals
nor
thieves
nor
coveters
not
drunkards
nor
verbal abusers
nor
swindlers
287354	[the] kingdom
of God
will inherit
And
such
some [of]
you were
but
you were washed
but
you were sanctified
but
you were justified
287368	in
287370	the
287372	name
287374	of the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
and
287380	by
287382	the
287384	Spirit
287386	of the
287388	God
of us
All things
to me
are lawful
but
not
all things
do profit
All things
to me
are lawful
but
not
I
will be mastered
287405	by
anything
287408	The
foods
287411	for the
belly
and
287415	the
belly
287418	the
for foods
287421	-
but
God
both
this
and
these
will destroy
287430	-
and
the body [is]
not
287435	-
for sexual immorality
but
287439	for the
Lord
and
287443	the
Lord
287446	for the
body
287449	-
And
God
both
287454	the
Lord
has raised up
and
us
will raise out
287461	by
287463	the
287465	power
of Him
Not
know you
that
287471	the
287473	bodies
of you
287476	members
of Christ
are
Having taken
then
287482	the
287484	members
287486	of the
Christ
shall I make
287490	[them] of a prostitute
members
Never
may it be
Or
not
know you
that
the [one]
being joined
287501	to the
prostitute
287504	one
body
is
Will become
for
it says
287511	the
two
287514	into
287516	flesh
one
The [one]
however
being joined
287522	to the
Lord
287525	one
spirit
is
Flee
287530	-
sexual immorality
287533	Every
sin
whatever
if
might do
a man
287540	outside
287542	the
body
is
the [one]
however
sinning sexually
287549	against
287551	the
287553	own
body
sins
Or
not
know you
that
287561	the
287563	body
of you
287566	a temple
287568	of the
287571	in
you
287574	Holy
Spirit
is
whom
you have
287580	from
God
And
not
you are
your own
you were bought
for
with a price
glorify
therefore
287592	-
God
287595	in
287597	the
287599	body
of you
287602	Concerning
now
the things about which
you wrote
[It is] good
for a man
a woman
not
to touch
287612	Because of
however
287615	-
sexual immorality
each man
287619	the [own]
287621	of him
wife
let have
and
each [woman]
287627	the
287629	own
husband
let have
287633	To the
wife
287636	the
husband
287639	the
duty
let fulfill
likewise
now
287645	also
287647	the
wife
287650	to the
husband
287653	The
wife
287656	the
287658	own
body
not
has authority over
but
287664	the
husband
likewise
now
287669	also
287671	the
husband
287674	of the
287676	own
body
not
has authority over
but
287682	the
wife
Not
deprive
one another
if
not
-
287691	by
mutual agreement
287694	for
a time
that
you might be at leisure
287699	-
for prayer
and
again
287704	together
287706	the
same
be
so that
not
may tempt
you
287714	-
Satan
287717	through
287719	the
287721	lack of self-control
of you
This
now
I say
287727	by way of
concession
not
287731	by way of
command
I wish
now
287736	all
men
to be
287740	like
287742	even
myself
But
each
287747	his own
has
gift
287751	from
God
one [has]
indeed
this
one
however
that
I say
now
287762	to the
unmarried
and
287766	to the
widows
[it is] good
for them
if
they should remain
287773	as
even I
If
however
not
they have self-control
let them marry
better
for
it is
to marry
than
to burn with passion
To those
now
having married
I give this charge
not
I
but
287794	the
Lord
A wife
287798	from
a husband
not
is to be separated
if
however
indeed
she is separated
let her remain
unmarried
or
287810	to the
husband
be reconciled
and
a husband
a wife
not
is to send away
287819	To the
now
rest
I say
I
287825	not
287827	the
Lord
If
287831	any
brother
287834	a wife
has
unbelieving
and
she
consents
to dwell
287842	with
him
not
let him divorce
her
And
a woman
any
has
287852	a husband
unbelieving
and
he
consents
to dwell
287859	with
her
not
let her divorce
287864	the
husband
Is sanctified
for
287869	the
287871	husband
287873	-
unbelieving
287876	in
287878	the
wife
and
is sanctified
287883	the
287885	wife
287887	-
unbelieving
287890	in
287892	the
husband
else
then
287897	the
287899	children
of you
unclean
are
now
however
holy
they are
If
however
287910	the
unbeliever
separates himself
let him separate himself
not
is under bondage
287917	the
brother
or
287921	the
sister
287924	in
287926	-
such [cases]
287929	Into
however
peace
has called
you
287935	-
God
How
for
know you
wife
if
287943	the
husband
you will save
Or
how
know you
husband
if
287952	the
wife
you will save
If
not
to each
as
has assigned
287961	the
Lord
to each
as
has called
287967	-
God
so
let him walk
And
thus
287974	in
287977	the
churches
all
I prescribe
Having been circumcised
anyone
was called
Not
let him be uncircumcised
287987	In
uncircumcision
was called
anyone
Not
let Him be circumcised
287994	-
Circumcision
nothing
is
and
288000	-
uncircumcision
nothing
is
but
288006	keeping
288008	[the] commandments
of God
Each
288012	in
288014	the
calling
in which
he has been called
288019	in
this
let him abide
Slave [being]
were you called
not
to you
let it be a care
but
if
also
you are able
free
to become
rather
take advantage
288036	The [one]
for
288040	in
[the] Lord
having been called
[being] a slave
288045	a freedman
of [the] Lord
is
likewise
288051	the [one]
free
having been called
288055	a slave
is
of Christ
With a price
you were bought
not
become
288063	slaves
of men
Each
288067	wherein
that
he was called
brothers
288072	in
that
let him abide
288076	with
God
288079	Concerning
now
288082	the
virgins
288085	a commandment
of [the] Lord
not
I have
judgment
however
I give
288093	as
having received mercy
288096	from
[the] Lord
trustworthy
to be
I think
therefore
this
good
is
288106	because of
288108	the
288110	present
necessity
that
[it is] good
for a man
-
in the same manner
to remain
Have you been bound
to a wife
Not
seek
to be loosed
Have you been loosed
288125	from
a wife
Not
seek
a wife
If
however
also
you shall have married
not
you did sin
and
if
shall have married
288140	the
virgin
not
she did sin
tribulation
however
288147	in the
flesh
will have
288151	-
such
I
now
you
am sparing
This
now
I say
brothers
288162	The
season
288165	shortened
is
288168	-
From now on
that
288172	both
those
having
wives
as
none
having
should be
and
those
weeping
as
not
weeping
and
those
rejoicing
as
not
rejoicing
and
those
buying
as
not
possessing
and
those
using
288202	the
world
as
not
using [it] as their own
Is passing away
for
288210	the
288212	present form
288215	of the
world
this
I desire
now
you
without concern
to be
288224	The
unmarried man
cares for
288228	the things
288230	of the
Lord
how
he should please
288235	the
Lord
the [one]
however
having been married
cares for
288242	the things
288244	of the
world
how
he should please
288249	the
wife
and
is divided
And
288255	the
woman
288258	-
unmarried
and
288262	-
virgin
cares for
288266	the things
288268	of the
Lord
that
she should be
holy
both
288275	in
body
and
288279	in
spirit
the [one]
however
having been married
cares for
288286	the things
288288	of the
world
how
she should please
288293	the
husband
This
now
288298	for
288300	the
288303	of you
yourselves
benefit
I say
not
that
a restraint
you
I might place upon
but
288314	for
288316	what
[is] seemly
and
devoted
288321	to the
Lord
without distraction
If
however
anyone
to be behaving improperly
288329	to
288331	the
288333	virgin
of him
supposes
if
she is
beyond youth
and
so
it ought
to be
what
he wills
let him do
not
he does sin
let them marry
He who
however
stands
288353	in
288355	the
288357	heart
of him
firm
not
having
necessity
authority
however
having
288367	over
288369	the
288371	own
will
and
this
has judged
288377	in
288379	the
288381	own
heart
to keep
288385	-
288387	the
virgin
well
he will do
So then
also
the [one]
marrying
288396	the
288398	own
virgin
well
does
and
the [one]
not
marrying
better
will do
A wife
is bound
288411	for
288413	as long as
time
may live
288417	the
288419	husband
of her
if
however
shall have died
288425	the
husband
free
she is
to whom
she wills
to be married
only
288434	in
[the] Lord
More blessed
however
she is
if
in the same manner
she should remain
288443	according to
288445	-
288447	my
judgment
I think
now
myself also
288453	[the] Spirit
of God
to have
288457	Concerning
now
288460	the things
sacrificed to idols
we know
indeed
all
knowledge
we have
288468	-
Knowledge
puffs up
288472	-
but
love
builds up
If
anyone
thinks
to have known
anything
not yet
does he know
as
it is necessary
to know
If
however
anyone
loves
288491	-
God
he
is known
288496	by
Him
288499	Concerning
288501	the
288503	eating
therefore
288506	of the
things sacrificed to idols
we know
that
nothing
an idol
288513	[is] in
[the] world
and
that [there is]
no
God
if
not
one
Even
truly
if indeed
there are
288527	[those] called
gods
whether
288531	in
heaven
or
288535	on
earth
as
there are
gods
many
and
lords
many
yet
to us
[there is] one
God
288549	the
Father
288552	of
whom [are]
288555	the things
all
and
we
288560	for
Him
and
one
Lord
Jesus
Christ
288568	by
whom [are]
288571	the things
all
and
we
288576	through
Him
But
not
288581	in
all [is]
288584	this
knowledge
Some
now
288589	-
by habit
288592	until
now
288595	of the
idol
as of
a thing sacrificed to an idol
eat
and
288602	the
288604	conscience
of them
weak
being
it is defiled
Food
however
us
not
will commend
288615	to
God
neither
if
not
we should eat
do we come short
nor
if
we should eat
have we an advantage
Be careful
however
lest
somehow
288632	the
288634	right
of you
this
an occasion of stumbling
becomes
288640	to those
being weak
If
for
anyone
sees
you
-
having
knowledge
288651	in
an idolâs temple
eating
not
288656	the
288658	conscience
of him
weak
being
will be built up
288664	so as
the
288667	things
sacrificed to idols
to eat
Is destroyed
for
the [one]
being weak
288675	through
288677	-
288679	your
knowledge
288682	the
brother
288685	for
whom
Christ
died
Thus
then
sinning
288693	against
288695	the
brothers
and
wounding
288700	their
288702	-
288704	conscience
being weak
288707	against
Christ
you sin
Therefore
if
food
snares
288715	the
288717	brother
of me
288720	never
not
shall I eat
meat
288725	to
288727	the
age
so that
not
288732	the
288734	brother
of me
I might snare
Not
am I
free
Not
am I
an apostle
Not
Jesus
288746	the
288748	Lord
of us
have I seen
Not
288753	the
288755	work
of me
you
are
288760	in
[the] Lord
If
to others
not
I am
an apostle
yet
at least
to you
I am
288772	the
for
288776	seal
of my
288779	the
apostleship
you
are
288784	in
[the] Lord
288787	-
288789	My
defense
to those
me
examining
is
this
No
not
have we
[the] right
to eat
and
to drink
No
not
have we
authority
a sister
a wife
to take about
as
288812	also
288814	the
288816	other
apostles
and
288820	the
288822	brothers
288824	of the
Lord
and
Cephas
Or
only
I
and
Barnabas
not
have we
authority
not
to work
Who
serves as a soldier
288841	at his own
expense
at any time
Who
plants
a vineyard
and
288849	the
288851	fruit
of it
not
does eat
Or
who
shepherds
a flock
and
288861	from
288863	the
288865	milk
288867	of the
flock
not
does drink
Not
288873	according to
man
these things
do I speak
Or
288879	also
288881	the
law
these things
not
says
288887	In
for
288890	the
288892	of Moses
law
it has been written
Not
you shall muzzle
288898	an ox
treading out grain
Not
288902	for the
oxen
is there care
288906	-
with God
Or
288910	because of
us
entirely
is He speaking
288915	For sake of
us
for
it was written
because
ought
288922	in
hope
the [one]
plowing
to plow
and
the [one]
threshing
288931	in
hope
-
to partake
If
we
among you
288939	-
spiritual things
have sown
[is it] a great thing
if
we
288946	from you
288948	-
material things
will reap
If
others
288954	of the
288956	over you
authority
partake
[should] not
more
we
But
not
we did use
288967	the
right
this
Instead
all things
we bear
so that
not
288976	any
hindrance
we should place
288980	to the
288982	gospel
288984	of
Christ
Not
know you
that
those
288991	in the
temple
working
288995	the things
288997	of
288999	the
temple
eat
those
289004	at the
altar
attending
289008	in the
altar
partake
So
289013	also
289015	the
Lord
has prescribed
to those
289020	the
gospel
proclaiming
289024	from
289026	the
gospel
to live
I
however
not
have used
289034	none
of these
Neither
have I written
now
these things
that
thus
it should be
289044	with
me
[it were] good
for
me
rather
to die
than
289053	the
289055	boasting
of me
anyone
will make void
If
for
I preach the gospel
nothing
there is
to me
boasting
necessity
for
me
is laid upon
Woe
however
to me
be
if
not
I should preach the gospel
If
for
willingly
this
I do
a reward
I have
if
however
unwillingly
a stewardship
I am entrusted with
What
then
289092	of me
is
289095	the
reward
That
in preaching the gospel
free of charge
I should offer
289102	the
gospel
289105	so as
-
not
to use up
289110	the
289112	right
of me
289115	in
289117	the
gospel
Free
for
being
289123	from
all
to all
myself
I became servant
so that
289130	the
more
I might gain
And
I became
289136	to the
Jews
289139	like
a Jew
so that
Jews
I might win
289145	To those
289147	under
[the] Law
289150	as
289152	under
[the] law
not
being
myself
289158	under
[the] law
so that
289162	those
289164	under
[the] law
I might win
289168	To those
outside [the] Law
289171	like
outside [the] Law
not
being
289176	outside [the] law
of God
but
289180	under [the] law
to Christ
so that
I might win
289185	those
outside [the] Law
I became
289189	to the
weak
weak
that
289194	the
weak
I might win
289198	These things
to all
I have become
all
so that
by all means
some
I might save
All [things]
now
I do
289210	on account of
289212	the
gospel
that
289216	a fellow partaker
with it
I might become
Not
know you
that
those
289224	in
a race course
running
all
indeed

289234	the
prize
Thus
run
that
you might obtain [it]
289241	Everyone

striving
in all things
controls himself
they
indeed
then
that
289252	a perishable
crown
they might receive
we
however
an imperishable
I
therefore
thus
run
as
not
uncertainly
so
I fight
as
not

beating
But
I batter
289274	of me
289276	the
body
and
bring [it] into servitude
not
hardly
to others
having preached
myself
disqualified
I might be
Not
I want
for
you
to be ignorant
brothers
that
289296	the
289298	fathers
of us
all
289302	under
289304	the
cloud
were
and
all
289310	through
289312	the
sea
passed
and
all
289318	into
289320	-
Moses
were baptized
289324	in
289326	the
cloud
and
289330	in
289332	the
sea
and
all
289337	the
289339	same
289341	spiritual

ate

for

289361	accompanying [them]

289364	the
rock
then
was
289369	-
Christ
Nevertheless
not
289374	with
289376	-
289378	most
of them
was well pleased
289382	-
God
they were strewn
for
289387	in
289389	the
wilderness
These things
now
289394	types
to us
have become
289398	for
-
not
to be
us
289404	desirers
of evil things
as
they also
desired
Neither
idolaters
are you to be
as
289414	some
of them
as
it has been written
Sat down
289420	the
people
to eat
and
to drink
and
rose up
to play
Neither
should we commit sexual immorality
as
289432	some
of them
committed sexual immorality
and
fell
289438	in one
day
289441	twenty
thousand
Neither
should we test
289446	the
Christ
as
289450	some
of them
tested
and
289455	by
289457	-
serpents
were destroyed
Neither
are you to grumble
as
289464	some
of them
grumbled
and
perished
289470	by
289472	the
Destroyer
These things
now
[as] types
happened
to them
were written
then
289482	for
289484	admonition
of us
289487	to
whom
289490	the
289492	ends
289494	of the
ages
are arrived
Therefore
the [one]
thinking
to stand
let him take heed
lest
he fall
Temptation
you
not
has seized
if
not
what is common to man
faithful
now
289514	-
[is] God
who
not
will allow
you
to be tempted
289522	beyond
what
you are able
but
will provide
289528	with
289530	the
temptation
289533	also
289535	the
escape
-
to be able
to endure [it]
Therefore
289542	beloved
of me
flee
289546	from

idolatry
As
to sensible [ones]
I speak

for yourselves

I say

of blessing

we bless

we break
not
289584	a participation
289586	in the

of Christ
is it
Because [there is]

we are
289604	-
for

Consider
289617	-
289619	Israel
289621	according to

Not
those

289627	the
sacrifices

289632	in the
altar
are
What
then
do I mean
That
what is sacrificed to an idol
anything
is
or
that
an idol
anything
is
Rather
that
what
sacrifice
to demons
and
289654	not
to God
they sacrifice
Not
I do wish

you

with demons
to be

you are able
289680	of [the] table
of [the] Lord

do we provoke to jealousy

Lord
Not
stronger
than He

All things

For
290148	the
long hair
290151	instead
of a covering
is given
to her
If
now
anyone
is inclined
contentious
to be

290163	such

nor
290169	the

of God
In this
now

I do praise

290189	for

worse
you come together
First
indeed
for
coming together
you
290200	in
an assembly
I hear
divisions
290205	among
you
there to be
and
290210	in part
it
I believe
It behooves
for
290216	also
factions
290219	among
you
there to be
so that
290224	also
290226	the
approved
evident
should become
290231	among
you
Coming
therefore
of you
290237	together
290239	in one
place
not
it is
290244	[the] Lordâs
supper
to eat
One

supper
takes first
290256	in

eating
and
this [one]
indeed
is hungry
that [one]
however
is drunken
No
indeed
houses
not
have you
290272	in
which
to eat
and
to drink
Or
290279	the
290281	church
290283	-
of God
do you despise
and
put to shame
those
nothing
having
What
shall I say
to you
Shall I praise
you
290297	in

Not

that which
also
I delivered
to you
that
290315	the
Lord
Jesus
290319	in
290321	the
night
in which
He was betrayed
took
bread
and
having given thanks
He broke [it]
and
said
This
290334	of Me
is
290337	the
body
290340	which [is]

290411	death
290413	of the
Lord
you proclaim
290417	until
that
He should come
Therefore
whoever

should eat
290425	the
bread
or
should drink
290430	the
290432	cup
290434	of the
Lord
unworthily
guilty
will be
290441	of the
body
and
290445	of the
blood
290448	of the
Lord
Let examine
however
a man
himself
and
in this manner
290457	of
290459	the
bread
let him eat
and
290464	of
290466	the
cup
let him drink
The [one]

on himself
eats
and
drinks

290485	Because of
this
290488	among
you
many
[are] weak
and
sick
and
are fallen asleep
many
If
for
ourselves
we were judging
not
-
we would come under judgment
Being judged
however
290507	by
290509	the
Lord
we are disciplined
so that
not
290515	with
290517	the
world
we should be condemned
So then
290522	brothers
of me
coming together
290526	in order

to eat

wait for
If
anyone
is hungry
290535	at

let him eat

not
290541	for

you might come together
290545	-

the other things
as soon as

I might come
I will set in order

Therefore
I make known
to you
that
290586	no one
290588	in
290590	[the] Spirit
of God

To one

for

not
I am

And
if
should say
290859	the
ear
Because
not
I am
an eye
not
I am
290868	of
290870	the
body
not
290874	on account of
this
not
is it
290879	of

290892	[would be] the
hearing
If
all
[were] hearing
where
290899	[would be] the
sense of smell
Now
however
290904	-
God
has arranged
290908	the
members
290912	one
each
of them
290916	in
290918	the
body
as
He desired
If
now
were
290926	-
all
290929	one
member
where
290933	[would be] the

Now
however
many
even
[are the] members

however

Not
is able
now

But
290973	much
rather
290976	those
290978	seeming
290980	members
290982	of the
body
weaker
to be
indispensable
are
and
those which
we think
290992	less honorable
to be
290995	of the
body
these
290999	honor
more abundant
we bestow
and
291004	the
291006	unpresentable [parts]
of us
291009	decorum
more abundant
have
291013	-
and
291016	the presentable [parts]
of us
no
need
have
But
291023	-
God
has composed
291027	the
body
to the [parts]
being deficient
291032	more abundant
having given
honor
that
not
there should be
division
291040	in
291042	the
body
but
291046	the
same
291049	for
one another
should have concern
291053	the
members
And
if

You
now
are
291080	[the] body
of Christ
and
291084	members
291086	in
particular
And
some
indeed
has appointed

God
291096	in
291098	the
church

And
291153	now
291155	according to
a more surpassing
way
to you
I show
If
291162	in the
291164	tongues

so as

And
if
I may give away
291223	all
291225	the
possessions
of me

291285	in the
truth
All things

291296	-
Love
never

if
however
[there are] prophesies
they will be done away
if

they will be ceased
if

291311	In
part
for
we know
and
291317	in

we prophesy
when
however
should come
291324	the
perfect
291327	the
291329	in
part
will be done away
When
I was
a child
I was speaking
291337	like
a child
I was thinking
291341	like
a child
I was reasoning
291345	like
a child
when
I became
a man
I did away with
291352	the things
291354	of the
child
We see
for
presently
291360	through
a glass
291363	in
obscurity
then
however
face
291369	to
face
presently
I know
291374	in
part
then
however
I will know fully
as
also
I have been fully known
Now
however
abide
faith
hope
love
291390	the things
three
these
[the] greatest
however
of these [is]
291397	-
love
Earnestly pursue
291401	-
love
earnestly desire
now
291406	-
spiritual gifts
especially
now
that
you might prophesy
The [one]
for
speaking
in a tongue
not
to men
speaks
but
to God
no one
for
hears
in the Spirit
however
he utters
mysteries
The [one]
however
prophesying
to men
speaks [for]
edification
and
encouragement
and
consolation
The [one]
speaking
in a tongue
himself
edifies
the [one]
however
prophesying
[the] church
edifies
I desire
now
291451	all
you
to speak
in tongues
rather
however
that
you should prophesy
greater [is]
now
the [one]
prophesying
than
the [one]
speaking
in tongues
except
if
not
he should interpret
so that
291473	the
church
edification
might receive
Now
however
brothers
if
I should come
291483	to
you
in tongues
speaking
what
you
will I profit
if
not
to you
I should speak
either
291496	in
revelation
or
291500	in
knowledge
or
291504	in
prophecy
or
teaching
Even
291510	-
291512	lifeless things
a sound
giving
whether
flute
or
harp
if
distinction
291522	to the
sounds
not
they give
how
will it be known
what [is]
being piped
or
-
being harped
291534	Also
for
if
291538	indistinct
[the] trumpet
sound
gives
who
will prepare himself
291545	for
battle
So
291549	also
you
291552	with
291554	the
tongue
if
not
291559	intelligible
speech
you give
how
will it be known
what [is]
being spoken
291567	You will be
for
291570	into
[the] air
speaking
291574	So many
if
it may be
291578	kinds
of languages
there are
291582	in
[the] world
and
none
without meaning
If
therefore
not
I know
291592	the
291594	power
291596	of the
sound
I will be
to the [one]
speaking
a foreigner
and
the [one]
speaking
291606	to
me
a foreigner
So
291611	also
you
since
291615	zealous
you are
of spiritual gifts
291619	for
291621	the
291623	edification
291625	of the
church
search
that
you should cause [it] to abound
Therefore
the [one]
speaking
in a tongue
let him pray
that
he might interpret
If
for
I pray
in a tongue
291642	the
291644	spirit
of me
prays
291648	-
but
291651	the mind
of me
unfruitful
is
What
then
is it
I will pray
291660	with the
spirit
I will pray
however
291665	also
291667	with the
mind
I will sing praise
291671	with the
spirit
I will sing praise
however
291676	also
291678	with the
mind
Otherwise
if
you bless
spirit
the [one]
filling
291687	the
291689	place
291691	of the
uninstructed
how
will he say
291696	the
Amen
291699	at
291701	-
291703	your
thanksgiving
since
what
you say
not
he knows
You
truly
for
well
are giving thanks
but
291717	the
other
not
is edified
I thank
291723	-
God
291726	than all
of you
more
in tongues
speaking
but
291733	in
[the] church
I desire
291737	five
words
291740	with
291742	[the] mind
of me
to speak
that
291747	also
others
I might instruct
rather than
291752	ten thousand
words
291755	in
a tongue
Brothers
not
children
be
291762	in the
minds
Yet
291766	in the
evil
be little children
291770	in the
however
thinking
full grown
be
291776	In
291778	the
law
it has been written
-
291783	By
other tongues
and
291787	by
291789	lips
other
I will speak
291794	to the
people
this
and
not even
thus
will they hear
Me
says
[the] Lord
So then
291806	-
tongues
291809	for
a sign
are
not
to those
believing
but
291817	to the
unbelieving
291820	-
but
prophecy
[is] not
291825	to the
unbelieving
but
to the
believing
If
therefore
gathers
291835	the
church
whole
291839	together
291841	the
place
and
all
should speak
in tongues
come in
however
uninstructed ones
or
unbelievers
not
will they say
that
you are mad
If
however
all
prophesy
should come in
then
291863	some
unbeliever
or
uninstructed
he is convicted
291869	by
all
he is examined
291873	by
all
291876	the
291878	secrets
291880	of the
291882	heart
of him
manifest
become
And
thus
having fallen
291890	upon
[his] face
he will worship
291894	-
God
declaring
that
certainly
291900	-
God
291903	among
you
is
What
then
is it
brothers
When
you may come together
each
a psalm
has
a teaching
has
a revelation
has
a tongue
has
an interpretation
has
All things
291925	for
edification
let be done
If
with a tongue
anyone
speaks
291933	[let it be] by
two
or
291937	the
most
three
and
291942	in
turn
and
one
let interpret
If
however
not
there is
an interpreter
let him be silent
291954	in
[the] church
to himself
then
let him speak
and
291961	-
to God
291964	Prophets
then
two
or
three
let speak
and
291972	the
others
let discern
If
however
291978	to another
a revelation should be made
sitting by
291982	the
first
let be silent
You are able
for
291988	[one] by
one
all
to prophesy
so that
all
may learn
and
all
may be exhorted
And
292000	spirits
of prophets
to prophets
are subject
Not
for
He is
of disorder
292009	the
God
but
of peace
As
292015	in
292017	all
292019	the
292021	churches
292023	of the
saints
292026	the
women
292029	in
292031	the
churches
let them be silent
Not
for
it is allowed
to them
to speak
but
to be in submission
as
292043	also
292045	the
law
says
If
however
anything
to learn
they desire
292054	at
home
292057	the
292059	own
husbands
let them ask
shameful
for
it is
for a woman
to speak
292068	in
[the] church
Or
292072	from
you
292075	the
292077	word
292079	-
of God
has gone out
Or
292084	to
you
only
has it come
If
anyone
considers
a prophet
himself to be
or
spiritual
let him recognize
the things
I write
to you
that
292101	of [the] Lord
are
[the] commands
If
however
anyone
is ignorant
let him be ignored
So
292111	brothers
of me
earnestly desire
-
to prophesy
and
-
to speak
not
do forbid
in tongues
All things
however
properly
and
292127	with
order
let be done
I make known
now
to you
brothers
292135	the
gospel
that
I proclaimed
to you
which
also
you received
292144	in
which
also
you stand
292149	by
which
also
you are being saved
292154	to the
word
I proclaimed
to you
if
you hold fast
unless
if
not
in vain
you have believed
I delivered
for
to you
292169	in
the foremost
what
also
I received
that
Christ
died
292178	for
292180	the
292182	sins
of us
292185	according to
292187	the
Scriptures
and
that
He was buried
and
that
He was raised
292196	the
292198	day
292200	the
third
292203	according to
292205	the
Scriptures
and
that
He appeared
to Cephas
then
292213	to the
Twelve
Thereafter
He appeared
292218	to more than
292220	five hundred
brothers
at once
292224	of
whom
292227	the
greater part
remain
292231	until
now
some
however
have fallen asleep
Then
He appeared
to James
then
292241	to the
292243	apostles
all
292246	Last
then
of all
as
292251	the
untimely birth
He appeared
also to me
I
for
am
292259	the
292261	least
292263	of the
apostles
who
not
am
fit
to be called
an apostle
because
I persecuted
292274	the
292276	church
292278	-
of God
292281	[By the] grace
however
of God
I am
what
I am
and
292289	the
292291	grace
of Him
292294	-
292296	toward
me
not
void
has been
Rather
more abundantly
292304	than them
all
I toiled
not
I
however
but
292312	the
292315	grace
292317	-
of God
292320	with
me
Whether
therefore
I
or
they
thus
we preach
and
thus
you believed
If
now
Christ
is preached
that
292338	out from
[the] dead
He has been raised
how
say
292345	among
you
some
that
292350	a resurrection
of [the] dead
not
there is
If
however
292357	a resurrection
of [the] dead
not
there is
neither
Christ
has been raised
if
then
Christ
not
has been raised
[is] void
then
292372	the
292374	preaching
of us
void
292378	also
292380	the
292382	faith
of you
We are found
then
292387	also
292389	false witnesses
292391	-
of God
because
we have witnessed
292396	concerning
292398	-
God
that
He raised up
292403	-
Christ
whom
not
He has raised
if
then
[the] dead
not
are raised
If
for
[the] dead
not
are raised
neither
Christ
has been raised
if
then
Christ
not
has been raised
futile
292428	the
292430	faith
of you
still
you are
292435	in
292437	the
292439	sins
of you
Then
292443	also
those
having fallen asleep
292447	in
Christ
have perished
If
292452	in
292455	the
life
this
292459	in
Christ
292462	having hope
we are
only
more to be pitied
292467	than all
men
we are
Now
however
Christ
has been raised
292475	out from
[the] dead
292478	firstfruit
of those
having fallen asleep
Since
for
292484	by
a man [came]
death
292488	also
292490	by
a man
292493	resurrection
of [the] dead
For as
indeed
292498	in
292500	-
Adam
all
die
so
292506	also
292508	in
292510	-
Christ
all
will be made alive
Each
however
292517	in
292519	the
292521	own
order
[the] firstfruit
Christ
then
292527	those
292529	of
Christ
292532	at
292534	the
292536	coming
of Him
then
292540	the
end
when
He shall hand over
292545	the
kingdom
292548	to the
God
and
Father
when
He shall have annulled
292555	all
dominion
and
292559	all
authority
and
power
It behooves
for
Him
to reign
292568	until
that
He shall have put
292572	all
292574	the
enemies
292577	under
292579	the
292581	feet
of Him
292584	[The] last
enemy
to be abolished [is]
292588	-
death
All things
for
He has put in subjection
292594	under
292596	the
292598	feet
of Him
When
however
it may be said
that
all things
have been put in subjection
[it is] evident
that
292609	[is] excepted
the [One]
having put in subjection
to Him
292614	-
all things
When
now
shall have been put in subjection
to Him
292621	-
all things
then
292625	also
292627	Himself
292629	the
Son
will be put in subjection
to the [One]
having put in subjection
to Him
292636	-
all things
so that
may be
292641	-
God
all
292645	in
all
Otherwise
what
will they do
who
are baptized
292653	for
292655	the
dead
If
at all
[the] dead
not
are raised
why
also
are they baptized
292666	for
them
Why
292670	also
we
are in danger
292674	every
hour
292677	Every
day
I die
292681	as surely as
292683	the
292685	in you
boasting
brothers
which
I have
292691	in
Christ
Jesus
292695	the
292697	Lord
of us
If
292701	according to
man
I fought wild beasts
292705	in
Ephesus
what
to me
292710	the
profit
If
[the] dead
not
are raised
Let us eat
and
let us drink
tomorrow
for
we die
Not
be misled
Do corrupt
292726	morals
good
292729	companionships
bad
Sober up
righteously
and
not
sin
292737	ignorance
for
of God
some
have
292743	to
[the] shame
of you
I speak
But
will say
someone
How
are raised
292753	the
dead
292756	With what
then
body
do they come
Fool
you
What
you sow
not
does come to life
if
not
it dies
And
what
you sow
not
292774	the
body
that
will be
you sow
but
292781	a bare
grain
if
it may be
of wheat
or
292788	of some
292790	of the
rest
292793	-
But
God
gives
it
a body
as
He has willed
and
292803	to each
292805	of the
seeds
292808	its own
body
Not
292812	all
flesh [is]
292815	the
292817	same
flesh
but
one
indeed
of men
another
now
292826	flesh
of beasts
another
now
292831	flesh
of birds
another
now
of fish
And
292838	bodies [there are]
heavenly
and
292842	bodies
earthly
But
one
truly
292848	[is] the
292851	of the
heavenly
glory
another
now
292857	that
292859	of the
earthly
One [is]
292863	[the] glory
of [the] sun
and
another
292868	[the] glory
of [the] moon
and
another
292873	[the] glory
of [the] stars
star
for
from star
differs
292880	in
glory
So
292884	also [is]
292886	the
292888	resurrection
292890	of the
dead
It is sown
292894	in
decay
it is raised
292898	in
immortality
It is sown
292902	in
dishonor
it is raised
292906	in
glory
It is sown
292910	in
weakness
it is raised
292914	in
power
It is sown
292918	a body
natural
it is raised
292922	a body
spiritual
If
there is
292927	a body
natural
there is
292931	also
spiritual
So
also
it has been written
Became
292938	the
292940	first
man
Adam
292944	into
292946	a soul
living
292949	the
292951	last
Adam
292954	into
292956	a spirit
life-giving
However
not
first [was]
292962	the
spiritual
but
292966	the
natural
then
292970	the
spiritual
292973	The
292975	first
man
292978	[was] from
[the] earth
made of dust
292982	the
292984	second
man
292987	from
heaven
As
292991	the [one]
made of dust
so
292995	also [are]
292997	those
of the earth
and
as
293002	the
heavenly [one]
so
293006	also
293008	those
of heaven
And
as
we have born
293014	the
293016	image
293018	of the
earthly
we shall bear
293022	also
293024	the
293026	image
293028	of the
heavenly
This
now
I say
brothers
that
flesh
and
blood
293039	[the] kingdom
of God
to inherit
not
is able
nor
293046	the
decay
293049	the
immortality
does inherit
Behold
a mystery
to you
I tell
All
not
we will sleep
all
however
we will be changed
293063	in
an instant
293066	in
293068	[the] twinkling
of an eye
293071	at
293073	the
293075	last
trumpet
The trumpet will sound
for
and
293081	the
dead
will be raised
imperishable
and
we
will be changed
It behooves
for
293092	the
perishable
this
to put on
imperishable
and
293100	the
mortal
this
to put on
immortality
When
now
293109	the
perishable
this
shall have put on
imperishable
and
293117	the
mortal
this
shall have put on
immortality
then
will come to pass
293125	the
word
-
having been written
Has been swallowed up
293131	-
death
293134	in
victory
Where
293138	of you
O death
293141	the
victory
Where
293145	of you
O death
293148	the
sting
293151	-
And
293154	the sting
293156	-
of death [is]
293159	-
sin
293162	-
and
293165	the power
293167	-
of sin
293170	the
law
293173	to
however
God
[be] thanks
the [One]
giving
us
293181	the
victory
293184	through
293186	the
293188	Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
Therefore
293195	brothers
of me
beloved
293199	steadfast
be
immovable
abounding
293204	in
293206	the
293208	work
293210	of the
Lord
always
knowing
that
293216	the
293218	toil
of you
not
is
in vain
293224	in
[the] Lord
293227	Concerning
now
293230	the
collection
293233	which [is]
293235	for
293237	the
saints
as
I have directed
293242	the
293244	churches
293246	-
of Galatia
so
293250	also
you
are to do
293254	Every
293256	first
of the week
293259	each
of you
293262	aside
him
let put
treasuring up
-
what
if
he may be prospered in
so that
not
when
I might come
then
collections

however
we are constricted
293793	[it is] for
293795	-
293797	your
comfort
and
salvation
if
we are encouraged
293804	[it is] for
293806	-
293808	your
comfort
-
operating
293813	in
293815	[the] endurance
293817	of the
293819	same
sufferings
that
293823	also
we
suffer
And
293828	the
293830	hope

[is] steadfast
293834	for
you
knowing
that
as
293840	partners
you are
293843	of the
sufferings
so
293847	also
293849	of the
comfort
Not
for
do we want
you
to be ignorant
brothers
293858	as to
293860	the
293862	affliction
of us
-
having happened
293867	in
293869	-
Asia
that
293873	against
excessively
293876	beyond [our]
power
we were weighed
so as
to despair
for us
293883	even
-
to live
But
we
293889	in
ourselves
293892	the
293894	sentence
293896	-
of death
had
in order that
not
293902	trusting
we should be
293905	in
ourselves
but
293909	in
293911	-
God
the [One]
raising
293916	the
dead
who
293920	from
293922	such a great
a death
has delivered
us
and
will deliver [us]
293929	in
whom
we have hope
that
293934	also
still
He will deliver [us]
joining together
293939	also
of you
293942	for
us
293945	by
supplication
so that
293949	by
293951	many
persons
293954	for the
293957	toward
us
grace bestowed
293961	through
many
thanks may be given
293965	for
us
293969	-
For
293972	the boasting
of us
this
is
293977	the
293979	testimony
293981	of the
293983	conscience
of us
that
293987	in
293989	[the] holiness
and
sincerity
293993	-
of God
not
293997	in
293999	wisdom
fleshly
but
294003	in
294005	[the] grace
of God
we have conducted ourselves
294009	in
294011	the
world
more abundantly
now
294016	toward
you
No
for
other things
we write
to you
other
than
what
you read
or
even
understand
I hope
now
that
294034	to [the]
end
you will understand
as
also
you have understood
us
294042	in
part
so that
294046	boasting
of you
we are
even as
294051	also
you [are]
ours
294055	in
294057	the
294059	day
294061	of the
294063	Lord
of us
Jesus
And
294068	with this
294070	-
confidence
I was planning
previously
294075	to
you
to come
so that
294080	a second
blessing of grace
you might have
and
294085	through
you
to pass through
294089	into
Macedonia
and
again
294094	from
Macedonia
to come
294098	to
you
and
294102	by
you
to be set forward
294106	to
294108	-
Judea
Thus
therefore
purposing
not
then
294116	-
lightness
did I use
Or
what
I purpose
294123	according to
flesh
do I purpose
so that
there should be
294129	with
me
294132	-
Yes
yes
and
294137	-
No
no
Faithful
however
294143	-
God [is]
that
294147	the
294149	word
of us
294152	-
294154	to
you
not
was
Yes
and
No
294162	The
294165	-
of God
for
Son
Christ
Jesus
the [One]
294173	among
you
294176	by
us
having been proclaimed
294180	by
me
and
Silvanus
and
Timothy
not
was
Yes
and
No
but
Yes
294194	in
Him
it has always been
294198	As many as
for
294201	promises
of God [there are]
294204	in
Him
294207	[is] the
Yes
Therefore
294211	also
294213	in
Him
294216	the
Amen
294219	-
to God
294222	[is] for
glory
294225	by
us
The [One]
now
establishing
us
294232	with
you
294235	unto
Christ
and
having anointed
us
[is] God
the [One]
also
having sealed
us
and
having given
294248	the
294250	pledge
294252	of the
Spirit
294255	in
294257	the
294259	hearts
of us
I
however
as witness
294265	-
God
call
294269	upon
294271	-
294273	my
soul
that
sparing
you
not yet
have I come
294281	to
Corinth
Not
that
we lord it over
294287	your
294289	-
faith
but
fellow workers
are
294295	of the
294297	joy
with you
294300	in the
for
faith
you stand firm
I judged
for
within myself
this
-
294310	not
again
294313	in
grief
294316	to
you
to come
If
for
I
grieve
you
294325	again
who
-
is gladdening
me
if
not
the [one]
being grieved
294335	by
me
And
I wrote
294340	this
same thing
so that
not
having come
grief
I might have
294348	from [those]
of whom
it behooves
me
to rejoice
trusting
294355	in
294357	all
you
that
294361	-
294363	my
joy
294366	of all
of you
is
294370	Out of
for
294373	much
affliction
and
294377	anguish
of heart
I wrote
to you
294382	through
294384	many
tears
not
that
you might be grieved
but
294391	the
love
that
you might know
that
I have
more abundantly
294399	toward
you
If
however
anyone
has caused grief
not
me
has he grieved
but
294410	in
part
that
not
I might put it too severely
294416	all
you
Sufficient
294420	to
such a one
294424	[is] the
punishment
this
294428	which [is]
294430	by
294432	the
majority
so that
294436	on the contrary
rather
for you
to forgive
and
to comfort [him]
lest
perhaps
294445	-
294447	by more abundant
sorrow
should be overwhelmed
294451	-
such a one
Therefore
I exhort
you
to confirm
294458	toward
him
love
294462	For
this
indeed
also
did I write
so that
I might know
294470	the
294472	proof
of you
whether
294476	to
everything
obedient
you are
To whomever
now
anything
you forgive
I also
294486	and
for
I
to whom
I have forgiven
if
anything
I have forgiven
294495	[it is] for the sake of
you
294498	in
294500	[the] person
of Christ
so that
not
we should be outwitted
294506	by
294508	-
Satan
not
for
294513	of his
294515	-
schemes
we are ignorant
Having come
now
294521	to
294523	-
Troas
294526	for
294528	the
294530	gospel
294532	-
of Christ
also
a door
to me
having been opened
294539	in
[the] Lord
not
I had
rest
294545	in the
294547	spirit
of me
in the
not
finding
my
Titus
294555	the
294557	brother
of me
instead
having taken leave of
them
I went out
294564	to
Macedonia
294567	To
however
God
[be] thanks
the [One]
always
leading in triumph
us
294576	in
294578	-
Christ
and
294582	the
294584	fragrance
294586	of the
294588	knowledge
of Him
making manifest
294592	through
us
294595	in
294597	every
place
For
294601	of Christ
a sweet perfume
we are
294605	-
to God
294608	in
those
being saved
and
294613	in
those
perishing
to one
indeed
294619	an odor
294621	from
death
294624	to
death
to one
now
294629	a fragrance
294631	from
life
294634	to
life
And
294638	for
these things
who [is]
sufficient
Not
for
294645	we are
like
294648	the
many
peddling
294652	the
294654	word
294656	-
of God
but
as
294661	of
sincerity
but
as
294666	of
God
294669	before
God
294672	in
Christ
we speak
Are we beginning
again
ourselves
to commend
Or
not
we need
294683	like
some
294686	commendatory
letters
294689	to
you
or
294693	from
you
294696	The
294698	letter
of us
you
are
having been inscribed
294704	in
294706	the
294708	hearts
of us
being known
and
being read
294714	by
294716	all
men
being revealed
that
you are
294722	a letter
of Christ
having been ministered to
294726	by
us
having been inscribed
not
in ink
but
294733	with [the] Spirit
294735	of God
[the] living
not
294739	on
294741	tablets
of stone
but
294745	on
tablets
294748	of hearts
human
294751	Confidence
now
such
we have
294756	through
294758	-
Christ
294761	toward
294763	-
God
Not
that
294768	from
ourselves
sufficient
we are
to reckon
anything
294775	as
294777	of
ourselves
but
294781	the
294783	sufficiency
of us
294786	[is] of
294788	-
God
who
also
has made competent
us [as]
294795	ministers
294797	of a new
294799	covenant
not
of [the] letter
but
of [the] Spirit
294805	the
for
letter
kills
294810	-
but
the Spirit
gives life
If
now
294817	the
294819	ministry
294821	-
of death
294824	in
letters
having been engraved
on stones
was produced
294830	in
glory
so as for
not
to be able
to look intently
294837	the
294839	sons
of Israel
294842	into
294844	the
294846	face
of Moses
294849	on account of
294851	the
294853	glory
294855	of the
294857	face
of him
which
is fading
how
294863	not
more
294866	the
294868	ministry
294870	of the
Spirit
will be
294874	in
glory
If
for
294879	in the
294881	ministry
294883	-
of condemnation [was]
glory
294887	much
more
abounds
294891	the
294893	ministry
294895	-
of righteousness
[in] glory
Even
for
not
has been glorified
that
having been made glorious
294905	in
294907	this
294909	-
respect
294912	on account of
294914	the
294916	surpassing [it]
glory
If
for
that which
is fading away
294923	[was] through
glory
294926	much
more [is]
that
remaining
294931	in
glory
Having
therefore
294936	such
hope
294939	great
boldness
we use
and
not
as
Moses
would put
a veil
294949	over
294951	the
294953	face
of himself
294956	for
-
not
to look intently
294961	the
294963	sons
of Israel
294966	into
294968	the
294970	end
of that
fading away
But
were hardened
294976	the
294978	minds
of them
294981	Until
for
294984	the
294986	present
day
294989	the
294991	same
veil
294994	at
294996	the
294998	reading
295000	of the
295002	old
covenant
remains
not
being lifted
which
295009	in
Christ
is being removed
But
295014	unto
this day
when
-
shall be read
Moses
a veil
295022	over
295024	the
295026	heart
of them
lies
Whenever
however
if
[one] shall have turned
295034	to
[the] Lord
is taken away
295038	the
veil
295041	The
now
Lord
295045	the
Spirit
is
where
now
295051	the
295053	Spirit
of [the] Lord [is]
[there is] freedom
295057	We
now
all
295061	having been unveiled
in face
295064	the
295066	glory
of [the] Lord
beholding as in a mirror
295070	the
295072	same
image
are being transformed into
295076	from
glory
295079	to
glory
even as
295083	from
295085	[the] Lord
[the] Spirit
295088	Because of
this
having
295093	the
ministry
this
as
we received mercy
not
we lose heart
But
we have renounced
295103	the
295105	hidden things
295107	-
of shame
not
walking
295112	in
craftiness
nor
falsifying
295117	the
295119	word
295121	-
of God
but
295125	-
295127	by manifestation
295129	of the
truth
commending
ourselves
295134	to
295136	every
295138	conscience
of men
295141	before
295143	-
God
If
however
indeed
295149	is
concealed
295152	the
295154	gospel
of us
295157	to
those who
are perishing
295161	it is
concealed
295164	in
whom
295167	the
295169	god
295172	of the
age
this
has blinded
295177	the
295179	minds
295181	of the
unbelieving
295184	so as for
-
not
to beam forth
295189	the
295191	illumination
295193	of the
295195	gospel
295197	of the
295199	glory
295201	-
of Christ
who
is
295206	[the] image
295208	-
of God
Not
for
ourselves
do we proclaim
but
Christ
Jesus
Lord
ourselves
now
295221	servants
of you
295224	for the sake of
Jesus
For [it is]
295228	-
God
-
having said
295233	Out of
darkness
light
shall shine
who
shone
295240	in
295242	the
295244	hearts
of us
295247	for [the]
295249	radiance
295251	of the
295253	knowledge
295255	of the
295257	glory
295259	-
of God
295262	in
295264	[the] face
Christ
We have
now
295270	the
treasure
this
295274	in
295276	earthen
vessels
that
295280	the
295282	surpassingness
295284	of the
power
may be
295288	-
from God
and
not
295293	from
us
295296	in
every [way]
being hard pressed
but
not
being crushed
being perplexed
but
not
despairing
being persecuted
but
not
being forsaken
being struck down
but
not
being destroyed
always
295316	the
295318	death
295320	-
[of] Jesus
295323	in
295325	[our]
body
carrying around
so that
295330	also
295332	the
295334	life
295336	-
of Jesus
295339	in
295341	the
295343	body
of us
should be manifested
always
for
we
the
living
295352	to
death
are being delivered
295356	on account of
Jesus
so that
295360	also
295362	the
295364	life
295366	-
of Jesus
may be manifested
295370	in
295372	the
295374	mortal
295376	flesh
of us
So then
295380	-
death
295383	in
us
works
295387	-
but
life
295391	in
you
Having
however
295396	the
295398	same
295400	spirit
295402	-
of faith
295405	according to
that
having been written
I believed
therefore
I have spoken
295412	also
we
believe
therefore
also
speak
knowing
that
the [One]
having raised up
295423	the
Lord
Jesus
295427	also
us
295430	through
Jesus
will raise up
and
will present [us]
295436	with
you
295439	-
For
all things [are]
295443	for the sake of
you
so that
295447	the
grace
having abounded
295451	through
295453	-
more and more
295456	the
thanksgiving
may increase
295460	to
295462	the
295464	glory
295466	-
of God
Therefore
not
we lose heart
but
if
295474	indeed
295476	the
295478	outward
295480	of us
man
is being brought to decay
yet
295485	the
295487	inner
of us
is being renewed
day
and
day
295494	The
for
295497	momentary
295499	lightness
295501	-
affliction
295504	far
surpassing
295507	to
excessiveness
295510	an eternal
295512	weight
of glory
is producing
for us
not
are looking at
we
the things
being seen
but
the things
not
being seen
The things
for
being seen [are]
temporary
the things
however
not
being seen
[are] eternal
We know
for
that
if
295539	-
295541	earthly
295543	of us
295545	house
295547	the
tent
should be destroyed
a building
295552	from
God
we have
295557	a house
not made with hands
eternal
295561	in
295563	the
heavens
295566	And
indeed
295569	in
this
we groan
295573	the
295575	dwelling
of us
295578	which [is]
295580	from
heaven
to be clothed with
longing
If
indeed
also
having been clothed
not
naked
we will be found
295592	And
for
-
being
295597	in
295599	the
tent
we groan
being burdened
295604	because
that
not
we do wish
to be unclothed
but
to be clothed
that
may be swallowed up
295614	the
mortal
295617	by
295619	-
life
The [One]
now
having prepared
us
295626	for
295628	very
this
[is] God
-
having given
to us
295635	the
295637	pledge
295639	of the
Spirit
being confident
therefore
always
and
knowing
that
being at home
295649	in
295651	the
body
we are absent
295655	from
295657	the
Lord
295660	by
faith
for
we walk
295665	not
295667	by
sight
We are confident
now
and
are pleased
rather
to be absent
295676	out of
295678	the
body
and
to be at home
295683	with
295685	the
Lord
Therefore
also
we are ambitious
whether
being at home
or
being away
well-pleasing
to Him
to be
295698	-
For
all
of us
to be revealed
it behooves
295705	before
295707	the
295709	judgment seat
295711	-
of Christ
that
may receive back
each
295717	the things [done]
295719	in
295721	the
body
295724	according to
what
he did
whether
good
or
evil
Knowing
therefore
295734	the
295736	fear
295738	of the
Lord
men
we persuade
to God
and
we have been made manifest
I hope
now
295748	also
295750	in
295752	the
295754	consciences
of you
to have been made manifest
Not
again
ourselves
are we commending
to you
but
295764	occasion
are giving
to you
of boasting
295769	on behalf of
us
so that
you may have [an answer]
295774	toward
those
295777	in
appearance
boasting
and
not
295783	in
[the] heart
If
for
we are beside ourselves
[it is] to God
or if
we are sober-minded
[it is] for you
295793	The
for
295796	love
295798	-
of Christ
compels
us
having concluded
this
that
One
295807	for
all
has died
therefore
295812	-
all
have died
And
295817	for
all
He died
that
those
living
no longer
to themselves
should live
but
to the [One]
295829	for
them
having died
and
having been raised again
Therefore
we
295837	from
295839	-
now
no one
regard
295844	according to
[the] flesh
Though
even
we have regarded
295850	according to
flesh
Christ
yet
now
no longer
we regard [Him thus]
Therefore
if
anyone
295861	[is] in
Christ
295864	[he is] a new
creation
295867	The
old things
have passed away
behold
has come into being
[the] new
295874	-
And
all things
295878	[are] of
295880	-
God
the [One]
having reconciled
us
to Himself
295887	through
Christ
and
having given
to us
295893	the
295895	ministry
295897	-
of reconciliation
how
that
God
295903	was
295905	in
Christ
[the] world
reconciling
to Himself
not
reckoning
to them
295914	the
295916	trespasses
of them
and
having put
295921	into
us
295924	the
295926	word
295928	-
of reconciliation
295931	For
Christ
therefore
we are ambassadors
as though
295937	-
God
is beseeching
295941	through
us
We implore
295945	on behalf
of Christ
Be reconciled
295949	-
to God
The [One]
not
having known
sin
295956	for
us
sin
He made
so that
we
might become
295964	[the] righteousness
of God
295967	in
Him
Working together
now
also
we exhort
not
295975	in
vain
295978	the
295980	grace
295982	-
of God
to receive
you
He says
for
295989	In a time
acceptable
I listened to
you
and
295995	in
295997	a day
of salvation
I helped
you
Behold
now
296004	[is the] time
of favor
behold
now
296009	[is the] day
of salvation
296012	Nothing
296014	before
no one
placing
an obstacle
so that
not
should be blemished
296022	the
ministry
rather
296026	in
everything
we are commending
ourselves
296031	as
296033	Godâs
servants
296036	in
296038	endurance

296106	-
296108	of righteousness
296110	for the
right hand
and
for [the] left
296115	through
glory
and

296120	through
bad report
and
good report
as

as

296189	-
Now
296192	[as] the same
recompense
as
to children
I speak
be expanded
296199	also
you
Not
296203	become
unequally yoked together
with unbelievers
what
for
partnership [have]
righteousness
and
lawlessness
Or

What

has said

God

I will dwell
296259	in
them

will walk among [them]
and
I will be
296266	their
God
and
they
will be
296272	to Me
a people
Therefore
come out
296277	from
296279	the midst
of them
and
be separate
says
[the] Lord
and
unclean
nothing

and I
will receive
you
and
I will be
to you
296296	for
a father

you
will be

daughters
says
[the] Lord
Almighty
296311	These
therefore
having
296315	-

we have corrupted
no one
we have exploited
296345	For
condemnation
not
I speak
I have before said
for
that
296353	in
296355	the
296357	hearts
of us
you are
296361	for [us]
-
to die together
and
to live together
Great [is]
my
boldness
296370	toward
you
great
my
boasting
296376	on behalf of
you
I have been filled
296380	-
with encouragement
I overabound
296384	-
with joy
296387	upon
296389	all
296391	the
296393	affliction
of us
And
for
having come
of us
296400	into
Macedonia
no
had
rest
296406	the
296408	flesh
of us
but
296412	in
every [way]
we are being pressed
on the outside
conflicts
within
fears
But
the [One]
comforting
296423	the
downcast
comforted
us
296428	-
God
296431	by
296433	the
296435	coming
of Titus
not
296439	only
now
296442	by
296444	the
296446	coming
of him
but
296450	also
296452	by
296454	the
comfort
with which
he was comforted
296459	as to
you
relating
to us
296464	-
296466	your
earnest desire
296469	-
296471	your
mourning
296474	-
296476	your
296478	zeal
296480	for
me
so as
for me
the more
to rejoice
For
if
also
I have grieved
you
296492	in
296494	the
letter
not
I do regret [it]
Though
even
I did regret [it]
I see
that
296505	the
letter
that
if
even
296511	for
an hour
grieved
you
Now
I rejoice
not
that
you were grieved
but
that
you were grieved
296524	unto
repentance
you were grieved
for
296529	according to
God
so that
296533	in
nothing
you might suffer loss
296537	through
us
296540	The
for
296544	according to
God
grief
296549	repentance
296551	to
salvation
without regret
produces
296556	-
and
296560	the of the
world
grief
death
produces
Behold
for
296568	this very
same
thing
296572	according to
God
to have been grieved
296576	how much
has produced
in you
earnestness
but instead
reasoned defense
but
indignation
but
fear
but
longing
but
zeal
but
vindication
296593	In
everything
you have proved
yourselves
innocent
to be
296600	in this
matter
So
if
even
I wrote
to you
[it was] not
296609	for the sake of
the [one]
having done wrong
nor
296614	for the sake of
the [one]
having suffered wrong
but rather
296619	for the sake of
-
being revealed
296623	the
296625	earnestness
of you
296628	which [is]
296630	for
us
296633	to
you
296636	before
296638	-
God
296641	On account of
this
we have been comforted
296645	Besides
now
296648	the
296650	comfort
of us
296653	the more abundantly
rather
we have rejoiced
296657	at
296659	the
296661	joy
of Titus
because
has been refreshed
296666	the
296668	spirit
of him
296671	by
296673	all
of you
For
if
anything
to him
296680	about
you
I have boasted
not
I was put to shame
but
as
all things
296689	in
truth
we have spoken
to you
so
296695	also
296697	the
296700	boasting
of us
296703	to
Titus
truth
became
And
296709	the
296711	affections
of him
more abundantly
296715	toward
you
are
remembering
296720	the
296723	of all
of you
obedience
how
296728	with
fear
and
trembling
you received
him
I rejoice
that
296737	in
everything
I am confident
296741	in
you
We make known
now
to you
brothers
296748	the
296750	grace
296752	-
of God
-
having been bestowed
296757	among
296759	the
296761	churches
296763	-
of Macedonia
that
296767	in
296769	much
296771	proof
of tribulation
296774	the
296776	abundance
296778	of the
296780	joy
of them
and
296784	-
296787	of
deep
296790	poverty
of them
abounded
296794	into
296796	the
296798	riches
296800	the
296802	generosity
of them
For
296806	according to
[their] ability
I testify [that]
and
296811	beyond
[their] ability
[they were] willing of themselves
296815	with
296817	much
entreaty
imploring
of us
296822	for the
grace
and
296826	the
296828	fellowship
296830	of the
service
296833	-
296835	among
296837	the
saints
And
not [only]
as
we had hoped
but
themselves
they gave
296847	first
296849	to the
Lord
and then
to us
296854	by [the]
296856	will
of God
296859	Accordingly
-
exhorted
we
Titus
that
as
he had begun
so
also
he might complete
296871	with
you
296874	as well
296877	the
grace
this
But
even as
296883	in
every [way]
you abound
in faith
and
speech
and
knowledge
and
296893	all
earnestness
and
296897	in the
296900	from
us
296903	to
you
love
that
296908	also
296910	in
296912	this
296914	-
grace
you should abound
Not
296919	as
a command
do I speak
but
296924	through
296926	the
296928	of others
earnestness
296931	also
296933	the
296936	-
296938	of your
love
genuineness
proving
You know
for
296945	the
296947	grace
296949	of the
296951	Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
that
296957	for the sake of
you
He became poor
rich
being
so that
you
296965	-
296967	through that
poverty
might be enriched
And
a judgment
296973	in
this [matter]
I give
this
indeed
for you
is profitable
who
not
296983	only
-
to act
but
296988	also
-
to will
have begun
296993	from
a year ago
Now
then
296998	also
the
doing
complete
so that
just as
297005	[there was] the
297007	readiness
of the
to will
so
297012	also
the
to complete
297016	out of
that which
you have
If
for
297022	the
readiness
is present
as
if
he might have
acceptable
not
as
not
he does have
Not
for
that
to others [there may be]
ease
but for you
affliction
but
297042	of
equality
297045	At
297047	the
297049	present
time
297052	-
297054	your
abundance
297057	[will be] for
297059	the
297061	of those
need
so that
297065	also
297067	-
297069	their
abundance
may be
297073	for
297075	the
297077	of you
need
so that
there may be
equality
As
it has been written
He
297086	the
much
not
did abound
and
he
297093	the
little
not
had lack
Thanks
however
297100	-
to God
the [One]
putting
297105	the
297107	same
earnestness
297110	for
you
297113	into
297115	the
297117	heart
of Titus
For
297121	[our]
indeed
appeal
he accepted
very earnest
however
being
of his own accord
he has gone out
297131	to
you
We have sent
now
297136	with
him
297139	the
brother
297142	whose
297144	-
297146	praise
297148	[is] in
297150	the
gospel
297153	through
297155	all
297157	of the
churches
not
only
now
but
also
having been chosen
297166	by
297168	the
churches
297171	fellow traveler
of us
297174	with
297177	-
grace
this
that [is]
being administered
297183	by
us
297186	toward
297188	the
297191	himself
297193	of the
Lord
glory
and
297198	readiness
of us
avoiding
this
lest
anyone
us
should blame
297207	in
297210	the
abundance
this
-
being administered
297216	by
us
We are taking great care to do
for
what is right
not
297223	only
297225	before
[the] Lord
but
297229	also
297231	before
men
We sent with
now
them
297237	the
297239	brother
of us
whom
we have proven
297244	in
many things
often
earnest
to be
now
however
much
earnest
297254	by [his] confidence
more
297257	which [is]
297259	in
you
Whether
297263	as regards
Titus
297266	[he is] partner
my
and
297271	for
you
a fellow worker
or
297276	brothers
our
297279	[they are] apostles
of [the] churches
297282	[the] glory
of Christ
297285	-
Therefore
297288	the proof
297290	of the
297292	love
of you
and
297296	of our
297298	boasting
297300	about
you
297303	to
them
show
297307	in
297309	face
297311	of the
churches
297314	Concerning
now
for
297318	the
service
297321	-
297323	for
297325	the
saints
superfluous
for me
it is
-
to write
to you
I know
for
297336	the
297338	readiness
of you
which
297342	concerning
you
I boast of
to Macedonians
that
Achaia
has been prepared
297350	from
a year ago
and
297354	-
297356	your
zeal
has been provoking
297360	the
greater number
I have sent
however
297365	the
brothers
that
not
297370	the
297372	boasting
of us
297375	which [is]
297377	about
you
should be made void
297381	in
297384	the
matter
this
that
as
I have been saying
297391	prepared
you may be
Not
perhaps
if
should come
297398	with
me
Macedonians
and
find
you
unprepared
would be put to shame
we
that
not
we might say
you
297412	in
297415	the
confidence
this
Necessary
therefore
I esteemed [it]
to exhort
297423	the
brothers
that
they should go before
297428	unto
you
and
should complete beforehand
297433	the
297435	foreannounced
297437	blessing
of you
this
ready
to be
thus
297444	as
a blessing
and
297448	not
297450	as
covetousness
This
now
The [one]
sowing
sparingly
sparingly
also
will reap
and
the [one]
sowing
297464	upon
blessings
297467	upon
blessings
also
will reap
each
as
he purposes
297475	in the
heart
not
297479	out of
regret
or
297483	of
necessity
297486	a cheerful
for
giver
loves

God
Able [is]
now
297496	-
God
297499	all
grace
to make abound
297503	to
you
so that
297507	in
every [way]
always
297511	all
sufficiency
having
you may abound
297516	in
297518	every
297520	work
good
As
it has been written
He has scattered abroad
He has given
297527	to the
poor
297530	the
297532	righteousness
of Him

297536	to
297538	the
age
The [One]
now
supplying
seed
to him
sowing
and
bread
297549	for
food
will supply
and
will multiply
297555	the
297557	seed for sowing
of you
and
will increase
297562	the
297564	fruits
297566	of the
297568	righteousness

For
297590	the
297592	ministry
297595	of the

not
only
297601	is
completely filling up
297604	the
297606	needs
297608	of the
saints
but
also
is overflowing
297614	through
297616	many
thanksgivings
297619	-
to God

you
297716	by
297718	the
297720	meekness
and
gentleness

of Christ
who
297728	as to
appearance
indeed
[am] humble
297733	among
you
being absent
however
am bold
297739	toward
you
I implore [you]
now
that
not
being present
to be bold
297748	with the
confidence
with which
I reckon
to be daring
297754	toward
297756	some

reckoning

as

flesh
walking
297766	In
flesh
for
walking

297772	according to

297781	of the
297783	warfare
of us
[are] not
fleshly
but
powerful
297790	-
divinely
297793	to
297795	[the] demolition
of strongholds
arguments
overthrowing
and
297801	every
297803	high thing
lifting itself up
297806	against
297808	the
297810	knowledge
297812	-
of God
and
taking captive
297817	every

297820	into
297822	the
297824	obedience
297826	-

297830	in
readiness

If
anyone
is persuaded
in himself

let him reckon
again
297860	within
himself

as
he
[is] of Christ

297868	also [are]
we
If
even
for
297874	more abundantly
somewhat
I should boast
297878	concerning
297880	the
297882	authority
of us
which
has given [us]
297887	the
Lord
297890	for
building [you] up
and
297894	not
297896	for
297898	tearing down
you
not
I will be ashamed
that
not
[I] might seem
as if
-
to frighten
you
297910	by means of
297912	the
letters
For
297916	the
letters
indeed
they say
[are] weighty
and
strong
297924	-
but
297927	the presence
297929	of the
body
weak
and
297934	the
speech
having been ignored
This
let reckon
297940	-
such a one
that
such as
we are
297946	-
297948	in word
297950	by
letters
being absent
such [we are]
also
being present
297957	-
in action
Not
for
dare we
to classify
or
to compare
ourselves [with]
297967	some
-
themselves
commending
but
these
297974	by
themselves
themselves
measuring
and
comparing
themselves
with themselves
not
understand
We
however
not
297988	into
297990	the things
beyond measure
will boast
but
297995	according to
297997	the
297999	measure
298001	of the
area
that
has assigned
to us
298007	-
God
a measure
to reach
298012	as far as
298014	also
you
Not
for
as
not
reaching
298022	to
you
we are overextending
ourselves
298027	as far as
for
298030	also
you
we came
298034	in
298036	the
298038	gospel
298040	-
of Christ
not
298044	to
298046	the things
beyond measure
boasting
298050	in
298052	othersâ
labors
hope
however
having
increasing
298059	the
298061	faith
of you
298064	among
you
to be enlarged
298068	according to
298070	the
298072	area
of us
298075	to
abundance
298078	so as
298080	that
298082	beyond
you
to preach the gospel
not
298087	in
298089	anotherâs
area
298092	in
298094	things
ready
to boast
The [one]
however
boasting
298101	in
[the] Lord
let him boast
Not
for
the [one]
himself
commending
this [one]
is
approved
but
the one whom
298115	the
Lord
commends
I wish
you were bearing with
me
298122	little
298124	a
in foolishness
but
indeed
you do bear with
me
I am jealous as to
for
you
298134	of God
with [the] jealousy
I have betrothed
for
you
298140	to one
husband
298143	a virgin
pure
to present
298147	-
to Christ
I am afraid
however
lest
by any means
as
298155	the
serpent
deceived
Eve
298160	in
298162	the
298164	craftiness
of him
might be corrupted
298168	the
298170	minds
of you
298173	from
298175	the
simplicity
and
298179	the
purity
298182	-
298184	in
Christ
If
indeed
for
the [one]
coming
298192	another
Jesus
proclaims
whom
not
we did proclaim
or
298200	a spirit
different
you receive
which
not
you did receive
or
298208	glad tidings
different
which
not
you did accept
well
are you bearing with [it]
I reckon
for
in nothing
to have been inferior
298220	to those
298222	most eminent
apostles
If
however
298227	even
unpolished
298230	-
in speech [I am]
yet
not
298235	-
in knowledge
but
298239	in
every [way]
we have been made manifest
298243	in
all things
298246	to
you
Or
a sin
did I commit
myself
humbling
so that
you
might be exalted
because
freely
298259	the
298262	-
of God
gospel
I preached
to you
298268	Other
churches
I robbed
having received
support
298274	for
298276	the
298278	toward you
service
And
being present
298283	with
you
and
having been in need
not
I did burden
no one
298291	-
for
298294	the need
of me
completely filled up
298298	the
brothers
having come
298302	from
Macedonia
and
298306	in
everything
unburdensome
myself
to you
I kept
and
will keep
Is
298316	[the] truth
of Christ
298319	in
me
that
298324	the
boasting
this
not
will be sealed up
298330	of
mine
298333	in
298335	the
298337	regions
298339	-
of Achaia
298342	Because of
why
Because
not
I do love
you
298349	-
God
knows [I do]
What
however
I do
also
I will do
so that
I might cut off
298360	the
298362	opportunity
of those
desiring
an opportunity
that
298368	in
what
they are boasting
they might be found
as
298374	also
we
298377	-
For
such [are]
false apostles
298382	workers
deceitful
disguising themselves
298386	as
298388	apostles
of Christ
And
no
wonder
298394	himself
for
298397	-
Satan
masquerades
298401	as
298403	an angel
of light
[It is] not
surprising
therefore
if
298410	also
298412	the
298414	servants
of him
masquerade
298418	as
298420	servants
of righteousness
298423	whose
298425	-
end
will be
298429	according to
298431	the
298433	deeds
of them
Again
I say
no
one
me
should think
a fool
to be
if
however
otherwise
even
as
a fool
receive
me
that
I also
298454	little
a
may boast
What
I am saying
not
298461	according to
[the] Lord
am I saying
but
as
298467	in
foolishness
298470	in
298472	this
298474	the
298476	confidence
298478	-
of boasting
Since
many
boast
298484	according to
298486	the
flesh
I also
will boast
Gladly
for
you bear with
298494	-
fools
wise
being
You bear [it]
for
if
anyone
you
enslaves
if
anyone
devours [you]
if
anyone
takes [from you]
if
anyone
exalts himself
if
anyone
298516	in
[the] face
of you
strikes [you]
298521	As to
dishonor
I speak
as
that
we
have been weak
298529	In
whatever
however
-
anyone
might be daring
298536	in
foolishness
I speak
am daring
I also
Hebrews
are they
I also
Israelites
are they
I also
298548	Descendants
of Abraham
are they
I also
298553	Servants
of Christ
are they
As being beside myself
I speak
above [measure]
I [too]
298561	in
labors
more abundantly
298565	in
imprisonments
more abundantly
298569	in
beatings
above measure
298573	in
deaths
often
298577	From
[the] Jews
five times
298581	forty [lashes]
298583	minus
one
I received
Three times
I was beaten with rods
once
I was stoned
three times
I was shipwrecked
a night and a day
298594	in
298596	the
deep [sea]
I have passed
in journeyings
often
298602	in perils
of rivers
298605	in perils
of robbers
in perils
298609	from [my own]
race
in perils
298613	from
[the] Gentiles
in perils
298617	in
[the] city
in perils
298621	in
[the] wilderness
in perils
298625	on
[the] sea
in perils
298629	among
false brothers
in labor
and
toil
298635	in
watchings
often
298639	in
hunger
and
thirst
298644	in
fastings
often
298648	in
cold
and
nakedness
298653	Besides
298655	the things
external
298658	the
pressure
on me
298662	-
298664	on every
day
298667	[is my]
298669	care
298671	for all
298673	the
churches
Who
is weak
and
not
I am weak
Who
is led into sin
and
not
I
do burn inwardly
If
to boast
it behooves [me]
298690	[in] the things
298692	of the
298694	weakness
of me
I will boast
298698	The
298700	God
and
Father
298704	of the
Lord
Jesus
knows
the [One]
being
blessed
298712	to
298714	the
ages
that
not
I am lying
298720	In
Damascus
298723	the
298725	governor
under Aretas
298728	the
king
was guarding
298732	the
298734	city
of the Damascenes
to seize
me
But
298740	through
a window
298743	in
a basket
I was let down
298747	through
298749	the
wall
and
I escaped
298754	the
298756	hands
of him
To boast
it behooves [me]
not
is it profitable
indeed
I will go on
however
298766	to
298768	visions
and
revelations
of [the] Lord
I know
298774	a man
298776	in
Christ
298779	ago
298781	years
fourteen
whether
298785	in
[the] body
not
I know
or
298791	out of
298793	the
body
not
I know
298798	-
God
knows
having been caught up
298803	-
such a man
298806	to
298808	[the] third
heaven
And
I know
298813	-
298815	such
a man
whether
298819	in
[the] body
or
298823	out of
298825	the
body
not
I know
298830	-
God
knows
that
he was caught up
298836	into
298838	-
Paradise
and
he heard
298843	inexpressible
words
-
not
being permitted
to man
to speak
298851	Concerning
298853	-
such a man
I will boast
298857	concerning
however
myself
not
I will boast
if
not
298865	in
298867	the
weaknesses
If
for
I should desire
to boast
not
I will be
a fool
[the] truth
for
I will be speaking
I refrain
however
lest
anyone
298884	to
me
should credit
298888	more than
what
he sees
in me
or
hears
298895	of
me
298898	and
298900	the
298902	surpassingness
298904	of the
revelations
Therefore
that
not
I should become conceited
was given
to me
a thorn
298914	in [my]
flesh
298917	a messenger
of Satan
that
me
he might buffet
so that
not
I should become conceited
298926	For
this
three times
298930	the
Lord
I begged
that
it might depart
298936	from
me
And
He said
to me
Suffices
you
298944	the
298946	grace
of Me
298949	the
for
power
298953	in
weakness
is perfected
Most gladly
therefore
rather
will I boast
298961	in
298963	the
weaknesses
so that
may rest
298968	upon
me
298971	the
298973	power
298975	-
of Christ
Therefore
I take pleasure
298980	in
weaknesses
298983	in
insults
298986	in
hardships
298989	in
persecutions
and
difficulties
298994	for
Christ
when
for
I might be weak
then
strong
I am
I have become
a fool
you
me
compelled
I
for
ought
299011	by
you
to have been commended
In no way
for
was I inferior
299018	to those
299020	most eminent
apostles
though
299024	even
nothing
I am
299028	The
indeed
299031	signs
299033	of the
apostle
were performed
299037	among
you
299040	in
299042	all
perseverance
in signs
both
and
wonders
and
miracles
In what
for
is it
that
you were inferior
299056	beyond
299058	the
299060	rest
[of the] churches
if
not
that
299066	myself
I
not
did burden
you
Forgive
me
299075	the
wrong
this
Behold
299080	third time
this
ready
I am
to come
299086	to
you
and
not
I will burden [you]
not
for
I seek
299095	what [is]
yours
but
you
Not
for
ought
299103	the
children
299106	for the
parents
to treasure up
but
299111	the
parents
299114	for the
children
I
now
most gladly
will spend
and
will be utterly spent
299123	for
299125	the
299127	souls
of you
If
more abundantly
you
loving
less
I am loved
Be it so
however
I
not
did burden
you
but
being
crafty
by trickery
you
I caught
Not
any
of whom
I have sent
299152	to
you
299155	by
him
did I exploit
you
I urged
Titus [to go]
and
sent with [him]
299164	the
brother
Not
did exploit
you
Titus
Not
299172	in the
299174	same
spirit
did we walk
Not
299179	in the
299181	same
steps
All along
have you been thinking
that
to you
we have been making a defense
299189	Before
God
299192	in
Christ
we speak
299196	-
but
all things
beloved
299201	for
299203	-
299205	your
edification
I fear
for
lest
perhaps
having come
not
such as
I wish
I may find
you
and I
might be found
by you
such as
not
you do wish
lest
perhaps
quarreling
jealousy
anger
contentions
slander
gossip
conceit
disorder
lest
again
having come
of me
should humble
me
299240	the
299242	God
of me
299245	as to
you
and
I should mourn over
299250	many
of those
having before sinned
and
not
having repented
299257	of
299259	the
impurity
and
sexual immorality
and
sensuality
that
they have practiced
299268	Third
this [time]
I am coming
299272	to
you
299275	In [the]
299277	mouth
299279	of two
witnesses
or
three
will be established
299285	every
matter
I have warned
and
I warn
as
being present
299293	the
second time
and
being absent
now
those
having sinned before
and
299303	the
rest
all
that
if
I come
299310	to
299312	the [same]
again
not
I will spare [anyone]
since
299318	a proof
you seek
299321	-
299324	in
me
speaking
of Christ
who
299330	toward
you
not
is weak
but
is powerful
299337	among
you
And
for
He was crucified
299343	in
weakness
yet
He lives
299348	by
299350	power
Godâs
299353	Also
for
we
are weak
299358	in
Him
but
we will live
299363	with
Him
299366	by
299368	power
Godâs
299371	toward
you
Yourselves
examine
whether
you are
299378	in
299380	the
faith
yourselves
test
Or
not
do you recognize
yourselves
that
Jesus
Christ [is]
299392	in
you
if
not
unapproved
you are
I hope
now
that
you will know
that
we
not
are
unapproved
We pray
now
299410	to
299412	-
God
not
to do
you
299418	wrong
nothing
not
that
we
approved
might appear
but
that
you
299429	what [is]
right
may do
we
though
299435	as
unapproved
might appear
Nothing
for
have we power
any
299443	against
299445	the
truth
but
299449	for
299451	the
truth
We rejoice
for
when
we
might be weak
you
however
strong
might be
But this
also
We pray for
299466	the
299468	of you
perfection
299471	Because of
therefore
these things
being absent
I write
so that
being present
not
with severity
I should treat [you]
299482	according to
299484	the
authority
that
299488	the
Lord
has given
me
299493	for
building up
and
299497	not
299499	for
tearing down
Finally
brothers
rejoice
Be perfected
be exhorted
299507	[be of] the
same
mind
be at peace
And
299513	the

299517	-
of love
and

of you
Paul

not
299576	from

nor
299580	through

but
299584	through
Jesus
Christ
and
God
[the] Father
the [One]
having raised
Him
299594	out from
[the] dead
and
299598	the
299601	with
me
299604	all
brothers
299607	To the
299609	churches
299611	-
of Galatia
Grace
to you
and
peace
299618	from
God
299621	Father
of us
and
the Lord
Jesus
Christ
the [One]
having given
Himself
299631	for
299633	the
299635	sins
of us
so that
He might deliver
us
299641	out of
299644	the
age
of
having come presently
evil
299650	according to
299652	the
299654	will
299656	of the
299658	God
and
Father
of us
to whom [be]
299664	the
glory
299667	to
299669	the
299671	ages
299673	of the
ages
Amen
I am astonished
that
so
quickly
you are deserting
299682	from
the [One]
having called
you
299687	in
299689	[the] grace
of Christ
299692	to
299694	a different
gospel
which
not
is
another
if
not
some
there are
who
are troubling
you
and
are desiring
to pervert
299711	the
299713	gospel
299715	-
of Christ
But
even
if
we
or
299723	an angel
299725	out of
heaven
should preach a gospel
to you
299730	contrary to
what
we proclaimed
to you
accursed
let him be
As
we have said before
even
now
again
I say
if
anyone
[to] you
is preaching a gospel
299747	contrary to
what
you received
accursed
let him be
Presently
for
of men
do I seek approval
or
299758	-
God
Or
do I seek
men
to please
For if
yet
men
I were pleasing
299769	of Christ
a servant
not
-
I would be
I make known
for
to you
brothers
299779	the
gospel
-
having been preached
299784	by
me
that
not
it is
299790	according to
man
Neither
for
I
299796	from
man
received
it
nor
was I taught [it]
but
299804	by
299806	a revelation
of Jesus
Christ
You have heard of
for
299812	-
299814	my
299817	way of life
former
299820	in
299822	-
Judaism
that
299826	beyond
exceeding measure
I was persecuting
299830	the
299832	church
299834	-
of God
and
was destroying
it
And
I was advancing
299842	in
299844	-
Judaism
299847	beyond
299849	many
299851	contemporaries
299853	in
299855	the
299857	countrymen
of me
more abundantly
299861	zealous
being
299864	of the
299866	fathers
299868	of me
traditions
When
however
was pleased
-
having selected
me
299877	from
299879	[the] womb
299881	of mother
of me
and
having called [me]
299886	by
299888	the
299890	grace
of Him
to reveal
299894	the
299896	Son
of Him
299899	in
me
that
I might preach
Him
299905	among
299907	the
Gentiles
immediately
not
I consulted
with flesh
and
blood
nor
did I go up
299918	to
Jerusalem
299921	to
299923	the
299926	before
me
apostles
but
I went away
299932	into
Arabia
and
again
returned
299938	to
Damascus
Then
299942	after
299944	three
years
I went up
299948	to
Jerusalem
to make acquaintance with
Cephas
and
I remained
299955	with
him
299958	days
fifteen
299961	Other
however
299964	of the
apostles
none
I saw
if
not
James
299972	the
299974	brother
299976	of the
Lord
In what
now
I write
to you
behold
299984	before
299986	-
God
-
not
I lie
Then
I went
299994	into
299996	the
299998	regions
300000	-
of Syria
and
300004	-
Cilicia
300007	I was
then
unknown
300011	-
by face
300014	to the
300016	churches
300018	-
of Judea
300021	that [are]
300023	in
Christ
Only
however
300028	hearing
they were
that
the [one]
persecuting
us
formerly
now
is preaching
300038	the
faith
which
once
he was destroying
And
they were glorifying
300046	in
me
300049	-
God
Then
300053	after
300055	fourteen
years
again
I went up
300060	to
Jerusalem
300063	with
Barnabas
having taken with [me]
300067	also
Titus
I went up
now
300072	according to
a revelation
and
set before
them
300078	the
gospel
that
I proclaim
300083	among
300085	the
Gentiles
300088	apart
individually
however
to those
esteemed
lest
hardly
300096	in
vain
I should be running
or
have run
But
not even
Titus
300105	who [was]
300107	with
me
a Greek
being
was compelled
to be circumcised
300114	because of
even
300117	the
300119	brought in secretly
false brothers
who
came in by stealth
to spy out
300125	the
300127	freedom
of us
which
we have
300132	in
Christ
Jesus
that
us
they will enslave
to whom
not even
300141	for
an hour
did we yield
300145	-
in subjection
so that
300149	the
300151	truth
300153	of the
gospel
might continue
300157	with
you
300160	Of
now
those
esteemed
to be
something
whatsoever
formerly
they were
not
to me
makes a difference
300173	[the] person
300175	-
God
of a man
not
does accept
to me
for
the
esteemed
nothing
added
But
on the contrary
having seen
that
I have been entrusted with
300192	the
300194	gospel
300196	of the
uncircumcision
just as
Peter [with that]
300201	of the
circumcision
the [One]
for
having worked
in Peter
300208	for
300210	apostleship
300212	of the
circumcision
did
300216	also
in me
300219	toward
300221	the
Gentiles
and
having known
300226	the
grace
-
having been given
to me
James
and
Cephas
and
John
those
esteemed
pillars
to be
300241	[the] right hands
gave
to me
and
Barnabas
of fellowship
that
we [should go]
300250	to
300252	the
Gentiles
they
however
300257	to
300259	the
circumcision
Only [they asked]
300263	the
poor
that
we should remember
that
also
I was eager
300271	the same
thing
to do
When
however
came
Peter
300279	to
Antioch
300282	to
face
his
I opposed [him]
because
300288	condemned
he stood
300291	Before
-
for
came
certain ones
300297	from
James
300300	with
300302	the
Gentiles
he was eating
when
however
they came
he was drawing back
and
was separating
himself
being afraid of
300314	those
300316	of
[the] circumcision
And
acted hypocritically
with him
300322	also
300324	the
300326	rest
of [the] Jews
so that
300330	even
Barnabas
was carried away
300334	of them
300336	by the
hypocrisy
But
when
I saw
that
not
they are walking uprightly
300345	according to
300347	the
300349	truth
300351	of the
gospel
I said
300355	-
to Peter
300358	before
all
If
you
a Jew
being
like a Gentile
and
300367	not
like a Jew
live
why
300372	the
Gentiles
do you compel
to Judaize
We
by birth
Jews
and
not
300382	of
[the] Gentiles
sinners
knowing
nevertheless
that
not
is justified
a man
300392	by
300394	works
of law
if
not
300399	through
300401	faith
Christ
from Jesus
300405	even
we
300408	in
Christ
Jesus
have believed
that
we may be justified
300415	by
300417	faith
from Christ
and
not
300422	by
300424	works
of the Law
because
300428	by
300430	works
of the Law
not
will be justified
300435	any
flesh
If
however
seeking
to be justified
300442	in
Christ
have been found
300446	also
we ourselves
sinners
[is] then
Christ
300452	of sin
a minister
Never
may it be
If
for
that
I had torn down
these things
again
I build
a transgressor
myself
I prove
I
for
300469	through
[the] Law
to [the] Law
died
that
to God
I might live


I live
now
no longer
I
lives
however
300485	in
me
Christ
Christ that which
I have been crucified with then
now
I live
300493	in
[the] flesh
300496	through
faith
I live
300500	that
300502	from the
300504	Son
300506	-
of God
the [One]
having loved
me
and
having given up
Himself
300515	for
me
Not
I do set aside
300520	the
300522	grace
300524	-
of God
if
for
300529	through
[the] Law
righteousness [is]
then
Christ
for naught
died
300537	O
300539	foolish
Galatians
Who
you
has bewitched
whose
300546	before
eyes
Jesus
Christ
was publicly portrayed
[as] having been crucified
300553	This
only
I wish
to learn
300558	from
you
300561	by
300563	works
of [the] Law
300566	the
Spirit
did you receive
or
300571	by
300573	hearing
of faith
So
foolish
are you
Having begun
in [the] Spirit
now
in [the] flesh
are you being perfected
So many things
did you suffer
in vain
if
indeed
also
in vain
The [One]
therefore
supplying
to you
300595	the
Spirit
and
working
miracles
300601	among
you
300604	[is it] out of
300606	works
of the Law
or
300610	out of
300612	hearing
of faith
So also
Abraham
believed
300618	-
God
and
it was reckoned
to him
300624	as
righteousness
Know
then
that
300630	those
300632	of
faith
these
300636	sons
are
of Abraham
Having foreseen
then
300642	the
Scripture
that
300646	by
faith
justifies
300650	the
Gentiles
300653	-
God
foretold the gospel
300657	-
to Abraham
-
Will be blessed
300662	in
you
300665	all
300667	the
nations
So then
300671	those
300673	of
faith
are blessed
300677	along with
300679	the
300681	believing
Abraham
As many as
for
300686	of
300688	works
of [the] Law
are
300692	under
a curse
are
it has been written
for
-
Cursed [is]
300700	everyone
who
not
does continue
300705	all things
-
having been written
300709	in
300711	the
300713	book
300715	of the
Law
-
to do
them
That
now
300723	by
[the] law
no one
is justified
300728	before
300730	-
God
[is] evident
because
300735	The
righteous
300738	by
faith
will live
300742	-
And
the Law
not
is
300748	of
faith
rather
The [one]
having done
these things
will live
300756	by
them
Christ
us
redeemed
300762	from
300764	the
300766	curse
300768	of the
Law
having become
300772	for
us
a curse
for
it has been written
Cursed [is]
300779	everyone
-
hanging
300783	on
a tree
so that
300787	to
300789	the
Gentiles
300792	the
300794	blessing
300796	-
of Abraham
might come
300800	in
Jesus
Christ
so that
300805	the
300807	promise
300809	of the
Spirit
we might receive
300813	through
300815	-
faith
Brothers
300819	according to
man
I am speaking
Even
300824	of man
300826	having been ratified
a covenant
no one
sets aside
or
adds thereto
300833	-
And
to Abraham
were spoken
300838	the
promises
and
300842	to the
300844	seed
of him
Not
it does say
and
300850	-
to seeds
as
300854	of
many
but
as
300859	of
One
and
300863	to the
300865	seed
of you
who
is
Christ
This
now
I say
300874	[The] covenant
having been confirmed beforehand
300877	by
300879	-
God
300882	-
300885	afterward
300887	four hundred
and
thirty
years
having come
[the] law
not
does annul
300896	so as
-
to nullify
300900	the
promise
If
for
300905	by
[the] Law [is]
300908	the
inheritance
[it is] no longer
300912	by
a promise
300915	-
but
to Abraham
300919	through
a promise
has granted [it]
300923	-
God
Why
then
300928	the
Law
300932	-
Transgressions
on account of
it was added
300937	until
that
should have come
300941	the
seed
to whom
promise has been made
having been ordained
300947	through
angels
300950	in
300952	[the] hand
of a mediator
300955	-
However
a mediator
of one [person]
not
is
300962	-
but
God
one
is
300968	The
therefore
Law
300972	[is] contrary to
300974	the
300976	promises
300978	-
of God
Never
may it be
If
for
had been given
a law
-
being able
to impart life
indeed
300991	from out of
[the] Law
-
would have emerged
300996	-
righteousness
but
imprisoned
301001	the
Scripture
301004	things
all
301007	under
sin
so that
301011	the
promise
301014	by
301016	faith
from Jesus
Christ
might be given
to those
believing
301023	Before
-
now
came
301028	-
faith
301031	under
the Law
we were held in custody
having been locked up
301036	until
301038	the
301040	being about
faith
to be revealed
so that
301045	the
Law
301048	trainer
of us
has become
301052	unto
Christ
so that
301056	by
faith
we might be justified
Having come
now
301062	-
faith
no longer
301066	under
a trainer
we are
All
for
301072	sons
of God
you are
301076	through
301078	-
301080	faith
301082	in
Christ
Jesus
As many as
for
301088	into
Christ
you were baptized
Christ
you have put on
Neither
there is
Jew
nor
Greek
neither
there is
slave
nor
free
neither
there is
male
and
female
301109	all
for
you
one
are
301115	in
Christ
Jesus
If
now
you [are]
Christâs
then
301125	-
Abrahamâs
seed
you are
301130	according to
[the] promise
heirs
I say
now
301136	for
301138	as long as
time
301141	the
heir
a child
is
not
he differs
from a slave
301149	[though] owner
of everything
being
Instead
301154	under
guardians
he is
and
trustees
301160	until
301162	the
301164	time appointed
301166	by [his]
father
So
301170	also
we
when
we were
children
301176	under
301178	the
301180	basic principles
301182	of the
world
301185	were
held in bondage
When
however
had come
301191	the
301193	fullness
301195	of the
time
sent forth
301199	-
God
301202	the
301204	Son
of him
having been born
301208	of
a woman
having been born
301212	under
[the] Law
that
301216	those
301218	under
[the] Law
He might redeem
so that
301223	the
divine adoption as sons
we might receive
Because
now
you are
sons
sent forth
301232	-
God
301235	the
301237	Spirit
301239	of the
301241	Son
of Him
301244	into
301246	the
301248	hearts
of us
crying out
Abba
301253	-
Father
So
no longer
you are
a slave
but
a son
if
now
a son
301265	also
an heir
301268	through
God
But
at that time
indeed
not
knowing
God
you were enslaved
to those
by nature
not
being
gods
now
however
having known
God
rather
however
having been known
301290	by
God
how
do you turn
again
301296	to
301298	the
301300	weak
and
destitute
principles
to which
301306	again
anew
to be enslaved
you desire
Days
you observe
and
months
and
seasons
and
years
I fear
for you
lest
perhaps
in vain
I have toiled
301325	for
you
Become
as
I [am]
because
I also [have become]
as
you
brothers
I implore
you
In nothing
me
have You wronged
You know
now
that
301344	in
301346	weakness
301348	of the
flesh
I proclaimed the gospel
to you
301353	at the
first
and
301357	the
301360	test
of you
301363	in
301365	the
301367	flesh
of me
not
you did despise [me]
nor
reject [me] with contempt
but
as
301376	an angel
of God
you received
me
even as
Christ
Jesus
What
then
301386	the
301388	blessedness
of you
I bear witness
for
to you
that
if
possible
301397	the
301399	eyes
of you
having gouged out
you would have given [them]
to me
So
301406	enemy
of you
have I become
speaking truth
to you
They are zealous after
you
not
rightly
but
to exclude
you [from us]
They desire
so that
them
you might be zealous after
Good [it is]
now
to be zealous
301426	in
a right [thing]
at all times
and
not
only
301433	in
-
being present
my
301438	with
you
301441	Children
of me
of whom
again
I travail
301447	until
that
shall have been formed
Christ
301452	in
you
I was wishing
indeed
to be present
301458	with
you
presently
and
to change
301464	the
301466	tone
of me
because
I am perplexed
301471	as to
you
Tell
me
those
301477	under
[the] Law
wishing
to be
301482	the
Law
not
you do listen to
It has been written
for
that
Abraham
301491	two
sons
had
301495	one
301497	of
301499	the
slave woman
and
301503	one
301505	of
301507	the
free
But
301511	the [one]
indeed
301514	of
301516	the
slave woman
301519	according to
flesh
has been born
301523	the [one]
but
301526	of
301528	the
free
301531	through
301533	the
promise
which things
are
allegorized
these
for
are
301542	two
covenants
one
indeed
301547	from
301549	Mount
Sinai
301552	unto
slavery
begetting
which
is
Hagar
301559	-
And
Hagar
Sinai
Mount
is
301566	in
301568	-
Arabia
she corresponds
now
301573	to the
301575	present
Jerusalem
she is in slavery
for
301580	with
301582	the
301584	children
of her
301587	-
But
301590	the above
Jerusalem
free
is
who
is
301597	mother
of us
It has been written
for
Rejoice
O barren woman
the [one]
not
bearing
break forth
and
call aloud
the [one]
not
travailing
because
many
301615	[are] the
301617	children
301619	of the
desolate woman
more
than
of her
having
301626	the
husband
You
now
brothers
301632	like
Isaac
301635	of promise
children
are
But
just as
at that time
the [one]
301643	according to
flesh
having been born
was persecuting
301648	the [one born]
301650	according to
Spirit
so
also
[it is] now
But
what
says
301659	the
Scripture
Cast out
301663	the
slave woman
and
301667	the
301669	son
of her
301672	no
for
not
will inherit
301677	the
301679	son
301681	of the
slave woman
301684	along with
301686	the
301688	son
301690	of the
free
So then
brothers
not
we are
301697	of [the] slave woman
children
but
301701	of the
free
301704	In
freedom
us
Christ
has set free
stand firm
therefore
and
not
again
301715	in a yoke
of slavery
entangle yourselves
Behold
I
Paul
say
to you
that
if
you shall become circumcised
Christ
you
nothing
will profit
I testify
now
again
301734	to every
301736	man
being circumcised
that
a debtor
he is
301742	all
301744	the
Law
to keep
You are severed
301749	from
Christ
whoever
301753	in
[the] Law
are being justified
301757	from
grace
you have fallen away
We
for
through [the] Spirit
301764	by
faith
301767	[the] hope
of righteousness
eagerly await
301771	In
for
Christ
Jesus
neither
circumcision
any
has power
nor
uncircumcision
but only
301783	faith
301785	through
love
working
You were running
well
Who
you
cut into
truth
not
to obey
301797	[This]
persuasion [is]
not
301801	of
the [One]
calling
you
301806	A little
leaven
301809	whole
301811	the
lump
leavens
I
am confident
301817	as to
you
301820	in
[the] Lord
that
301824	no
other
mind will you have
The [one]
however
troubling
you
will bear
301833	the
judgment
whoever
if
he might be
I
now
brothers
if
circumcision
still
proclaim
why
still
am I persecuted
In that case
has been abolished
301851	the
301853	offense
301855	of the
cross
I wish
also
will emasculate themselves
those
upsetting
you
You
for
301866	to
freedom
were called
brothers
301871	but
not
301874	the
freedom
301877	for
301879	an opportunity
301881	to the
flesh
Rather
301885	through
301887	-
love
serve
one another
301892	-
For
301895	the entire
Law
301898	in
301900	one
word
is fulfilled
301904	in
this
You shall love
301908	the
301910	neighbor
of you
as
yourself
If
however
one another
you bite
and
devour
take heed

301923	by
one another
you might be consumed

now
by [the] Spirit

and
the Spirit
301953	against
301955	the
flesh
these
for
to one another
are opposed
in order

if
you might wish
those things
you should do
If
however
[the] Spirit
you are led by
not
you are
301975	under
[the] Law
Evident
now
are
301981	the
301983	works
301985	of the
flesh
which
are
sexual immorality
impurity
sensuality
idolatry
sorcery
enmities
strife
jealousy
outbursts of anger
contentions
dissensions
factions
envyings
drunkennesses
carousing
and
302006	things
302008	like
these
as to which
I forewarn
you
even as
I warned before
that
those
302018	such
things
doing
302022	kingdom
Godâs
not
will inherit
302027	-

302030	the fruit

love

302070	-
desires
If
we live
by [the] Spirit
by [the] Spirit
also
we should walk
Not
we should become
boastful
one another
provoking

envying
Brothers
if
even
should be overcome
a man
302091	in
302093	some
trespass
you
302097	the
spiritual [ones]
restore
302101	-
such a one
302104	in
302106	a spirit
of gentleness

302112	also
you
be tempted
302116	One anotherâs
302118	-
burdens
bear you
and
thus
you shall fulfill
302125	the
302127	law
302129	-
of Christ
If
for
thinks [himself]
anyone
to be
something

himself

302145	the work

then
302152	as to
himself
alone

not

302164	-
another
Each
for
302169	-
302171	his own
load
shall bear
Let share
now
the [one]
being taught
302179	in the
word
with the [one]
teaching
302184	in
302186	all
good things
Not
be misled
God
not
is mocked
Whatever
for
if
might sow
a man
that
also
he will reap
For
the [one]
sowing
302205	to
302207	the
302209	flesh
of himself
302212	from
302214	the
flesh

sowing
302222	to
302224	the
Spirit
302227	from
302229	the
Spirit
will reap
302233	life
eternal
302236	-
And
[in] well
doing
not
we should grow weary
302243	in time
for
due
we will reap a harvest
not
giving up
So
then
as
occasion
we have
we should work
302256	-
good
302259	toward
all
especially
now
302264	toward
302266	those
302268	of the household

302274	in how large
to you
letters
I have written
302279	with
302281	my own
hand
As many as
wish
to have a fair appearance
302287	in
[the] flesh

compel
you
to be circumcised
only
that
302296	for the
302298	cross

they desire
you
to be circumcised
so that
302318	in
302320	-

they may boast

however
never
may it be
to boast

never

303113	of the
303115	flesh

303121	things willed
303123	of the

in trespasses
made [us] alive with
303171	-
Christ
by grace
303175	you are

He raised [us] up together
and
seated [us] together
303182	in
303184	the

For
by grace
303228	you are
saved
303231	through
faith
and
this
not
303237	of
yourselves
303240	[it is] of God
303242	the
gift
not
303246	as a result of
works
so that
not
anyone
may boast
303253	Of Him
for
we are
workmanship
having been created
303259	in
Christ
Jesus
303263	for
303265	works
good
which
prepared beforehand
303270	-
God
that
303274	in
them
we should walk
Therefore
remember
that
formerly
you
303284	the
Gentiles
303287	in
[the] flesh
the ones
being called
[the] uncircumcision
303293	by
that
being called
303298	[the] circumcision
303300	in
[the] flesh
made by hands
that
you were
303307	at the
time
that
303311	separate from
Christ
303314	alienated from
303316	the
303318	commonwealth
303320	-
of Israel
and
303324	strangers
303326	to the
303328	covenants
303330	of the
promise
hope
not
having
and
303337	without God
303339	in
303341	the
world
Now
however
303346	in
Christ
Jesus
you
the [ones]
once
being
far off
have become
near
303357	by
303359	the
303361	blood
303363	-
of Christ
He Himself
for
is
303369	the
303371	peace
of us
-
having made
303376	-
both
one
and
303381	the
303383	barrier
303385	of the
fence
having broken down
303389	the
hostility
303392	in
303394	the
303396	flesh
of Him
303399	the
303401	law
303403	-
303405	of commandments
303407	in
ordinances
having annulled
so that
303412	the
two
He might create
303416	in
Himself
303419	into
303421	one
303423	new
man
making
peace
and
He might reconcile
303430	-
both
303433	in
303435	one
body
303438	-
to God
303441	through
303443	the
cross
having slain
303447	the
hostility
303450	by
it
And
having come
He proclaimed the gospel
peace
to you
303458	the [ones]
far off
and
peace
303463	to those
near
For
303467	through
Him
we have
303471	the
access
303474	-
both
303477	by
303479	one
Spirit
303482	to
303484	the
Father
So
then
no longer
are you
strangers
and
aliens
but
are
303496	fellow citizens
303498	of the
saints
and
303502	of the household
303504	-
of God
having been built
303508	upon
303510	the
303512	foundation
303514	of the
apostles
and
prophets
being
[the] cornerstone
303521	Himself
Christ
Jesus
303525	in
whom
303528	the whole
building
being fitted together
is increasing
303533	into
303535	a temple
holy
303538	in
[the] Lord
303541	in
whom
303544	also
you
are being built together
303548	for
303550	a habitation
303552	-
of God
303555	in
[the] Spirit

for reason
I
Paul
303563	the
303566	prisoner
303568	-
of Christ
Jesus
303572	for
you
303575	-
Gentiles
If
indeed
you have heard of
303581	the
303583	administration
303585	of the
303587	grace
303589	-
of God
-
having been given
to me
303595	toward
you
that
303599	by
revelation
He made known
to me
303604	the
mystery
just as
I have written before
303609	in
brief
303612	by
which
you are able
reading [it]
to understand
303618	the
303621	insight
of me
303624	into
303626	the
303628	mystery
303630	-
of Christ
which
303634	in other
generations
not
was made known
303639	to the
303641	sons
303643	-
of men
as
now
it has been revealed
303649	to
303652	holy
apostles
His
and
prophets
303658	in
[the] Spirit
are
303662	the
Gentiles
joint-heirs
and
a joint-body
and
303669	joint-partakers
303671	of the
promise
303674	in
Christ
Jesus
303678	through
303680	the
gospel
303683	of which
I became
servant
303687	according to
303689	the
303691	gift
303693	of the
303695	grace
303697	-
of God
-
having been given
to me
303703	according to
303705	the
303707	working
303709	of the
303711	power
of Him
To me
303715	the
303717	very least
303719	of all
saints
was given
303724	the
grace
this
303728	to the
Gentiles
to preach
303732	the
303735	unsearchable
riches
303738	-
of Christ
and
to enlighten
what [is]
303744	the
303746	administration
303748	of the
mystery
-
having been hidden
303753	from
303755	the
ages
303758	in
303760	-
God
the [One]
303764	-
all things
having created
so that
should be made known
now
303772	to the

303795	-
of God
303798	according to
303800	[the] purpose
303802	of the
ages
which
He accomplished
303807	in
303809	-
Christ
Jesus
303813	the
303815	Lord
of us
303818	in
whom
we have
303822	-
boldness
and
access
303827	in
confidence
303830	by
303832	the
303834	faith
from Him
Therefore
I implore [you]
not
to lose heart
303841	at
303843	the
303846	tribulations
of me
303849	for
you
which
is
303854	glory
of you
303857	... of this
for reason
I bow
303861	the
303863	knees
of me
303866	to
303868	the
Father
303871	from

of Him
with power
to be strengthened

being founded
so that
you may be fully able
to comprehend
303941	with
303943	all
303945	the
saints
what [is]
303949	the
breadth
and

Amen
Exhort
therefore
you
I
304042	the
304044	prisoner
304046	in
[the] Lord
worthily
to walk
304051	of the
calling
to which
you were called
304056	with
304058	all
humility
and
gentleness
304063	with
patience
bearing with
one another

being diligent
to keep

304080	in
304082	the
304084	bond
304086	-
of peace
304089	one
body
and
304093	one
Spirit
just as
also
you were called
304099	into
304101	one
304103	hope
304105	of the
304107	calling
of you

304116	one
baptism

God
and
304123	Father
of all
304126	who [is]
304128	over
all
and
304132	through
all
and
304136	in
all
304140	One
now
to each
of us
has been given
304146	-
grace
304149	according to
304151	the
304153	measure
304155	of the
304157	gift
304159	-
of Christ
Therefore
it says
Having ascended
304165	on
high
He led captive
captivity
gave
gifts
304172	-
to men
-
And
He ascended
what
is
if
not
that
also
He descended
304185	into
304187	the
304189	lower
304191	regions
304193	of the
earth
304196	The [One]
having descended
the same
is
304201	also
[one]
having ascended
304205	above
304207	all
304209	the
heavens
so that
He might fill
304214	-
all things
And
He
gave
304220	some
indeed
[to be] apostles
304224	some
now
prophets
304228	some
now
evangelists
304232	some
now
shepherds
and
teachers
304238	toward
304240	the
304244	perfecting
304246	of the
saints
304249	for
304251	[the] work
of ministry
304254	for
304256	[the] building up
304258	of the
304260	body
304262	-
of Christ
until
we may attain
304267	-
all
304270	to
304272	the
304274	unity
304276	of the
faith
and
304280	of the
304282	knowledge
304284	of the
304286	Son
304288	-
of God
304291	unto
304293	a man
a complete
304296	to
304298	[the] measure
304300	of [the] stature
304302	of the
304304	fullness
304306	-
of Christ
so that
no longer
we might be
304312	infants
being tossed by waves
and
being carried about
304317	by every
304319	wind
304321	-
of teaching
304324	in
304326	the
304329	cunning
304331	-
of men
304334	in
304336	craftiness
304338	with a view to
304340	the
304342	scheming
304344	-
of deceit
Speaking the truth
however
304349	in
love
we should grow up
304353	into
Him
304356	in
all things
who
is
304361	the
head
Christ
304365	from
whom
304368	all
304370	the
body
being joined together
and
being held together
304376	by
304378	every
ligament
304381	of [its]
supply
304384	according to
304387	[the] working
304389	in
[the] measure
304392	individual
of each
part
304396	the
304398	increase
304400	of the
body
makes for itself
304404	to
304407	[the] building up
of itself
304410	in
love
This
therefore
I say
and
testify
304418	in
[the] Lord
No longer
[are] you
to walk
as
also
304426	the
Gentiles
are walking
304430	in
304432	[the] futility
304434	of the
304436	mind
of them
304439	being darkened
304441	in the
understanding
being
alienated from
304446	the
304448	life
304450	-
of God
304453	because of
304455	the
ignorance
-
being
304460	in
them
304463	on account of
304465	the
304467	hardness
304469	of the
304471	heart
of them
who
having cast off all feeling
themselves
have given up
304478	to
sensuality
304481	for
304484	[the] working
304486	of impurity
all
304489	with
greediness
You
however
not
this way
learned
304497	-
Christ
if
indeed
Him
you have heard
and
304505	in
Him
have been taught
just as
is
[the] truth
304512	in
304514	-
Jesus
Are to have put off
you
304519	concerning
304521	the
304523	former
way of life
304526	the
304528	old
man
which
is being corrupted
304533	according to
304535	[its]
304537	desires
304539	-
of deceit
to be renewed
then
304544	in the
304546	spirit
304548	of the
304550	mind
of you
and
to have put on
304555	the
304557	new
man
-
304561	according to
God
having been created
304565	in
304567	righteousness
and
holiness
304571	-
of truth
Therefore
having put off
304576	-
falsehood
let speak
truth
each one
304582	with
304584	the
304586	neighbor
of him
because
we are
304591	of one another
members
Be angry
and yet
not
sin
304598	The
sun
not
let set
304603	upon
304605	anger
of you
neither
give
opportunity
304611	to the
devil
The [one]
stealing
no longer
let him steal
rather
however
let him toil
working
304622	with the
304624	own
hands
304627	what
[is] good
so that
he may have [something]
to impart
to the [one]
need
having
304636	Any
304638	word
unwholesome
304641	out of
304643	the
304645	mouth
of you
not
let go forth
but
if
any
good
304654	for
304656	edification
304658	of the
need
so that
it may give
grace
to those
hearing
And
not
grieve
304669	the
Spirit
304672	-
304674	Holy
304676	-
of God
304679	in
whom
you were sealed
304683	for
304685	[the] day
of redemption
304688	All
bitterness
and
rage
and
anger
and
clamor
and
slander
let be removed
304700	from
you
304703	along with
304705	all
malice
Be
now
304710	to
one another
304713	kind
tender-hearted
forgiving
each other
as
304719	also
304721	-
God
304724	in
Christ
forgave
you
Be
therefore
304731	imitators
304733	-
of God
as
304737	children
beloved
and
walk
304742	in
love
just as
304746	also
304748	-
Christ
loved
us
and
gave up
himself
304756	for
us
304760	[as] an offering
and
a sacrifice
304764	-
to God
304767	into
304769	an aroma
of a sweet smell
Sexual immorality
however
and
304775	impurity
all
or
covetousness
not even
let be named
304782	among
you
as also
is proper
to saints
and
filthiness
and
foolish talking
or
crude joking
which
not
are fitting
but
rather
thanksgiving
This
for
you know
realizing
that
304805	any
fornicator
or
unclean person
or
covetous man
who
is
an idolater
not
has
inheritance
304818	in
304820	the
304822	kingdom
304824	-
of Christ
and
of God
No one
you
let deceive
304832	with empty
words
304835	because of
these things
for
comes
304840	the
304842	wrath
304844	-
of God
304847	upon
304849	the
304851	sons
304853	-
of disobedience
Not
therefore
be
304859	partakers
with them
You were
for
once
darkness
now
however
light
304869	in
[the] Lord
as
304873	children
of light
walk
304877	-
for
304880	the fruit
304882	of the
light [is]
304885	in
304887	all
goodness
and
righteousness
and
truth
discerning
what
is
well-pleasing
304898	to the
Lord
And
not
have fellowship with
304904	the
works
304907	-
304909	unfruitful
304911	-
of darkness
rather
however
even
expose [them]
the things
for
in secret
being done
304922	by
them
shameful
it is
even
to mention
304929	-
But
everything
being exposed
304934	by
304936	the
light
is made visible
304940	everything
for
-
becoming visible
light
is
Therefore
it says
Awake you
the [one]
sleeping
and
rise up
304954	out from
304956	the
dead
and
will shine upon
you
304962	-
Christ
Take heed
therefore
carefully
how
you walk
not
as
unwise
but
as
wise
redeeming
304977	the
time
because
304981	the
days
evil
are
304986	Because of
this
not
be
foolish
but
understand
what
304995	the
304997	will
304999	of the
Lord [is]
And
not
to be drunk
with wine
305006	in
which
is
debauchery
Instead
be filled
305013	with
[the] Spirit
speaking
to each other
psalms
and
hymns
and
305022	songs
spiritual
singing
and
making melody
305028	in the
305030	heart
of you
305033	to the
Lord
giving thanks
at all times
305038	for
all things
305041	in
305043	[the] name
305045	the
305047	Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
305052	to the
God
and
Father
Be submitting yourselves
to one another
305059	in
305061	reverence
of Christ
305064	-
wives
305067	to the
305069	own
husbands
as
305073	to the
Lord
for
[the] husband
is
305079	head
305081	of the
wife
as
305085	also
305087	-
Christ
305090	[is the] head
305092	of the
church
He Himself
305096	Savior
305098	of the
body
But
even as
305103	the
church
is subjected
305107	-
to Christ
so
305111	also
305113	-
wives
305116	to the own
husbands
305119	in
everything
305122	-
Husbands
love
305126	the
wives
just as
305130	also
305132	-
Christ
loved
305136	the
church
and
Himself
gave up
305142	for
her
so that
her
He might sanctify
having cleansed [her]
305149	by the
305151	washing
305153	-
of water
305156	by
[the] word
so that
might present
He
to Himself
305163	in glory
305165	the
church
not
having
spot
or
wrinkle
or
305174	any
305176	of the
such things
but
that
it would be
holy
and
blameless
So
ought
305187	also
305189	-
husbands
to love
305193	the
305195	of themselves
wives
as
305199	the
305201	of themselves
bodies
The [one]
loving
305206	the
305208	of himself
wife
himself
loves
No one
for
at any time
305216	the
305218	of himself
flesh
hated
but
he nourishes
and
cherishes
it
just as
305228	also [does]
305230	-
Christ
305233	the
church
for
305237	members
we are
305240	of the
305242	body
of Him
305245	Because of
this
will leave
a man
305250	his
father
and
305254	-
mother
and
be joined
305259	to
305261	the
305263	wife
of him
and
will be
305268	the
two
305271	into
305273	flesh
one
305277	The
mystery
this
great
is
I
however
speak
305286	as to
Christ
and
305290	as to
305292	the
church
However
305296	also

305299	-
305301	according to
individual
each
305305	the
305307	of himself
wife
so
let love
as
himself
305314	-
and
the wife
that
she may respect
305320	the
husband
305323	-
Children
obey
305327	the
305329	parents

305355	with
a promise
that
well
with you
it may be
and
you will be
long-lived
305365	upon
305367	the
earth
And
305371	-
fathers
not
provoke
305376	the
305378	children
of you
but
bring up
them

of [the] Lord

[the] heart
305442	with
good will
rendering service
as
305447	to the
Lord
and
not
to men

305457	whatever
he might have done
good
this
he will receive [back]

and
flesh
but
305562	against
305564	the
rulers
305567	against

305886	To all

Grace

305944	for
305946	all

joy
305952	the

305956	for
305958	the
305962	partnership
of you
305965	in
305967	the
gospel
305970	from
305972	the
305974	first
day
305977	until
305979	-
now
being persuaded of
305983	[the] very thing
this
that
305987	the [One]
having begun
305990	in
you
305993	a work
good
will complete [it]
305997	until
305999	[the] day
of Christ
Jesus
Accordingly
it is
right
for me
this
to feel
306009	about
306011	all
of you
306014	since
-
have
I
306019	in
306021	the
heart
you
306025	in
both
306028	the
306030	chains
of me
and
306034	in
306036	the
306038	defense
and
confirmation
306042	of the
gospel
306046	fellow partakers
with me
306049	of
grace
306052	all
you
are
306056	Witness
for
my
306060	-
God [is]
how
I long after
306065	all
you
306068	in
306070	[the] affection
of Christ
Jesus
And
this
I pray
that
306078	the
306080	love
of you
yet
more
and
more
may abound
306088	in
knowledge
and
306092	all
discernment
306095	for
-
to approve
you
the things
being excellent
so that
you may be
pure
and
blameless
306107	unto
306109	[the] day
of Christ
being filled
306113	with [the] fruit
of righteousness
306116	that [is]
306118	through
Jesus
Christ
306122	to
306124	[the] glory
and
praise
of God
To know
now
you
I want
brothers
that
306135	the things
306137	concerning
me
really
306141	to
306143	[the] advancement
306145	of the
gospel
have turned out
so as for
306150	the
306152	chains
of me
clearly known
306156	in
Christ
to have become
306160	in
306162	all
306164	the
palace guard
and
306169	to the
rest
all
and
306174	-
306176	most
306178	of the
brothers
306181	in
[the] Lord
trusting
306185	by the
306187	chains
of me
more abundantly
to dare
fearlessly
306193	the
306195	word
306197	of
God
to speak
Some
indeed
306203	even
306205	from
envy
and
strife
some
however
306212	also
306214	from
goodwill
306217	-
Christ
are proclaiming
the [ones]
indeed
306223	out of
love
knowing
that
306228	for
306230	defense
306232	of the
gospel
I am appointed
the [ones]
however
306238	out of
selfish ambition
306241	-
Christ
are proclaiming
not
purely
supposing
tribulation
to add
306250	to the
306252	chains
of me
What
then
Only
that
306259	in every
way
whether
in pretext
or
in truth
Christ
is proclaimed
And
306269	in
this
I rejoice
Yes
and
I will rejoice
I know
for
that
this
for me
will turn out
306282	to
deliverance
306285	through
306287	-
306289	your
prayer
and
306293	[the] provision
306295	of the
306297	Spirit
of Jesus
Christ
306301	according to
306303	the
306305	earnest expectation
and
hope
of me
that
306311	in
nothing
I will be ashamed
but
306316	in
306318	all
boldness
306321	as
always
also
now
will be magnified
Christ
306328	in
306330	the
306332	body
of me
whether
306336	by
life
or
306340	by
death
To me
for
-
to live
[is] Christ
and
-
to die
[is] gain
If [I am]
however
-
to live
306356	in
flesh
this
for me
306361	[is the] fruit
of labor
And
what
shall I choose
Not
I know
I am pressed
however
306371	between
306373	the
two
306376	the
desire
having
306380	for [myself]
-
to depart
and
306385	with
Christ
to be
very much
for
more
better
-
but
to remain
306396	the
flesh
[is] more necessary
306400	for the sake of
you
And
this
having been persuaded of
I know
that
I will remain
and
will continue with
306411	all
of you
306414	for
306416	-
306418	your
progress
and
306422	joy
306424	of the
faith
so that
306428	the
306430	boasting
of you
may abound
306434	to
Christ
Jesus
306438	in
me
306441	through
306443	-
306445	my
306448	coming
again
306451	to
you
Only
worthily
306456	of the
306458	gospel
306460	-
of Christ
conduct yourselves
so that
whether
having come
and
having seen
you
or
being absent
I might hear
306473	the things
306475	concerning
you
that
you are standing firm
306480	in
306482	one
spirit
306485	with one
mind
striving together
306489	for the
306491	faith
306493	of the
gospel
and
not
being frightened
306499	in
nothing
306502	by
those
opposing [you]
which
is
to them
306509	a demonstration
of destruction
306512	to you
however
of salvation
and
this
306518	from
God
For
to you
it has been granted
306524	-
306526	concerning
Christ
306529	not
only
-
306533	in
Him
to believe
but
306538	also
-
306541	concerning
Him
to suffer
306545	the
306547	same
conflict
having
such as
you saw
306553	in
me
and
now
hear of
306559	in
me
If [there is]
306563	any
therefore
encouragement
306567	in
Christ
if
306571	any
306573	comfort
of love
if
306577	any
306579	fellowship
of [the] Spirit
if
306583	any
affections
and
compassions
fulfill
306589	my
306591	-
joy
so that
306595	the
same
you may be minded
306599	the
306601	same
love
having
united in soul
306606	the
same thing
minding
nothing
306611	according to
self-interest
or
306615	according to
vain conceit
but
306619	-
in humility
one another
be esteeming
surpassing
themselves
not
306627	the things
of themselves
each
considering
but
306633	also
306635	the things
of others
each
This
let mind be
306641	in
you
which
also
306646	in
Christ
Jesus [was]
Who
306651	in
306653	[the] form
of God
existing
not
something to be grasped
considered
-
to be
equal
with God
but
Himself
emptied
306667	[the] form
of a servant
having taken
306671	in
306673	[the] likeness
of men
having been made
And
in appearance
having been found
as
a man
He humbled
Himself
having become
obedient
306686	unto
death
306689	[the] death
even
of [the] cross
Therefore
306694	also
306696	-
God
Him
highly exalted
and
granted
to Him
306704	the
name
306707	-
306709	above
306711	every
name
that
306715	at
306717	the
306719	name
of Jesus
306722	every
306724	knee
should bow
in the heavens
and
on earth
and
under the earth
and
306733	every
tongue
should confess
that
[is] Lord
Jesus
Christ
306741	to
306743	[the] glory
of God
[the] Father
Therefore
306748	beloved
of me
just as
always
you have obeyed
not
as
306756	in
306758	the
306760	presence
of me
only
but
now
306766	much
more
306769	in
306771	the
306773	absence
of me
306776	with
fear
and
trembling
306781	-
306783	your own
salvation
work out
God
for
is
the [One]
working
306792	in
you
both
-
to will
and
-
to work
306801	according to
306803	[His]
good pleasure
All things
do
306808	without
murmurings
and
disputings
so that
you may be
blameless
and
innocent
306819	children
of God
unblemished
306823	in [the] midst
306825	of a generation
crooked
and
perverted
306830	among
whom
you shine
as
lights
306836	in
[the] world
306839	[the] word
of life
holding forth
306843	unto
306845	a boast
to me
306848	in
306850	[the] day
of Christ
that
not
306855	in
vain
I did run
nor
306860	in
vain
toil
But
if
even
I am being poured out as a drink offering
306868	on
306870	the
306872	sacrifice
and
service
306876	of the
306878	faith
of you
I am glad
and
rejoice with
306884	all
you
306887	-
And
likewise
306891	also
you
be glad
and
rejoice with
me
I hope
however
306900	in
[the] Lord
Jesus
Timothy
soon
to send
to you
that
I also
may be encouraged
having known
306912	the things
306914	concerning
you
306917	No one
for
I have
like-minded
who
genuinely
306924	the things
306926	relative to
you
will care for
306930	Those
all
for
306934	the things
of themselves
are seeking
not
306939	the things
of Christ
Jesus
306943	-
But
306946	the proven worth
of him
you know
that
as
a father [with]
a child
306954	with
me
he has served
306958	in
306960	the
gospel
Him
indeed
therefore
I hope
to send
when
-
I shall have seen
306971	the things
306973	concerning
me
immediately
I am persuaded
now
306979	in
[the] Lord
that
306983	also
I myself
soon
I will come
Necessary
now
I esteemed [it]
Epaphroditus
306992	the
306994	brother
and
fellow worker
and
fellow soldier
of me
307001	of you
now
messenger
and
307006	minster
307008	of the
307010	need
of me
to send
307014	to
you
since
307018	longing after
he was
307021	all
you
and
being deeply distressed
because
you heard
that
he was ill
And
indeed
he was sick
307033	nearly
unto death
but
307037	-
God
had mercy on
him
not
307043	on him
now
alone
but
307048	also
on me
that
not
sorrow
307054	upon
sorrow
I should have
All the more speedily
therefore
I have sent
him
that
having seen
him
again
you may rejoice
and I
less anxious
might be
Receive
therefore
him
307073	in
[the] Lord
307076	with
307078	all
joy
and
307082	-
such
in honor
hold
because
307088	for the sake of
307090	the
307092	work
of Christ
307095	unto
death
he came near
having disregarded
307100	[his]
life
so that
he might fill up
307105	the
307108	of you
deficit
307111	of
307114	toward
me
service
307118	-
Finally
307121	brothers
of me
rejoice
307125	in
[the] Lord
307128	The
same things
to write
to you
to me
indeed
[is] not
troublesome
for you
now
[is] safe
Beware of
307141	the
dogs
beware of
307145	the
307147	evil
workers
beware of
307151	the
false circumcision
We
for
are
307157	the
circumcision
those
307161	in [the] Spirit
of God
worshiping
and
glorying
307167	in
Christ
Jesus
and
not
307173	in
[the] flesh
having put confidence
though
I
have
confidence
307181	even
307183	in
[the] flesh
If
307187	any
thinks
other
to have confidence
307192	in
[the] flesh
I
more
circumcision
on [the] eighth day
307199	of
307201	[the] nation
of Israel
307204	of [the] tribe
of Benjamin
307207	a Hebrew
307209	of
Hebrews
307212	according to
[the] Law
a Pharisee
307216	according to
zeal
persecuting
307220	the
church
307223	according to
righteousness
307226	which [is]
307228	in
[the] Law
having become
faultless
But
whatever things
were
to me
gain
these
I have esteemed
307240	because of
307242	-
Christ
loss
But
-
therefore
indeed
also
I count
all things
loss
to be
307255	because of
307257	the
excelling
307260	-
307262	knowledge
of Christ
Jesus
307266	the
307268	Lord
of me
307271	because of
whom
307274	-
all things
I have lost
and
esteem [them]
rubbish
that
Christ
I may gain
and
be found
307286	in
Him
not
having
307291	my own
righteousness
307294	which [is]
307296	of
[the] Law
but
307300	that
307302	through
307304	faith
from Christ
307307	the
307310	of
God
307313	righteousness
307315	on the basis of
307317	-
faith
-
to know
Him
and
307324	the
307326	power
307328	of the
307330	resurrection
of Him
and
307334	fellowship
307336	sufferings
of Him
being conformed
307340	to the
307342	death
of Him
if
by any means
I may attain
307348	to
307350	the
resurrection
307353	-
307355	out from
dead
Not
that
already
I have obtained [it]
or
already
have been perfected
I am pursuing
however
if
also
I may lay hold
307370	of
that for which
also
I was laid hold of
307375	by
Christ
Jesus
Brothers
I
myself
not
do consider
to have taken hold [of it]
One thing
however
307387	The things
indeed
behind
forgetting
307392	to the things
now
ahead
reaching forward
307397	toward
[the] goal
I press on
307401	for
307403	the
307405	prize
307407	of the
307409	upward
307412	calling
307414	-
of God
307417	in
Christ
Jesus
As many as
therefore
[are] mature
this
should be of mind
and
if [in]
anything
differently
you are minded
307431	even
this
307434	-
God
to you
will reveal
Nevertheless
307440	to
that which
we have attained
307444	by the
same
to walk
307448	Imitators together
of me
be
brothers
and
observe
those
thus
walking
as
you have
[for] a pattern
us
Many
for
are walking
[of] whom
often
I told
you
now
indeed
even
weeping
I say
307474	-
307476	[as] enemies
307478	of the
307480	cross
307482	-
of Christ
307485	whose
307487	-
end [is]
destruction
307491	whose
307493	-
God [is]
307496	the
belly
and
307500	-
glory
307503	[is] in
307505	the
307507	shame
of them
those
307511	things
earthly
minding
307515	Of us
for
307518	the
citizenship
307521	in
[the] heavens
exists
307525	from
whence
also
a Savior
we are awaiting
[the] Lord
Jesus
Christ
who
will transform
307536	the
307538	body
307540	-
307542	of humiliation
of us
307545	conformed
307547	to the
307549	body
307551	of the
307553	glory
of Himself
307556	according to
307558	the
307560	working

enabling
Him
even
to subdue
to Himself
307568	-
all things
Therefore

307613	in

307620	with
also
Clement
and
307625	the
307627	rest
307629	of [the] fellow workers

Rejoice

And
307691	the

surpassing
307699	all

will guard
307703	the

right
whatever
pure
whatever
lovely
whatever
admirable
if
any

think on
What
also
you have learned

I rejoiced
however
307772	in
[the] Lord
greatly
that
now
at last
you revived
the

me
caring
307785	wherein
which
also
you were concerned
you were lacking opportunity
however
Not
that
307794	as to
destitution
I speak
I
for
have learned
307801	in
that which
I am
content
to be
I know
also
[how] to be brought low
I know
also
[how] to abound
307813	In
everything
and
307817	in
all things
I have learned the secret
also
to be full
and
to hunger
also
to abound
and
to be deficient
[For] all things
I have strength
307831	in
the [One]

me
But

308580	the
308582	body
308584	of the
308586	flesh
of Him
308589	through
308591	-
death
to present
you
holy
and
unblemished
and
blameless
308601	before
Him
if
indeed
you continue
308607	-
in the faith
established
and
firm
and
not
being moved away
308616	from
308618	the
308620	hope
308622	of the
gospel
that
you have heard
-
having been proclaimed
308629	in
308631	all
creation
308634	-
308636	under
308638	-
heaven
308641	of which
have become
I
Paul
a minister
Now
I rejoice
308649	in
308651	the
sufferings
308654	for
you
and
I am filling up
308659	that which
308661	is lacking
308663	of the
308665	tribulations
308667	-
of Christ
308670	in
308672	the
308674	flesh
of me
308677	for
308679	the
308681	body
of Him
which
is
308686	the
church
308689	of which
became
I
a minister
308694	according to
308696	the
308698	administration
308700	-
of God
-
having been given
me
308706	toward
you
to complete
308710	the
308712	word
308714	-
of God
308717	the
mystery
-
having been hidden
308722	from
308724	the
ages
and
308728	from
308730	the
generations
now
however
having been manifested
308736	to the
308738	saints
of Him
to whom
has willed
308743	-
God
to make known
what [is]
308748	the
308750	riches
308752	of the
308754	glory
308757	of the
mystery
this
308761	among
308763	the
Gentiles
which
is
308768	Christ
308770	in
you
308773	the
308775	hope
308777	-
of glory
whom
we
preach
admonishing
308784	every
man
and
teaching
308789	every
man
308792	in
308794	all
wisdom
so that
we may present
308799	every
man
perfect
308803	in
Christ
308806	Unto
this
also
I toil
striving
308812	according to
308814	the
308816	energy
of Him
-
working
308821	in
me
308824	in
power
I want
for
you
to know
308831	how great
a struggle
I am having
308835	for
you
and
308839	those
308841	in
Laodicea
and
as many as
not
have seen
308848	the
308850	face
of me
308853	in
[the] flesh
that
may be encouraged
308858	the
308860	hearts
of them
having been knit together
308864	in
love
and
308868	to
308870	all
308872	[the] riches
308874	of the
308876	full assurance
308878	-
of understanding
308881	to
308883	[the] knowledge
308885	of the
308887	mystery
308889	-
of God
[which is] Christ
308893	in
whom
are
308897	all
308899	the
308901	treasures
308903	-
of wisdom
and
of knowledge
hidden
This
I say
so that
no one
you
might delude
308915	by
persuasive speech
If
truly
308920	indeed
308922	in the
flesh
I am absent
yet
308927	-
in spirit
308930	with
you
I am
rejoicing
and
seeing
308937	your
308939	-
good order
and
308943	the
308945	firmness
308947	of the
308950	in
Christ
308953	faith
of you
Just as
therefore
you have received
308959	-
Christ
Jesus
308963	the
Lord
308966	in
Him
walk
having been rooted
and
being built up
308973	in
Him
and
being strengthened in
308978	the
faith
just as
you were taught
abounding
308984	with
thanksgiving
Take heed
lest
anyone
you
there will be
-
taking captive
308994	through
308996	-
philosophy
and
309000	empty
deceit
309003	according to
309005	the
309007	tradition
309009	-
of men
309012	according to
309014	the
309016	principles
309018	of the
world
and
309022	not
309024	according to
Christ
For
309028	in
Him
dwells
309032	all
309034	the
309036	fullness
309038	of the
Deity
bodily
and
309043	you are
309045	in
Him
complete
who
is
309051	the
309053	head
309055	of all
rule
and
authority
309060	in
whom
also
you were circumcised
309065	with [the] circumcision
made without hands
309068	in
309070	the
309072	removal
309074	of the
309076	body
309078	of the
flesh
309081	in
309083	the
309085	circumcision
309087	-
of Christ
having been buried with
Him
309092	in
309094	-
baptism
309097	in
which
also
you were raised with [Him]
309102	through
309104	the
309106	faith
309108	of the
309110	working
309112	-
of God
the [One]
having raised
Him
309118	out from
the dead
And
you
dead
being
309125	the
trespasses
and
309129	in the
309131	uncircumcision
309133	of the
309135	flesh
of you
He made alive together
you
309140	with
Him
having forgiven
us
309145	all
309147	the
transgressions
having blotted out
309151	the
309154	against
us
309157	handwriting
309159	in the
decrees
which
was
309164	adverse
to us
and
it
He has taken
309170	out of
309172	the
way
having nailed
it
309177	to the
cross
Having disarmed
309181	the
rulers
and
309185	the
authorities
He made a show [of them]
309189	in
public
having triumphed
over them
309194	in
it
Not
therefore
anyone
you
let judge
309202	in regard to
food
or
309206	in regard to
drink
or
309210	in
309212	regard
to a feast
or
a New Moon
or
Sabbaths
which
are
309221	a shadow
the things
coming
309225	the
however
body [is]
309229	-
of Christ
No one
you
let disqualify
delighting
309236	in
humility
and
309240	[the] worship
309242	of the
angels
which
he has seen
detailing
vainly
being puffed up
309250	by
309252	the
309254	mind
309256	of the
309258	flesh
of him
and
not
holding fast
309264	to the
head
309267	from
whom
309270	all
309272	the
body
309275	by
309277	the
joints

ligaments
being supplied
and
being knit together
increases
309286	with the
309288	increase
309290	-
of God
If
you have died
309295	with
Christ
309298	away from
309300	the
309302	principles
309304	of the
world
why
as if
living
309310	in
[the] world
do you submit to decrees
Not
you should handle
Not
you should taste
Not
you should touch
which
are
309322	all
309324	unto
309326	decay
309328	with the
use
309331	according to
309333	the
309335	commandments
and
teachings
309339	-
of men
which
are
309344	an appearance
indeed
having
of wisdom
309349	in
self-imposed worship
and
humility
and
309355	harsh treatment
of [the] body
not
309359	of
309361	honor
a certain
309364	against
309366	[the] indulgence
309368	of the
flesh
If
then
you have been raised with
309374	-
Christ
309377	the things
above
seek
where
309382	-
Christ
309385	is
309387	at [the]
309389	right hand
309391	-
of God

earth
You have died
for
and
309410	the
309412	life
of you
has been hidden
309416	with
309418	-
Christ
309421	in
309423	-
God
When
309427	-
Christ
may be revealed

of you
then
309437	also
you
309440	with
Him
will appear
309444	in

Put to death
therefore

is
idolatry
309472	because of
which things
is coming
309476	the
309478	wrath
309480	-
of God
309483	in
which
309486	also
you
walked
once
when
you were living
309493	in
them
Now
however
put off
309499	also
you

one another

not

310466	the

310471	-
310473	toward

has gone abroad
so as for
no

They themselves

310488	concerning
us
report
310492	what
reception
we had
310496	from
you
and
how
you turned
310502	to
310504	-
God
310507	from
310509	-
idols
to serve
310513	[the] God

and

of Him
310525	from
310527	the

whom
He raised

the [one]
delivering

coming
You yourselves
for
know
brothers
310552	the
310554	coming
of us
310557	-
310559	to
you
that
not
in vain
has been
but
having previously suffered
and
having been mistreated
just as
you know
310572	in
Philippi
we had boldness
310576	in
310578	the
310580	God
of us
to speak
310584	to
you
310587	the
310589	gospel
310591	-
of God
310594	amid
310596	much
conflict
310599	-
For
310602	the exhortation
of us
[is] not
310606	of
error
nor
310610	of
impurity
nor
310614	in
trickery
but
just as
we have been approved
310620	by
310622	-
God
to be entrusted with
310626	the
gospel
so
we speak
not
as
men
pleasing
but
God
the [One]
examining
310639	the
310641	hearts
of us
Never
for
at any time
310647	with
310649	word
of flattery
were we
just as
you know
nor
310656	with
310658	a pretext
for greed
God [is]
witness
nor
seeking
310665	from
men
glory
nor
310670	from
you
nor
310674	from
others
[though] having authority
310678	with
weight
to be
as
310683	Christâs
apostles
But
we were
gentle
310689	in
310691	[the] midst
of you
as
if
a nursing mother
would cherish
310698	-
310700	her own
children
So
yearning over
you
we were pleased
to have imparted
to you
not
310710	only
310712	the
310714	gospel
310716	-
of God
but
310720	also
310722	our
310724	own
lives
because
beloved
to us
you have become
You remember
for
brothers
310734	the
310736	labor
of us
and
310740	-
hardship
Night
and
day
working
310747	in order
-
not
to burden
310752	anyone
of you
we proclaimed
310756	to
you
310759	the
310761	gospel
310763	-
of God
You [are]
witnesses
and
310769	-
God
310772	how
holily
and
righteously
and
blamelessly
toward you
those
believing
we were
just as
you know
how
310787	one
each
of you
as
a father
310793	children
his own
exhorting
you
and
comforting
and
charging
310802	unto
-
to walk
you
worthily
310808	-
of God
who
calls
you
310814	into
310816	the
310818	of Himself
kingdom
and
glory
And
310824	because of
this
310827	also
we
give thanks
310831	-
to God
unceasingly
that
having received
310838	[the] word
310840	[by your] hearing
310842	from
us
310845	-
of God
you accepted
not
310850	[the] word
of men
but
even as
truly
it is
310857	[the] word
of God
which
also
works
310863	in
you
who
believe
You
for
310870	imitators
became
brothers
310874	of the
310876	churches
310878	-
of God
-
being
310883	in
310885	-
Judea
310888	in
Christ
Jesus
For
310893	the same
as them
suffered
310897	also
you
310900	from
310902	the
310904	own
countrymen
as
310908	also [did]
they
310911	from
310913	the
Jews
who
both
310918	the
Lord
having killed
Jesus
and
310924	their own
prophets
and
us
having driven out
and
God
not
pleasing
and
310935	all
men
[who are] set against
hindering
us
310941	to the
Gentiles
to speak
that
they might be saved
310947	so as
-
to fill up
310951	their
310953	-
sins
always
Has come
now
310959	upon
them
310962	the
wrath
310965	to the
utmost
We
however
brothers
having been bereaved
310972	of
you
310975	for
310977	[the] time
of an hour
310980	in face
310982	not
in heart
more abundantly
were eager
310987	the
310989	face
of you
to see
310993	with
310995	great
desire
Therefore
we wanted
to come
311001	to
you
I
indeed
Paul
both
once
and
twice
and
hindered
us
311014	-
Satan
Who [is]
for
311019	our
hope
or
joy
or
311025	crown
of boasting
Or
[are] not
311030	even
you
311033	before
311035	the
311037	Lord
of us
Jesus
311041	at
311043	-
311045	His
coming
You
for
are
311051	the
311053	glory
of us
and
311057	-
joy
Therefore
no longer
enduring
we thought it best
to be left behind
311065	in
Athens
alone
and
we sent
Timothy
311072	the
311074	brother
of us
and
311079	fellow worker
311081	-
of God
311084	in
311086	the
311088	gospel
311090	-
of Christ
311093	in order
-
to strengthen
you
and
to encourage
311100	concerning
311102	the
311104	faith
of you
that
no one
be moved
311110	in
311113	the
tribulations
these
Yourselves
for
you know
that
311121	for
this
we are destined
And
indeed
when
311128	with
you
we were
we were telling beforehand
you
that
we are about
to suffer affliction
just as
also
it came to pass
and
you know
311142	Because of
this
I also
no longer
enduring
sent
311149	in order
-
to know
311153	the
311155	faith
of you
lest
somehow
had tempted
you
the [one]
tempting
and
311165	in
vain
would be
311169	the
311171	labor
of us
Presently
however
having come
Timothy
311178	to
us
311181	from
you
and
having brought good news
to us
311187	of the
faith
and
311191	the
311193	love
of you
and
that
you have
311200	a remembrance
of us
good
always
longing
us
to see
just as
311209	also
we
you
311213	because of
this
we were encouraged
brothers
311218	as to
you
311221	in
311223	all
311225	the
311227	distress
and
tribulation
of us
311232	through
311234	-
311236	your
faith
For
now
we live
if
you
are standing firm
311245	in
[the] Lord
311248	What
for
thanksgiving
are we able
311253	-
to God
to give
311257	concerning
you
311260	in return for
311262	all
311264	the
joy
that
we rejoice
311269	because of
you
311272	before
311274	the
311276	God
of us
night
and
day
exceedingly
imploring
311284	for [us]
-
to see
311288	your
311290	-
face
and
to supply
311295	the things
311297	lacking
311299	in the
311301	faith
of you
311304	Himself
now
311307	the
311309	God
and
Father
of us
and
311315	the
311317	Lord
of us
Jesus
may direct
311322	the
311324	way
of us
311327	to
you
You
now
311332	the
Lord
may make to increase
and
to abound
311338	-
311340	in love
311342	toward
one another
and
311346	toward
all
just as
311350	also
we
311353	toward
you
311356	in order
-
to strengthen
311360	your
311362	-
hearts
blameless
311366	in
holiness
311369	before
311371	the
311373	God
and
Father
of us
311378	at
311380	the
311383	coming
311385	of the
311387	Lord
of us
Jesus
311391	with
311393	all
311395	the
311397	saints
of Him
Finally
then
brothers
we implore
you
and
exhort
311407	in
[the] Lord
Jesus
that
just as
you have received
311414	from
us
-
in what manner
it behooves
you
to walk
and
to please
God
just as
even
you walk [now]
so
you should abound
more
You know
for
311433	what
instructions
we gave
you
311438	through
311440	the
Lord
Jesus
This
for
is
311447	[the] will
311449	-
of God
311452	the
311454	sanctification
of you
To abstain
you [are]
311459	from
311461	-
sexual immorality
to know
311465	each
of you [how]
311468	the
311470	of himself
vessel
to control
311474	in
holiness
and
honor
not
311480	in
311482	[the] passion
of lust
as
311486	also
311488	the
Gentiles
-
not
knowing
311494	-
God
-
not
to go beyond
and
to overreach
311502	in
311504	the
matter
311507	the
311509	brother
of him
because
avenging [is]
[the] Lord
311515	concerning
311517	all
these things
just as
also
we told before
you
and
thoroughly warned
Not
for
has called
us
311530	-
God
311533	to
impurity
but
311537	into
holiness
So then
the [one]
rejecting [this]
not
man
disregards
but
311547	-
God
the [One]
also
giving
311553	the
311556	Spirit
of Him
311559	-
Holy
311562	to
you
311565	Concerning
now
311568	-
brotherly love
no
need
you have [for me]
to write
to you
311576	yourselves
for
you
taught by God
are
311582	in order
-
to love
one another
And
for
you are doing
this
311591	toward
311593	all
311595	the
311597	brothers
311599	in
311601	all
311603	-
Macedonia
We exhort
however
you
brothers
to abound
more and more
and
to strive earnestly
to live quietly
and
to attend to
311617	the
own
and
to work with
311622	the
311624	hands
of you
just as
you
we commanded
so that
you may walk
properly
311633	toward
311635	those

brothers
311649	concerning
those
having fallen asleep
so that
not
you should be grieved
just as
311657	also
311659	the
rest
those
not

If
for
we believe
that
Jesus
died

rose again
so
also
311676	-
God
those
having fallen asleep
311681	through

Jesus
will bring
311687	with
Him
This
for
to you
we declare
311694	in
311696	[the] word
of [the] Lord
that
we
the

remaining
311705	unto
311707	the
311709	coming
311711	of the
Lord
311714	no

shall precede
those

because
311721	Himself
311723	the
Lord
311726	with
a loud command
311729	with
311731	the voice
of an archangel
and
311735	with
311737	[the] trumpet
of God
will descend
311741	from
heaven
and
311745	the
311747	dead
311749	in
Christ
will rise
first
Then
we
the
living
-
remaining
together
311761	with
them
will be caught away
311765	in
[the] clouds
311768	for
311771	[the] meeting
311773	of the
Lord
311776	in
[the] air
and
so
always
311782	with
[the] Lord
we will be
Therefore
encourage
one another
311789	with
311792	the
words
these
311796	Concerning
now
311799	the
times
and
311803	the
seasons
brothers
no
need
you have
to you
to be written
Yourselves
for
fully
you know
that
311817	[the] day
of [the] Lord
as
a thief
311822	by
night
in this manner
comes
For when
they might say
Peace
and
security
then
311833	suddenly
upon them
comes
destruction
as
311839	the
labor pains
to her
311843	in
womb
having
and
311848	no
not
shall they escape
You
however
brothers
not
are
311857	in
darkness
that
311861	the
day
you
like
a thief
should overtake
311868	All
for
you
311872	sons
of light
are
and
311877	sons
of day
Not
we are
of night
nor
of darkness
So
then
not
we should sleep
as
311890	the
others
but
we should watch
and
we should be sober
Those
for
sleeping
by night
sleep
and
those
becoming drunk
by night
get drunk
We
however
of [the] day
being
should be sober
having put on
311913	[the] breastplate
of faith
and
love
and
311919	[the] helmet
311921	[the] hope
of salvation
because
not
has destined
us
311928	-
God
311931	for
wrath
but
311935	for
311937	obtaining
salvation
311940	through
311942	the
311944	Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
the [One]
having died
311951	for
us
so that
whether
we might watch
or
we might sleep
together
311960	with
Him
we may live
Therefore
encourage
one another
and
build up
one
311970	-
another
just as
also
you are doing
We implore
however
you
brothers
to appreciate
those
toiling
311983	among
you
and
taking the lead
over you
311989	in
[the] Lord
and
admonishing
you
and
to esteem
them
exceedingly
311999	in
love
312002	because of
312004	the
312006	work
of them
Be at peace
312010	among
yourselves
We exhort
now
you
brothers
to admonish
312018	the
unruly
encourage
312022	the
fainthearted
help
312026	the
weak
be patient
312030	toward
all
See that
no
one
evil
312037	for
evil
to anyone
has repaid
but
always
312044	the
good

312048	toward
one another
and
312052	toward
all
Always

Unceasingly

everything

you
312075	The

We implore
now
you
brothers
312532	by
312534	the
312536	coming
312538	of the
312540	Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
and
312547	our
gathering together

Him
312553	for

not

to be shaken
you

nor
to be troubled
neither

spirit
nor
312572	by

312580	as if
312582	by
us
as
that
is present
312588	the
312590	day
312592	of the
Lord
No
one
you
should deceive
312599	in
312601	not one
way
because [it is]
if
not [until]
shall have come
312608	the
apostasy
first
and
shall have been revealed
312614	the
312616	man
312618	-
of lawlessness
312621	the
312623	son
312625	-
of destruction
the [one]
opposing
and
exalting himself
312632	above
312634	every
so-called
god
or
object of worship
so as for
him
312642	in
312644	the
312646	temple
312648	-
of God
to sit down
setting forth
he himself
that
is
God
Not
do you remember
that
yet
being
312662	with
you
these things
I was saying
to you
And
now
that which
is restraining
you know
312673	for
-
to be revealed
him
312678	in
312680	-
312682	his
time
312685	The
for
312688	mystery
already
is working
312692	-
of lawlessness
only [there is]
the [one]
restraining [it]
at present
until
312700	out of
[the] midst
he might be [gone]
And
then
will be revealed
312707	the
lawless [one]
whom
312711	the
Lord
Jesus
will slay
312716	with the
312718	breath
312720	of the
312722	mouth
of Him
and
will annul
312727	by the
312729	appearing
312731	of the
312733	coming
of Him
312736	whose
is
312739	-
coming
312742	according to
312744	[the] working
312746	-
of Satan
312749	in
312751	every
power
and
in signs
and
312757	in wonders
of falsehood
and
312761	in
312763	every
312765	deceit
of wickedness
unto those
perishing
312770	in return for
which
312773	the
312775	love
312777	of the
truth
not
they received
312782	in order for
-
to be saved
them
And
312788	because of
this
will send
to them
312793	-
God
312796	a working
of delusion
312799	for
-
to believe
them
312804	what
[is] false
in order that
should be judged
312809	all
those
not
having believed
312814	the
truth
but
having delighted
312819	-
in unrighteousness
We
however
ought
to give thanks
312826	-
to God
always
312830	concerning
you
312833	brothers
beloved
312836	by
[the] Lord
that
has chosen
you
312842	-
God
312845	from
[the] beginning
312848	unto
salvation
312851	in
312853	[the] sanctification
of [the] Spirit
and
312857	[by] faith
of [the] truth
312860	to
this
also
He called
you
312866	through
312868	the
312870	gospel
of us
312873	to
312875	[the] obtaining
312877	of [the] glory
312879	of the
312881	Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
So
then
brothers
stand firm
and
hold fast
312892	to the
traditions
that
you were taught
whether
312898	by
word
or
312902	by
312904	letter
from us
312907	Himself
now
312910	the
312912	Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
and
312918	-
God
312921	the
312923	Father
of us
the [One]
having loved
us
and
having given [us]
312931	comfort
eternal
and
312935	hope
good
312938	by
grace
may He encourage
312942	your
312944	-
hearts
and
may He strengthen [them]
312949	in
312951	every
312953	work
and
word
good
312958	-
Finally
pray
brothers
312963	for
us
that
312967	the
312969	word
312971	of the
Lord
may spread quickly
and
may be glorified
just as
312978	also
312980	with
you
and
that
we may be delivered
312986	from
312988	-
312990	perverse
and
evil
men
not
for
all [are]
312998	of the
faith
Faithful
however
is
313004	the
Lord
who
will strengthen
you
and
will keep [you]
313012	from
313014	-
evil
We are persuaded
now
313019	in
[the] Lord
313022	as to
you
that
the things that
we command
both
you are doing
and
you will do
313032	-
And
the Lord
may direct
313037	your
313039	-
hearts
313042	into
313044	the
313046	love
313048	-
of God
and
313052	into
313054	the
313056	steadfastness
313058	-
of Christ
We command
now
you
brothers
313065	in
313067	[the] name
313069	of the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
are to withdraw
you
313076	from
313078	every
313080	brother
idly
walking
and
not
313086	according to
313088	the
tradition
that
you received
313093	from
us
Yourselves
for
you know
how
it behooves [you]
to imitate
us
because
not
we were idle
313106	among
you
nor
without payment
bread
did we eat
313113	from
anyone
but
313117	in
labor
and
hardship
night
and
day
working
313126	in order
-
not
to be burdensome to
313131	any
of you
not
that
not
we have
[the] right
but
that
ourselves
[as] an example
we may offer
to you
313145	for
-
you to imitate
us
Even
for
when
we were
313154	with
you
this
we were commanding
you
that
if
anyone
not
is willing
to work
neither
let him eat
We hear
for
some
are walking
313172	among
you
idly
not at all
working
but

313180	To
now
such
we warn
and
exhort
313187	by
our Lord
Jesus
Christ
so that
313193	with
quietness
working
313197	-
313199	their own
bread
they may eat
You
now
brothers
not
shall grow weary
[in] well-doing
If
then
anyone
not
obey
313214	this
313217	instruction
of us
313220	through
313222	the
letter
of this [man]
take note
not
to mix with
him
so that
he may be ashamed
And yet
not
as
an enemy
esteem [him]
but
admonish [him]
as
a brother
313241	Himself
now
313244	the
313246	Lord
313248	-
of peace
may give
you
313253	-
peace
313256	through
all
313259	in
313261	every
way
313264	The
Lord [be]
313267	with
313269	all
of you
313272	The
greeting
313275	-
313277	in my own
313279	hand
Paul
which
is
[my] sign
313285	in
313287	every
letter
In this manner
I write
313292	The
313294	grace
313296	of the
313298	Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
313303	[be] with
313305	all
of you
Paul
313310	an apostle
of Christ

313314	according to
313316	[the] command
of God
313319	[the] Savior
of us
and
of Christ
Jesus
313325	the
313327	hope
of us
To Timothy
313332	[my] true
child
313335	in
[the] faith
Grace

[and] peace
313341	from
God
[the] Father
and
Christ
Jesus
313348	the
313350	Lord
of us
Just as
I urged
you
to remain
313357	in
Ephesus
[when] I was going
313361	to
Macedonia
so that
you might warn
certain men
not
to teach other doctrines
nor
to give heed
to myths
and
313373	genealogies
endless
which
speculations
bring
rather
than
313381	stewardship
of God
313384	which [is]
313386	in
faith
313389	-
And
313392	the goal
313394	of [our]
instruction
is
313398	love
313400	out of
313402	a pure
heart
and
313406	a conscience
good
and
313410	a faith
sincere
from which
some
having missed the mark
have turned aside
313417	to
meaningless discourse
desiring
to be
teachers of the Law
not
understanding
neither
what
they are saying
nor
313429	[that] about
which
they confidently assert
We know
now
that
good [is]
313437	the
law
if
one
it
lawfully
uses
knowing
this
that
for a righteous [one]
law
not
is enacted
for [the] lawless
however
and
insubordinate
for [the] ungodly
and
sinful
for [the] unholy
and
profane
for murderers of fathers
and
murderers of mothers
for slayers of man
for the sexually immoral
homosexuals
enslavers
liars
perjurers
and
if
313473	anything
other
313476	in the
313478	being sound
313480	teaching
is opposed to
313483	according to
313485	the
313487	gospel
313489	of the
313491	glory
313493	of the
313495	blessed
God
with which
have been entrusted
I
Thankfulness
I have
for the [One]
having strengthened
me
Christ
Jesus
313508	the
313510	Lord
of us
that
faithful
me
He esteemed
having appointed [me]
313518	to
service
313521	-
formerly
being
a blasphemer
and
a persecutor
and
insolent
but
I was shown mercy
because
being ignorant
I did [it]
313535	in
unbelief
Surpassingly increased
then
313540	the
313542	grace
313544	of the
313546	Lord
of us
313549	with
[the] faith
and
love
313554	that [are]
313556	in
Christ
Jesus
Trustworthy [is]
313561	the
saying
and
313566	of full
acceptance
worthy
that
Christ
Jesus
came
313574	into
313576	the
world
sinners
to save
313581	of whom
[the] foremost
am
I
But
313587	because of
this
I was shown mercy
that
313592	in
me
[the] foremost
might display
Jesus
Christ
313599	-
313601	perfect
patience
313604	as
313606	a pattern
for those
being about
to believe
313611	on
Him
313614	to
313616	life
eternal
313619	To
now
313622	[the] King
313624	of the
ages
313627	[the] immortal

God
[be] honor
and
glory
313635	to
313637	the
313639	ages
313641	of the
ages
Amen
313645	This
313647	-
charge
I commit
to you
[my] child
Timothy
313654	according to
313656	the
313658	going before
313660	as to
you
prophecies
that
you might war
313666	by
them
313669	the
313671	good
warfare
holding
faith
and
313677	a good
conscience
which
some
having cast away
313683	concerning
313685	the
faith
have caused a shipwreck
among whom
are
Hymenaeus
and
Alexander
whom
I have handed over
313696	-
to Satan
that
they may be disciplined
not
to blaspheme
I exhort
therefore
313705	first
of all
to be made
entreaties
prayers
intercessions
[and] thanksgivings
313713	on behalf of
313715	all
men
313718	for
kings
and
313722	all
those
313725	in
authority
being
so that
313730	a tranquil
and
quiet
life
we may lead
313736	in
313738	all
godliness
and
dignity
This
[is] good
and
acceptable
313747	before
313749	the
313751	Savior
of us
God
who
313756	all
men
desires
to be saved
and
313762	to
313764	[the] knowledge
of [the] truth
to come
One
for
God [there is]
one
313772	then
313774	mediator
between God
and
men
[the] man
Christ
Jesus
the [One]
having given
Himself
[as] a ransom
313786	for
all
313789	the
testimony
313792	in proper times
their own
313795	in regard to
which
was appointed
I
a herald
and
an apostle
[the] truth
I am speaking
not
I do lie
313808	a teacher
of [the] Gentiles
313811	in
faith
and
truth
I desire
therefore
to pray
313819	the
men
313822	in
313824	every
place
lifting up
313828	holy
hands
313831	apart from
anger
and
dissension
Likewise
women
313838	in
313840	apparel
respectable
313843	with
modesty
and
self-control
should adorn
themselves
not
313851	with
braided hair
or
gold
or
pearls
or
313859	clothing
costly
but
313863	with what
is becoming
313866	to women
professing
[the] fear of God
through
313871	works
good
A woman
313875	in
quietness
let learn
313879	in
313881	all
submissiveness
To teach
however
a woman
not
I do permit
nor
to use authority over
a man
but
to be
313894	in
quietness
Adam
for
first
was formed
then
Eve
And
Adam
not
was deceived
313907	-
but
the woman
having been deceived
313912	into
transgression
has come
She will be saved
however
313918	through
313920	-
childbearing
if
they abide
313925	in
faith
and
love
and
holiness
313932	with
self-restraint
Trustworthy [is]
313936	the
saying
If
anyone
overseership
aspires to
313943	of good
a work
he is desirous
It behooves
therefore
313949	the
overseer
above reproach
to be
313955	of one
wife
[the] husband
sober
self-controlled
respectable
hospitable
able to teach
313964	not
given to wine
not
a striker
but
gentle
peaceable
not loving money
313973	the
313975	own
house
well
managing
children
having
313982	in
submission
313985	with
313987	all
dignity
if
but
one
313993	the
313995	own
household
to manage
not
knows
how
314002	[the] church
of God
[how] will he care for
not
a novice
that
not
having been puffed up
314011	into
314013	[the] judgment
he might fall
314016	of the
devil
It behooves [him]
now
also
314022	a testimony
good
to have
314026	from
314028	those
outside
so that
not
314033	into
reproach
he might fall
and
314038	[the] snare
314040	of the
devil
Deacons
likewise
[must be] dignified
314046	not
double-tongued
not
314050	to wine
much
being given
314054	not
greedy of dishonest gain
holding
314058	to the
314060	mystery
314062	of the
faith
314065	with
314067	clear
a conscience
314070	Also
these
now
let them be tested
first
then
let them serve
blameless
being
Women
likewise
[must be] dignified
314083	not
slanderers
clear-minded
314087	faithful
314089	in
all things
Deacons
let be
314095	of one
wife
husbands
[their] children
well
managing
and
314103	the
314105	own
households
Those
for
well
having served
314112	a standing
for themselves
good
acquire
and
314118	great
confidence
314121	in
[the] faith
314124	that [is]
314126	in
Christ
Jesus
These things
to you
I am writing
hoping
to come
314135	to
you
a short time
if
however
I should delay
so that
you may know
how
it behooves [one]
314146	in
314148	[the] household
of God
to conduct oneself
which
is
314154	[the] church
314156	of God
[the] living
314159	[the] pillar
and
base
314163	of the
truth
And
confessedly
great
is
314170	the
314173	-
of godliness
mystery
Who
was revealed
314179	in
[the] flesh
was justified
314183	in
[the] Spirit
was seen
by angels
was proclaimed
314189	among
[the] nations
was believed on
314193	in
[the] world
was taken up
314197	in
glory
314200	-
But
the Spirit
expressly
states
that
314207	in
314209	later
times
will depart from
some
314214	the
faith
giving heed
314218	to spirits
deceitful
and
314222	teachings
of demons
314225	in
314227	hypocrisy
314229	of speakers of lies
having been seared
314232	in the
314234	own
conscience
forbidding
to marry
[commanding] to abstain
from foods
that
314242	-
God
created
314246	for
314249	reception
314251	with
thanksgiving
314254	by the
faithful
and
[those] knowing
314259	the
truth
For
314263	every
314265	creature
of God
[is] good
and
nothing [is]
to be rejected
314272	with
thanksgiving
being received
it is sanctified
for
314278	by
314280	[the] word
of God
and
prayer
These things
laying before
314287	the
brothers
314290	good
you will be
314293	a servant
of Christ
Jesus
being nourished
314298	in the
314300	words
314302	of the
faith
and
314306	of the
314308	good
teaching
that
you have closely followed
314313	-
But
314316	profane
and
silly
fables
refuse
Train
rather
yourself
314325	to
godliness
314328	-
For
314331	bodily
exercise
314334	of
a little
is
profit
314339	-
but
godliness
314343	for
everything
profitable
is
314348	[the] promise
holding
314351	of life
314353	of the
present
and
of the [one]
coming
Trustworthy [is]
314360	the
saying
and
314365	of full
acceptance
worthy
314369	For
this
for
we toil
and
strive
because
we have hope
314378	on
314380	God
[the] living
who
is
314385	[the] Savior
314387	of all
men
314390	especially
of believers
Command
these things
and
teach
No one
314398	your
314400	-
youth
let despise
but
314405	a pattern
be
314408	for the

314414	in
conduct
314417	in
love
314420	in
faith
314423	in
purity
Until
I come
give heed
314429	to the
public reading of Scripture
314432	to
exhortation
314435	to
teaching
Not
be negligent
314440	of the
314443	in
you
gift
which
was given
to you
314450	through
prophecy

314455	[the] laying on
314457	of the

314471	your
314473	-
progress
evident
may be

Give heed
to yourself
and
314482	to the

let be enrolled
314619	not

314657	Younger
however
widows
refuse
when
for
they might grow wanton against

Christ
to marry

incurring
judgment

idle

the things

not
they will endure

316631	according to
316633	the

the things that
are consistent with

ungodliness
and
317518	-
317520	worldly
passions
discreetly

righteously

of us
Christ
Jesus
who
gave
Himself
317562	for
us
that
He might redeem
us
317568	from
317570	all
lawlessness
and
might purify
to Himself
317576	a people
specially chosen
317579	zealous
317581	of good

These things
speak
and
exhort
and
rebuke
317590	with
317592	all
authority
No one
you
let despise
Remind
them
to rulers
to authorities
to be subject
to be obedient
317604	for
317606	every

pleasures
various
317642	in
malice

one another
When
however
317654	the
kindness
and
317658	the
love of mankind
appeared
317662	of the
317664	Savior
of us
God
not
317669	by
works
317672	-
317674	in
righteousness
that
did
we
but
317681	according to
317683	-
317685	His
mercy
He saved
us
317690	through
317692	[the] washing

317696	renewing
317698	of [the] Spirit

us
richly
317707	through

so that
having been justified

Trustworthy [is]
317733	the

317737	concerning
these things
I want
you
to affirm strongly
so that
may take care

These things
are

however

avoid

boldness
having
to order
you
what [is]
befitting
318042	for the sake of
318044	-

rather
I exhort [you]

318051	as
Paul
aged
now
then
318057	also
318059	a prisoner
of Christ

I exhort
you
318065	for
318067	-
318069	my
child
318072	whom
I have begotten
318075	in
318077	-
chains
Onesimus
318081	-
318083	once
318085	to you
useless
318088	now
however
318091	both
to you
and
to me
useful
318097	whom
I have sent back
to you
in person
he who
is
318104	-
318106	my
very heart
whom
I
was wishing
318112	with
myself
to keep
so that
318117	on behalf of
you
me
he might serve
318122	in
318124	the
318126	chains
318128	of the
gospel
318131	Apart from
however
318134	-
318136	your
consent
nothing
I wished
to do
so that
not
318144	as
318146	according to
necessity
318149	the
318151	good
of you
may be
but
318156	according to
willingness
Perhaps
for
318161	because of
this
he was separated [from you]
318165	for
a time
so that
eternally
him
you might possess
no longer
318173	as
a slave
but
318177	above
a slave
318180	a brother
beloved
especially
to me
318185	how much
however
more
to you
both
318191	in
[the] flesh
and
318195	in
[the] Lord
If
therefore
me
you consider
a partner
receive
him
as
me
If
however
in any way
he has wronged
you
or
he owes [you]
this
to me
charge
I
Paul
did write
318220	with
318222	my own
hand
I
will repay [it]
that
not
I may say
to you
that
318232	even
yourself
to me
you owe also
Yes
brother
I
from you
may have profit
318242	in
[the] Lord
Refresh
318246	my
318248	-
heart
318251	in
Christ
Being persuaded of
318255	the
318257	obedience
of you
I write
to you
knowing
that
318264	even
318266	above
what
I say
you will do
318271	At the same time
now
also
prepare
for me
a lodging
I hope
for
that
318281	through
318283	the
318285	prayers
of you
I will be granted
to you

318296	fellow prisoner

Aristarchus
Demas
[and] Luke
318307	the
318309	fellow workers
of me
318312	The
318314	grace
318316	of the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
318321	[be] with
318323	the
318325	spirit
of you
In many portions
and
in many ways
long ago
318332	-
God
having spoken
318336	to the
fathers
318339	in
318341	the
prophets
318344	in
318346	last
318349	-
days
these
has spoken
to us
318355	in
[His] Son
whom
He appointed
318360	heir
of all things
318363	through
whom
also
He made
318368	the
ages
who
being
318373	[the] radiance
318375	of [His]
glory
and
318379	[the] exact expression
318381	of the
318383	substance
of Him
upholding
then
318388	-
all things
318391	by the
318393	word
318395	of the
318397	power
of Himself
318400	[the] purification
318402	-
of sins
having made
sat down
318407	at
318409	[the] right hand
318411	of the
Majesty
318414	on
high
By so much
superior
having become
318420	to the
angels
as much as
318424	more excellent
318426	beyond
theirs
He has inherited
a name
318431	To which
for
did He say
ever
318436	of the
angels
318439	Son
of me
are
You
I
today
have begotten
You
And
again
I
will be
to Him
318453	for
a Father
and
He
will be
to Me
318460	for
a Son
When
then
again
He brings
318467	the
Firstborn
318470	into
318472	the
world
He says
And
let worship
Him
318479	all
318481	[the] angels
of God
And
318485	as to
indeed
318488	the
angels
He says
The [One]
making
318494	the
318496	angels
of Him
winds
and
318501	the
318503	ministers
of Him
318506	of fire
a flame
318509	Unto
however
318512	the
Son
318515	The
318517	throne
of You
318520	O
God
318523	[is] to
318525	the
318527	age
318529	of the
age
and
318533	the
318535	scepter
318537	of
righteousness [is]
318540	[the] scepter
318542	of the
318544	kingdom
of You
You have loved
righteousness
and
have hated
wickedness
318552	because of
this
has anointed
You
318557	-
God
318560	the
318562	God
of You
318565	with [the] oil
of exultation
318568	above
318570	the
318572	companions
of You
And
You
318577	in
[the] beginning
Lord
318581	of the
earth
laid the foundation
and
318586	works
318588	of the
318590	hands
of You
are
318594	the
heavens
They
will perish
You
however
remain
and
all
like
a garment
will grow old
and
like
a robe
You will roll up
them
like
a garment
also
they will be changed
You
however
318618	the
same
are
and
318623	the
318625	years
of You
not
will never end
318630	To
318632	which
now
318635	of the
angels
did He say
ever
Sit
318641	at
318643	[the] right hand
of Me
until
-
I may place
318649	the
318651	enemies
of You
318654	[as] a footstool
318656	for the
318658	feet
of You
Not
all
are they
318664	ministering
318666	spirits
318668	for
service
being sent forth
318672	for the sake of
those
being about
to inherit
salvation
318678	Because of
this
it behooves
more abundantly
to give heed
us
to the things
we have heard
lest
ever
we should drift away
If
for
318692	the
318695	by
angels
having been spoken
word
was
unalterable
and
318703	every
transgression
and
disobedience
received
318709	a just
recompense
how
we
will escape
318715	such a great
having neglected
a salvation
which
a commencement
having received
declared
318723	by
318725	the
Lord
318728	by
those
having heard
318732	to
us
it was confirmed
bearing witness
318737	-
God
by signs
together with [them]
and
wonders
and
318745	by various
miracles
and
318750	of [the] Spirit
Holy
distributions
318754	according to
318756	the
318758	of Him
will
Not
for
to angels
did He subject
318765	the
world
that
is coming
318770	of
which
we are speaking
Has testified
however
somewhere
someone
saying
What
is
man
that
You are mindful
of him
or
318786	[the] son
of man
that
You care for
him
You made lower
him
318794	a little
some
318797	than
[the] angels
with glory
and
honor
You crowned
him
all things
You have put in subjection
318807	under
318809	the
318811	feet
of him
318814	In
-
for
subjecting
to him
318820	-
all things
nothing
He left
318825	to him
unsubject
At present
however
not yet
do we see
to Him
318833	-
all things
having been subjected
Who
however
318839	a little
one
318842	than
[the] angels
having been made lower
we see
Jesus
318848	because of
318850	the
318852	suffering
318854	-
of death
with glory
and
with honor
having been crowned
so that
318862	by [the] grace
of God
318865	for
everyone
He might taste
death
It was fitting
for
to Him
318873	for
whom [are]
318876	-
all things
and
318880	by
whom [are]
318883	-
all things
318886	many
sons
318889	to
glory
having brought
318893	the
318895	archetype
318897	of the
318899	salvation
of them
318902	through
sufferings
to make perfect
The [One]
both
for
sanctifying
and
those
being sanctified
318914	of
one
[are] all
318918	for
318920	which
reason
not
He is ashamed
brothers
them
to call
saying
I will declare
318930	the
318932	name
of You
318935	to the
318937	brothers
of Me
318940	in
318942	[the] midst
of [the] congregation
I will sing praises
of you
And
again
I
318950	will be
trusting
318953	in
Him
And
again
Behold
I
and
318961	the
children
whom
to Me
has given
318967	-
God
Since
therefore
318972	the
children
have partaken
of blood
and
of flesh
318979	also
He
likewise
took part in
318984	the
same things
so that
318988	through
318990	[His]
death
He might destroy
the [one]
318995	the
318997	power
holding
319000	-
of death
that
is
319005	the
devil
and
might set free
those
who
319012	fear
of death
319015	through
319017	all
[their time]
to live
319021	subject
were
to slavery
Not
for
surely
[the] angels
He helps
but
319031	[the] seed
of Abraham
He helps
Therefore
it behooved [Him]
319037	in
all things
319040	[His]
brothers
to be made like
so that
319045	a merciful
He might become
and
faithful
high priest
319051	[in] things
319053	relating to
319055	-
God
319058	in order
-
to make propitiation for
319062	the
319064	sins
319066	of the
people
319069	In
that
for
has suffered
He Himself
having been tempted
He is able
those
being tempted
to help
Therefore
319081	brothers
holy
319085	of [the] calling
heavenly
partakers
carefully consider
319090	the
319092	apostle
and
high priest
319096	of the
319098	confession
of us
319101	Jesus
faithful
being
to the [One]
having appointed
Him
as
319109	also
Moses
319112	in
319114	all
319116	the
319118	house
of Him
319121	Of greater
for
He
glory
319126	than
Moses
has been counted worthy
319130	by
so much as
319133	greater
honor
has
319137	than the
house [itself]
the [one]
having built
it
319143	Every
for
house
is built
319148	by
someone
the [One]
however
everything
having built [is]
God
And
Moses
indeed
[was] faithful
319160	in
319162	all
319164	the
319166	house
of Him
319169	as
a servant
319172	unto
319174	a testimony
of the things
going to be spoken
Christ
however
319180	as
[the] Son
319183	over
319185	the
319187	house
of Him
319190	whose
house
are
we
if indeed
319196	[our]
confidence
and
319200	the
319202	boast
319204	of [our]
hope
319207	unto
[the] end
firm
we should hold
Therefore
just as
says
319215	the
319217	Spirit
319219	-
Holy
Today
if
319224	the
319226	voice
of Him
you should hear
not
harden
319232	the
319234	hearts
of you
as
319238	in
319240	the
rebellion
319243	in
319245	the
319247	day
319249	-
of testing
319252	in
319254	the
wilderness
where
tried [Me]
319259	the
319261	fathers
of you
319264	by
testing
and
saw
319269	the
319271	works
of Me
319274	forty
years
Therefore
I was angry
319280	with the
generation
that
and
I said
Always
they go astray
319288	-
in the heart
of them
and
not
have they known
319295	the
319297	ways
of Me
so
I swore
319302	in
319304	the
319306	wrath
of Me
[not]
shall they enter
319311	into
319313	the
319315	rest
of Me
Take heed
brothers
lest
ever
there will be
319323	in
319325	any
of you
319329	a heart
evil
of unbelief
319333	into
-
falling away
319337	from
319339	God
[the] living
But
encourage
other
319345	each
319347	every
day
319350	while
-
319353	-
today
it is called
so that
not
may be hardened
319360	one
319362	of
you
319365	by [the] deceitfulness
319367	-
of sin
319370	Partakers
for
319373	-
of Christ
we have become
if indeed
319378	from the
319380	beginning
319382	the
assurance
319385	unto
[the] end
firm
we should hold
319390	As
-
it is said
Today
if
319396	the
319398	voice
of Him
you should hear
not
harden
319404	the
319406	hearts
of you
as
319410	in
319412	the
rebellion
Who
for
[were those] having heard
rebelled
but
not
319421	all
those
having come
319425	out of
Egypt
319428	by the leading of
Moses
With whom
now
was He indignant
319434	forty
years
[if] not
with those
having sinned
319440	whose
319442	-
bodies
fell
319446	in
319448	the
wilderness
To whom
then
did He swear that
not
shall they enter
319456	into
319458	the
319460	rest
of Him
if
not
to those
having disobeyed
And
we see
that
not
they were able
to enter in
319473	because of
unbelief
We should fear
therefore
lest
ever
left remaining
of the promise
to enter
319483	into
319485	the
319487	rest
of Him
should seem
319491	any
319493	of
you
to have fallen short
And
for
319499	we are [those]
having had the gospel preached
just as
they [did]
but
not
did profit
319507	the
319509	message
319511	of [their]
hearing
them
not
having been united with
319517	the
faith
of those
having heard
We enter
for
319524	into
319526	the
rest
those
having believed
as
He has said
So
I swore
319535	in
319537	the
319539	wrath
of me
Not
shall they enter
319544	into
319546	the
319548	rest
of Me
And yet
319552	the
works
319555	from
319557	[the] foundation
of [the] world
have been finished
He has spoken
for
somewhere
319564	concerning
319566	the
seventh [day]
in this way
And
rested
319572	-
God
319575	on
319577	the
319579	day
319581	-
seventh
319584	from
319586	all
319588	the
319590	works
of Him
And
319594	in
this [passage]
again
[Not]
shall they enter
319600	into
319602	the
319604	rest
of Me
Since
therefore
it remains [for]
some
to enter
319612	into
it
and
those
formerly
having received the good news
not
did enter in
319621	because of
disobedience
again
319625	a certain
He appoints
day
Today
319630	through
David
saying
319634	after
319636	so long
a time
just as
it has been said
Today
if
319643	the
319645	voice
of Him
you shall hear
not
harden
319651	the
319653	hearts
of you
If
for
to them
Joshua
had given rest
not
-
319663	about
319665	another
He would have spoken
319668	after
this
day
So then
there remains
a Sabbath rest
319675	for the
319677	people
319679	-
of God
The [one]
for
having entered
319685	into
319687	the
319689	rest
of Him
319692	also
he
rested
319696	from
319698	the
319700	works
of him
as
319704	from
319706	the
own
319709	-
God [did]
We should be diligent
therefore
to enter
319715	into
319717	that
319719	-
rest
so that
not
319724	by
319726	the
319728	same
anyone
319731	example
should fall
319734	-
of disobedience
Living [is]
for
319739	the
319741	word
319743	-
of God
and
active
and
319749	sharper
319751	than
319753	any
319755	sword
two-edged
even
penetrating
319760	as far as
319762	[the] division
of soul
and
spirit
of joints
and
also
marrows
and
319772	able to judge
319774	[the] thoughts
and
intentions
of [the] heart
And
not
there is
creature
hidden
319784	before
Him
all things
however
[are] uncovered
and
laid bare
319792	to the
319794	eyes
of Him
319797	to
whom
[is] our
319801	-
reckoning
Having
therefore
319807	a high priest
great
having passed through
319811	the
heavens
Jesus
319815	the
319817	Son
319819	-
of God
we should hold firmly
319823	to [our]
confession
319826	Not
for
have we
a high priest
not
being able
to sympathize
319834	with the
319836	weaknesses
of us
[one] having been tempted
however
319841	in
all things
319844	by
the same way
319847	without
sin
We should come
therefore
319852	with
boldness
319855	to the
319857	throne
319859	-
of grace
so that
we may receive
mercy
and
grace
may find
319868	for
319870	in time of need
help
319873	Every
for
319876	high priest
319878	from among
men
being taken
319882	on behalf of
men
is appointed
319886	in things
319888	relating to
319890	-
God
that
he should offer
gifts
both
and
sacrifices
319899	for
sins
to exercise forbearance
being able
with those
being ignorant
and
going astray
since
319909	also
he himself
is encompassed by
weakness
and
319915	because of
this
he is obligated
just as
319920	for
319922	the
people
so
319926	also
319928	for
himself
to offer sacrifices
319932	for
sins
And
not
upon himself
anyone
takes
319940	the
honor
but rather
being called
319945	by
319947	-
God
just as
319951	also
Aaron
So
319955	also
319957	-
Christ
not
Himself
did glorify
to become
a high priest
but
the [One]
having said
319968	to
Him
319971	Son
of Me
are
You
I
today
have begotten
You
Just as
319981	also
319983	in
another [place]
He says
You [are]
a priest
319989	to
319991	the
age
319994	according to
319996	the
319998	order
of Melchizedek
[He]
320002	in
320004	the
320006	days
320008	of the
320010	flesh
of Him
prayers
both
and
supplications
320017	to
the [One]
being able
to save
Him
320023	from
death
320026	with
320028	crying
loud
and
tears
having offered up
and
having been heard
320036	because of
320038	-
reverence
though
being
a Son
He learned
320045	from
the things
He suffered
320049	-
obedience
and
having been perfected
He became
320055	to all
those
obeying
Him
320060	[the] author
320062	of salvation
eternal
having been designated
320066	by
320068	-
God
320071	a high priest
320073	according to
320075	the
320077	order
of Melchizedek
320080	Concerning
this
[there is] much
from us
320085	-
speech
and
difficult in interpretation
to speak
since
sluggish
you have become
320094	in the
hearings
Even
for
you ought
to be
teachers
320102	by
320104	the
time
again
320108	need of
you have
[one]
to teach
you
what [is]
320115	the
320117	principles
320119	of the
320121	beginning
320123	of the
320125	oracles
320127	-
of God
and
you have become
320132	need
[those] having
of milk
320136	not
320138	of solid
food
320141	Everyone
for
-
partaking [only]
of milk
320147	[is] inexperienced
320149	in [the] word
of righteousness
an infant
for
he is
[for the] mature
however
is
320158	-
320160	solid
food
the [ones]
320164	by
320166	-
constant use
320169	the
senses
training
having
320174	for
320176	distinguishing
good
both
and
evil
Therefore
having left
320184	the
320187	-
320189	beginning
320191	of the
Christ
teaching
320195	to
320197	-
maturity
we should go on
not
again
320203	a foundation
laying
320206	of repentance
320208	from
320210	dead
works
and
320214	faith
320216	in
God
320219	about baptisms
instruction
320222	of laying on
then
of hands
320226	of [the] resurrection
of [the] dead
and
320230	of judgment
eternal
And
this
we will do
if
permits
320238	-
God
[It is] impossible
for
to those
once
having been enlightened
having tasted
then
320248	of the
320250	gift
320252	-
heavenly
and
320256	partakers
having become
320259	of [the] Spirit
Holy
and
320263	[the] goodness
having tasted
320266	of Godâs
word
320269	[the] power
also
320272	[of the] coming
age
and then
having fallen away
again
to restore [them]
320279	to
repentance
crucifying
in themselves
320284	the
320286	Son
320288	-
of God
and
subjecting [Him] to open shame
Land
for
-
having drunk in
320297	the
320300	upon
it
coming
often
rain
and
producing
320308	vegetation
useful
for those
320312	for the sake of
whom
also
it is tilled
partakes
of blessing
320319	from
320321	-
God
[That] bringing forth
however
thorns
and
thistles
[is] worthless
and
320331	a curse
near to
320334	of which
320336	the
end [is]
320339	unto
burning
We are persuaded
however
320344	concerning
you
beloved
320348	of
better [things]
and
[things] accompanying
salvation
if
even
like this
we speak
Not
for
unjust [is]
320361	-
God
to forget
320365	the
320367	work
of you
and
320371	the
love
that
you have shown
320376	toward
320378	the
320380	name
of Him
having ministered
320384	to the
saints
and
[still] ministering
We desire
now
320391	each
of you
320394	the
320396	same
to show
earnestness
320400	toward
320402	the
320404	full assurance
320406	of the
hope
320409	unto
[the] end
so that
not
sluggish
you may be
320416	imitators
however
of those
320420	through
faith
and
patience
inheriting
320426	the
promises
320429	-
For
to Abraham
having made His promise
320434	-
God
since
320438	by
320440	no one
He had
greater
to swear
He swore
320446	by
Himself
saying
If
surely
blessing
I will bless
you
and
multiplying
I will multiply
you
And
thus
having waited patiently
he obtained
320463	the
promise
Men
for
320468	by
320470	[one]
greater
swear
and
320476	of all
their
disputes
an end
320481	for
confirmation
320484	[is] the
oath
320487	in
which

320496	to the
320498	heirs
320500	of the
promise
320503	the
320505	unchangeableness
320507	of the
320509	purpose
of Him
guaranteed [it]
by an oath
so that
320515	by
320517	two
320519	things
unchangeable
320522	in
which
[it is] impossible
to lie
[for] God
320528	strong
encouragement
we may have
-
having fled for refuge
to take hold
320535	of the
320537	being set before [us]
hope
which
320541	as
320544	an anchor
we have
320547	of the
soul
sure
both
and
unshakable
and
entering
320556	into
320558	that
320560	within
320562	the
veil
where
[the] forerunner
320567	for
us
has entered
Jesus
320572	according to
320574	the
320576	order
of Melchizedek
a high priest
having become
320581	to
320583	the
age
320586	This
for
320589	-
Melchizedek
320592	King
of Salem
320595	priest
320597	-
of God
320600	-
Most High
-
having met
Abraham
returning
320607	from
320609	the
320611	slaughter
320613	of the
kings
and
having blessed
him
[is he] to whom
320620	also
a tenth
320623	of
all
apportioned
Abraham
first
indeed
being translated
320631	king
of righteousness
then
and
320636	also
320638	king
of Salem
which
is
320643	king
of peace
320646	Without father
without mother
without genealogy
neither
320651	beginning
of days
nor

having
having been made like
however
320661	the
320663	Son
320665	-
of God
he remains
a priest
320670	unto
320672	-
all time
Consider
now
how great
this one [was]
to whom
a tenth
Abraham
gave
320683	out of
320685	the
best spoils
320688	the
patriarch
And
those
indeed
320694	out from
320696	the
320698	sons
of Levi
320701	the
priestly office
receiving
a commandment
have
to take a tenth
320708	from the
people
320711	according to
320713	the
law
that
is
320718	from the
320720	brothers
of them
though
having come
320725	out of
320727	the
320729	loin
of Abraham
The [one]
however
not
tracing his ancestry
320736	from
them
has collected a tenth
from Abraham
and
the [one]
having
320744	the
promises
has blessed
320748	Apart from
now
320751	all
dispute
320754	the
inferior
320757	by
320759	the
superior
is blessed
And
here
indeed
tithes
320767	dying
men
receive
in that place
however
it is testified
that
he lives on
And
so
a word
to speak
320780	through
Abraham
320783	also
Levi
the [one]
tithes
receiving
paid the tithe
Still
for
320792	in
320794	the
320796	loin
320798	of [his]
father
he was
when
met
him
Melchizedek
If
indeed
then
perfection
320810	by
320812	the
320814	Levitical
priesthood
were
320818	the
people
for
320822	upon
it
had received [the] Law
what
still
need [was there]
320829	according to
320831	the
320833	order
of Melchizedek
320836	[for] another
to arise
priest
and
not
320842	according to
320844	the
320846	order
of Aaron
to be named
Being changed
for
320852	of the
priesthood
320855	from
necessity
320858	also
320860	of law
a change
takes place
320864	[He] concerning
whom
for
are said
these things
320870	a tribe
another
belonged to
320874	from
which
no one
has served
320879	at the
altar
[It is] evident
for
that
320885	out of
Judah
has sprung
320889	the
320891	Lord
of us
320894	as to
320896	which
a tribe
320899	concerning
priests
nothing
Moses
spoke
And
more abundantly
320907	yet
evident
it is
if
320912	according to
320914	the
320916	likeness
of Melchizedek
arises
320920	a priest
another
who
not
320925	according to
320927	a law
320929	of a commandment
fleshly
has been constituted
but
320934	according to
320936	[the] power
320938	of a life
indestructible
It is testified
for
-
You [are]
a priest
320946	to
320948	the
age
320951	according to
320953	the
320955	order
of Melchizedek
320958	A putting away
indeed
for
there is
320963	of the preceding
commandment
320966	because of
320968	-
320970	its
weakness
and
uselessness
nothing
for
perfected
320978	the
law
320981	[the] introduction
then
320984	of a better
hope
320987	by
which
we draw near
320991	-
to God
And
320995	to
as much as
not
320999	apart from
an oath
those ones
truly
for
321005	without
an oath
321008	are
priests
becoming
[He]
however
321014	with
an oath
321017	through
the [One]
saying
321021	to
Him
Has sworn
[the] Lord
and
not
will change His mind
You [are]
a priest
321031	to
321033	the
age
321036	By
so much
321039	also
321042	of a better
covenant
has become
[the] guarantee
Jesus
And
321049	those
indeed
many
321053	are
having become
priests
321057	because of
-
by death
being prevented from
continuing
-
But
321065	because of
the
abiding
of Him
321070	to
321072	the
age
a permanent
He holds
321077	-
priesthood
wherefore
also
to save
321083	to
321085	the
uttermost
He is able
those
drawing near
321091	through
Him
321094	-
to God
always
living
321099	for
-
to intercede
321103	for
them
321106	Such
indeed
for us
also
was fitting
321112	a high priest
holy
innocent
undefiled
having been separated
321118	from
321120	-
sinners
and
higher
321125	than the
heavens
having become
who
not
has
321132	every
day
need
321136	as
321138	the
high priests
first
321142	for
321144	the
321146	own
sins
sacrifices
to offer up
then
321152	for those
321154	of the
people
this
for
He did
once for all
Himself
having offered up
321163	The
law
for
men
appoints
as high priests
having
weakness
321172	the
321174	word
however
321177	of the
oath
321180	which [is]
321182	after
321184	the
law
a Son
321188	to
321190	the
age
having been perfected
321194	[The] sum
now
321197	of
the things
being spoken of [is that]
321201	such
we have
a high priest
who
sat down
321207	at
321209	[the] right hand
321211	of the
321213	throne
321215	of the
Majesty
321218	in
321220	the
heavens
321224	in the
holy places
a minister
and
321229	in the
321231	tabernacle
321233	-
true
which
has pitched
321238	the
Lord
321241	not
man
321244	Every
for
high priest
321248	in order
-
to offer
gifts
both
and
sacrifices
is appointed
wherefore [it was]
necessary
to have
something
321261	also
[for] this One
that
He might offer
If
certainly
then
He were
321270	on
earth
not even
-
would He be
a priest
there being
those
offering
321280	according to
law
321283	the
gifts
who
321287	a copy
and
shadow
serve
321292	of the
heavenly
as
was divinely instructed
Moses
being about
to complete
321300	the
tabernacle
See that
for
He says
you shall make
all things
321308	according to
321310	the
pattern
-
having been shown
you
321316	in
321318	the
mountain
Now
however
321323	more excellent
He has obtained
a ministry
as much as
also
321330	of a better
He is
covenant
[the] mediator
which
321336	upon
321338	better
promises
has been enacted
If
for
321345	the
first
that
had been
faultless
not
-
321353	for a second
would have been sought
a place
Finding fault
for
with them
He says
Behold
[the] days
are coming
says
[the] Lord
and
I will ratify
321368	with
321370	the
321372	house
of Israel
and
321376	with
321378	the
321380	house
of Judah
321383	a covenant
new
not
321387	according to
321389	the
covenant
that
I made
321394	with
321396	fathers
of them
321399	in
[the] day
of having taken hold of
by Me
321404	the
321406	hand
of them
to lead
them
321411	out of
321413	[the] land
of Egypt
because
they
not
did continue
321420	in
321422	the
321424	covenant
of Me
and I
disregarded
them
says
[the] Lord
For
this [is]
321434	the
covenant
that
I will make
321439	with the
321441	house
of Israel
321444	after
321447	the
days
those
says
[the] Lord
putting
321454	Laws
of Me
321457	into
321459	the
321461	mind
of them
and
321465	upon
321467	hearts
of them
I will inscribe
them
and
I will be
to them
321475	for
God
and
they
will be
to Me
321482	for
a people
And
321486	no
not
shall they teach
each
321491	the
321493	neighbor
of him
and
each
321498	the
321500	brother
of him
saying
Know
321505	the
Lord
because
all
will know
Me
321512	from
[the] least
321515	to [the]
321517	greatest
of them
because
merciful
I will be
321523	toward the
321525	iniquities
of them
and
321529	the
321531	sins
of them
321534	no
not
I shall remember
more
321539	In
-
saying
new
He has made obsolete
321545	the
first
321548	that
then
growing old
and
aging
321554	[is] near
vanishing
Had
indeed
therefore
321560	also
321562	the
first
321565	regulations
of worship
321569	-
and
a sanctuary
earthly
321574	A tabernacle
for
was prepared
321578	the

now
321606	the
321608	second

being called
321615	the Holy
of Holies

321624	the
321626	ark

in every part
with gold

not
it is
now [the time]
to speak
321680	in
detail

322306	same
sacrifices
which
they offer
322311	to
322313	the
continuous
never
is able
those
drawing near
to perfect
Otherwise
not
-
would they have ceased
being offered
322326	because of
-
none
having
any longer
322332	conscience
of sins
those
serving
once
having been cleansed
But
322340	in
these
322343	[there is] a reminder
of sins
322346	every
year
Impossible [it is]
indeed
322351	[for the] blood
of bulls
and
of goats
to take away
sins
Therefore
coming
322360	into
322362	the
world
He says
Sacrifice
and
offering
not
You have desired
a body
however
You have prepared
me
Burnt offerings
and
322377	[offerings] for
sin
not
You have delighted in
Then
I said
Behold
I have come
322386	in
322388	[the] scroll
of [the] book
it is written
322392	of
Me
-
to do
322397	-
O God
322400	the
322402	will
of You
Above
saying
-
Sacrifice
and
offering
and
burnt offerings
and
322414	[offerings] for
sin
not
You have desired
nor
have You delighted in
which
322422	according to
[the] Law
are offered
then
He said
Behold
I have come
-
to do
322432	the
322434	will
of You
He takes away
322438	the
first
that
322442	the
second
He might establish
322446	By
322448	that
will
322451	having been sanctified
we are
322454	through
322456	the
322458	offering
322460	of the
322462	body
of Jesus
Christ
once for all
And
322468	every
indeed
priest
stands
322473	every
day
ministering
and
322478	the
322480	same
repeatedly
offering
sacrifices
which
never
are able
to take away
sins
This [One]
however
322492	one
322494	for
sins
having offered
sacrifice
322499	in
322501	-
perpetuity
sat down
322505	at
322507	[the] right hand
322509	-
of God
322512	the
henceforth
awaiting
until
should be placed
322518	the
322520	enemies
of Him
322523	[as] a footstool
322525	for the
322527	feet
of Him
322530	By one
for
offering
He has perfected
322535	for
322537	-
all time
those
being sanctified
Bears witness
now
to us
322545	also
322547	the
322549	Spirit
322551	-
Holy
322554	after
for
-
having said
This [is]
322560	the
covenant
that
I will make
322565	with
them
322568	after
322571	the
days
those
says
[the] Lord
putting
322578	[the] laws
of Me
322581	into
322583	[the] hearts
of them
322586	and
322588	into
322590	the
322592	mind
of them
I will inscribe
them
and
322598	The
322600	sins
of them
and
322604	the
322606	lawless acts
of them
322609	no
not
will I remember
any more
Where
now
322616	forgiveness
of these [is]
no longer [is there]
322620	an offering
322622	for
sin
Having
therefore
brothers
322628	confidence
322630	for
322632	the
322634	entering
322636	the
holy places
322639	by
322641	the
322643	blood
of Jesus
which
He dedicated
for us
322649	a way
new
and
living
322654	through
322656	the
veil
that
is
322661	the
322663	flesh
of Him
and [having]
322667	a priest
great
322670	over
322672	the
322674	house
322676	-
of God
we should draw near
322680	with
322682	a sincere
heart
322685	in
322687	full assurance
of faith
having been sprinkled clean
322691	[our]
hearts
322694	from
322696	a conscience
evil
and
having been washed
322701	[our]
body
322704	with water
pure
We should hold fast
322708	to the
322710	confession
322712	of [our]
hope
firmly
faithful
for [is]
the [One]
having promised
And
we should think
one another
322723	toward
322725	stirring up
to love
and
322729	to good
works
not
forsaking
322734	the
322736	assembling together
of ourselves
as
[is the] custom
with some
but
encouraging [one another]
322744	and
so much
more
as
you see
drawing near
322751	the
Day
[If] willingly
for
sin
we
322758	after [we are]
-
to receive
322762	the
322764	knowledge
322766	of the
truth
no longer
322770	for
sins
remains
a sacrifice
322775	terrifying
however
322778	a certain
322780	expectation
of judgment
and
322785	of fire
fury
to devour
being about
322790	the
adversaries
Having set aside
anyone
322795	[the] law
of Moses
322798	without
mercies
322801	on the basis of
322803	two
or
three
witnesses
he dies
How much
think you
322811	worse
will he deserve
punishment
the [one]
322816	the
322818	Son
322820	-
of God
having trampled upon
and
322825	the
322827	blood
322829	of the
covenant
ordinary
having esteemed
322834	by
which
he was sanctified
and
322839	the
322841	Spirit
322843	-
of grace
having insulted
We know
for
the [One]
having said
Mine
[is] vengeance
I
will repay
and
again
Will judge
[the] Lord
322859	the
322861	people
of Him
[It is] a fearful thing
-
to fall
322867	into
322869	[the] hands
322871	of God
[the] living
Remember
however
322876	the
322878	former
days
322881	in
which
having been enlightened
322885	a great
322887	conflict
you endured
of sufferings
this
indeed
by revilings
both
and
tribulations
being made a spectacle
this
now
322900	partners
of those
thus
passing through [them]
having become
322906	Both
for
322909	with the
prisoners
you sympathized
and
322914	the
322916	plundering
322918	of the
322920	possessions
of you
322923	with
joy
you accepted
knowing
to have
yourselves
322930	a better
possession
and
abiding
Not
throw away
therefore
322938	the
322940	boldness
of you
which
has
322945	a great
reward
322948	Of endurance
for
You have
need
so that
322954	the
322956	will
322958	-
of God
having done
you may receive
322963	the
promise
Yet
for
322968	A little
very
while
the [One]
coming
will come
and
not
will delay
322978	The one
however
322981	righteous
of Mine
322984	by
faith
will live
and
if
he might shrink back
not
takes pleasure
322993	the
322995	soul
of Me
322998	in
him
We
however
not
are
323005	of [those] drawing back
323007	to
destruction
but
323011	of faith
323013	to

this
for
were commended
323035	the
ancients
By faith
we understand
to have been formed
323041	the
universe
323044	by [the] word
of God
323047	so that
which
not
323051	from [things]
being visible
the things
being seen
have been made
By faith
323059	a more excellent
sacrifice
Abel
323063	than
Cain
offered
323067	-
to God
323070	through
which
he was testified
to be

of him
323084	-
God
and
323088	through
it
having died
still

By faith
Enoch
was translated
-
not
to see
death
and
not
was he found
because
had taken up
him
323107	-
God
323110	Before
for
323113	the
translation
he was commended
to have pleased
323118	-
God
323121	Without
now
faith
[it is] impossible
to please [Him]
To believe
for
it behooves
the one
drawing near
323132	-
to God
that
He exists
and [that]
to those
earnestly seeking out
Him
a rewarder
He becomes

an ark
323154	for
323156	[the] salvation
323158	of the
323160	household
of him
323163	by
which
he condemned
323167	the

323192	for
an inheritance
and
went out
not
knowing
where
he is going
By faith
he sojourned
323203	in

He was awaiting
for
323235	the

having confessed
that
strangers
and
sojourners
they are

Those
for
such things

make manifest
that [their]

they are seeking
And
if
indeed
that
they had been remembering
323360	from
where
they came out
they would have had

opportunity
to return
Now
however
a better [one]

Therefore

323942	unto

have you resisted

struggling
and
you have forgotten
323954	the
exhortation
that

of Me
not
regard lightly
323967	[the] discipline

faint
323972	by

disciplines
He scourges

If
however
324008	without

of discipline
324012	of which
partakers
they have become
all
then
illegitimate children

324020	not

Furthermore
324025	-
indeed
324029	of the
324031	flesh
of us
fathers
we have had
correctors
and
we respected [them]
not
324040	much

shall we be in subjection
324044	to the
324046	Father

Truly
indeed
324056	for
324058	a few
days
324061	according to
that
seeming good
to them
they were disciplining [us]

324082	All

of God
lest
324173	any

of bitterness
up
springing
should trouble [you]
and
324182	by
this
might be defiled
324186	the
many
lest [there be]
any
fornicator
or
324193	profane person
324195	as
Esau

You know
for
that
even
afterward
wishing
to inherit
324217	the

324221	of repentance
for

for
that
being commanded
If even
a beast
should touch
324271	the
mountain
it shall be stoned
And
so
fearful
was
the thing
appearing [that]

said
Greatly afraid

Take heed

it will be given

Let him ask
however

The [one]

325493	Brothers

then
325535	also
325537	a poor [man]

you should look

the [one]

325554	-

should say
You
sit you

have you made a distinction

have become

Listen
325594	brothers
my
beloved
Not
325599	-
God
has chosen
325603	the
325605	poor

in this world
325610	[to be] rich
325612	in

He promised

Him
You

have dishonored
325629	the

Not
325633	the

are oppressing
you
and
they
dragging
you
325642	into
court
Not
they
are blaspheming
325648	the
325650	good
Name
-
having been called
325655	upon
you
If
indeed
325660	[the] law
you keep
royal
325664	according to
325666	the
Scripture
You shall love
325670	the

as
yourself
well
you are doing
If
however
you show partiality

you are committing
being convicted

as
transgressors
Whoever
for
325694	all
325696	the

shall keep
shall stumble
but
325702	in
one [point]
he has become
325706	of all
guilty
The [One]
for
having said
Not
you shall commit adultery
said
also
Not
you shall murder
If
however
not
you do commit adultery
do commit murder
however
you have become
325725	a transgressor
of [the] law
So
speak
and
so
act
as
325734	by
325736	[the] law
of freedom
being about
to be judged
325741	-
For
judgment
without mercy [will be]

having shown
mercy
Triumphs over
mercy
judgment
What [is]
325754	the
profit
325757	brothers
of me
if
faith
says
anyone
to have
works
however
not
he has
Not
is able
325771	the
faith
to save
him
Now if
a brother
or
a sister
without clothes
is
and
lacking
325784	-
325786	of daily
food
says
then
325791	anyone
to them
325794	out from
you
Go
325798	in
peace
be warmed
and
be filled
not
gives
however
to them
325808	the
325810	needful things
325812	for the
body
what [is]
325816	the
profit
So
325820	also
325822	-
faith
if
not
it has
works
dead
is
325831	by
itself
But
will say
someone
You
faith
have
and I
works
have
Show
me
325845	the
325847	faith
of you
325850	without
325852	-
works
and I
you
will show
325858	by
325860	the
325862	works
of me
325865	-

You
believe
that

is
325873	-
God
Well
you are doing
325878	Even
325880	the
demons
believe [that]
and
shudder
Do you want
however
to come to know
325889	O
325891	man
foolish
that
325895	-

325898	apart from
325900	-

Abraham
325906	the
325908	father
of us
not
325912	by
works
was justified
having offered
Isaac
325918	the
325920	son
of him
325923	upon
325925	the
altar
You see
that
325930	[his]
faith
was working with
325934	the
325936	works
of him
and
325940	by
325942	[his]
works
325945	[his]
faith
was perfected
And
was fulfilled
325951	the
Scripture
-
saying
Believed
then
Abraham
325959	-
God
and
it was counted
to him
325965	for
righteousness
and
325969	a friend
of God
he was called
You see
that
325975	by
works
is justified
a man
and
not
325982	by
faith
alone
Likewise
then
325988	also
Rahab
325991	the
prostitute
325994	not
325996	by
works
was justified
having received
326001	the
messengers
and
326005	by another
way
having sent [them] forth
Just as
for
326011	the
body
326014	apart from

dead

so
also

of mine
knowing
that
326038	greater
judgment
we will receive
In many ways
for
we stumble
all
If
anyone
326048	in
what he says
not
does stumble
this one [is]
326055	a perfect
man
able
to bridle
326060	indeed
326062	all
326064	the
body
If
now
326070	of the
horses

326076	into
326078	the
mouths
we put
326082	for

to obey
them
us
326088	even
326090	all
326092	the
326094	body

Behold
326099	also
326101	the
ships
so great
being
and
326107	by
326109	winds
strong
being driven
are turned about
326114	by
326116	a very small
rudder
wherever
326120	the
326122	impulse
of the [one]

resolves
Thus
326128	also
326130	the

and
exceeding things
it boasts
Behold
326141	a small
fire
326144	how great
a forest
it kindles
Also
326149	the
tongue [is]
a fire
326153	the
326155	world
326157	-
of iniquity
326160	The
tongue
is set
326164	among
326166	the
326168	members
of us

defiling
326173	all
326175	the

and
has been subdued
326210	by the
326212	race
326214	of the
human
326217	-
but
the tongue
326221	no one

of men
[it is] an unruly
evil
326228	full
326230	of poison

326233	With
it
we bless
326237	our
Lord
and
Father
and
326243	with
it
we curse

326257	Out of

olives
to produce
Or
a vine
figs
Nor
a salt [spring]
326308	fresh

Who
[is] wise
and
understanding
326316	among
you
let him show
326320	out of
326322	the

326327	the

is
326363	this
326365	the

[is] earthly
unspiritual
demonic

326410	[The] fruit

From where
[come] disputes

[Is it] not

of you
326810	like

326911	for
it
until

Be patient
326920	also
you

326924	the
326926	hearts
of you
because
326930	the
326932	coming
326934	of the

has drawn near
Not

326941	against
one another
so that
not
you may be condemned
Behold
326948	the
Judge
326951	before
326953	the

of suffering evils
and

who
spoke
326973	in
326975	the
326977	name
of [the] Lord
Behold
we count blessed
those
having persevered
326984	The
326986	perseverance
of Job
you have heard of
and
326991	the
326993	outcome
from [the] Lord
you have seen
that
full of compassion
is
327000	the
Lord
and
[is] merciful
327005	Before
all things
however
327009	brothers

neither [by]

nor

not
327042	under

you might fall
Is suffering hardships
327047	anyone
327049	among
you
Let him pray
Is cheerful
anyone
Let him sing praises
Is sick
327057	anyone
327059	among
you
Let him call near
327063	the
327065	elders
327067	of the
church
and
let them pray
327072	over
him
having anointed
with oil
327077	in
327079	the
327081	name
327083	of the
Lord
And
327087	the
327089	prayer
327091	-
of faith
will save
the one
ailing
and
will raise up
him

Lord
and if
sins
327105	he might be [one]
having committed
it will be forgiven
him
Confess
therefore
to one another
327113	the
sins
and
pray
327118	for
one another
so that
you may be healed
Much
prevails
327125	[the] prayer
of a righteous [man]
being made effective
Elijah
327130	a man
was
327133	of like nature
to us
and
with fervent prayer
he prayed [for it]
-
not

not
it did rain
327145	upon
327147	the
earth
327150	years
three
and
327154	months

And
again
he prayed
and
327161	the
heaven
rain
gave
and
327167	the
earth
produced
327171	the
327173	fruit
of it

the [one]

a sinner
327200	from
327202	[the] error

as
327633	of a lamb
without blemish
and
without spot
327638	of Christ

Having been born again
not
327720	of

perishable
but
of imperishable
327727	by
327730	[the] word
living
of God
and
abiding
because
327737	All
flesh [is]
327740	like
grass
and
327744	all
327746	[the] glory
of it
327749	like
327751	[the] flower
of grass
Withers
327755	the

and
327759	the
flower
falls away
327763	-
but
327766	the word
of [the] Lord
abides
327770	to
327772	the
age
This
now
is
327778	the
word
-
having been proclaimed
327783	to
you
Having put aside
therefore
327788	all
malice
and
327792	all
deceit
and
hypocrisy
and
envies
and
327800	all

327803	like

327808	-
327810	reasonable
327812	pure
milk
crave
so that
327817	by
it
you may grow up
327821	in respect to
salvation
if indeed
you have tasted
that
[is] good
327828	the
Lord
327831	To
whom
coming
327836	a stone
living
327839	by
men
indeed
rejected
327844	in the sight of
however
God
327848	chosen
[and] precious
327851	also
you yourselves
327854	as
327856	stones
living
are being built up
327860	as a house
spiritual
327863	into
327865	a priesthood
holy
to offer
327870	spiritual
sacrifices
acceptable
to God
327875	through
Jesus
Christ
Therefore
it is contained
327881	in
Scripture
Behold
I lay
327886	in
Zion
327891	a stone
a chosen
cornerstone
precious
and
the [one]
believing
327899	on
Him
327902	no
not
shall be put to shame
To you
therefore [is]
327908	the
preciousness
-
believing
[to those] disobeying
however
[The] stone
which
have rejected
those
building
this
has become
327922	into
327924	[the] head
of [the] corner
and
327928	A stone
of stumbling
and
327932	a rock
of offense
[They]
stumble at
327937	to the
word
being disobedient
327941	to
which
also
they were appointed
You
however
327948	[are] a race
chosen
327951	a royal
priesthood
327954	a nation
holy
327957	a people
327959	for [His]
possession
so that
327963	the
327965	excellencies
you may proclaim

327969	out of
darkness

having called
327974	to
327976	the
327978	marvelous
327980	of Him

who
once [were]
not

now
however
327989	[the] people
of God

not
having received mercy
now
however
having received mercy
Beloved
I exhort [you]
328000	as
aliens
and
sojourners
to abstain
328006	from
328008	fleshly
desires

Gentiles
keeping
honorable
so that
328031	wherein
which
they speak against
you
as
evildoers
328038	through
328040	the
328042	good
deeds
having witnessed
they may glorify
328047	-
God
328050	in
328052	[the] day
of visitation
Be in subjection
328056	to every
328058	human
institution
328061	for the sake of
328063	the
Lord
whether
328067	to [the] king
328069	as
being supreme
or
to governors
as
328075	by
him
being sent
328079	for
328081	vengeance
to evildoers
328084	praise
then
to well doers
because
this
is
328091	the
328093	will
328095	-
of God
doing good
to put to silence
328100	the
328103	-
328105	of foolish
men
ignorance
as
free
and
not
as
328114	a cover-up
having
328117	for
evil
328120	the
freedom
but
as
328125	of God
servants
Everyone
honor
328130	The
brotherhood

328157	to the
good
and
gentle
but
328163	also
328165	to the
unreasonable
This
for
[is] acceptable
if
328172	for sake of
328174	conscience
toward God
endures
anyone
griefs
suffering
unjustly
What kind of
for
credit [is it]
if
sinning
and
being struck
you shall endure
But
if
doing good
and
suffering
you shall endure
this [is]
commendable
328198	before
God
328201	To this
hereunto
for
you have been called
because
328207	also
Christ
suffered
328211	for
you

leaving
an example
that
you should follow after
328219	the
328221	steps
of Him
Who
sin
not
committed
neither
was found
trickery
328231	in
328233	the
328235	mouth
of Him
Who
being reviled
not
reviled in return
suffering
not
threatened
He gave [Himself] over
however
to Him
judging
justly
328250	Who
328252	the
328254	sins
of us
Himself
bore
328259	in
328261	the
328263	body
of Him
328266	on
328268	the
tree
so that
328272	-
to sins
having been dead
328276	-
to righteousness
we might live
328280	By whose
328282	-
wounds
you have been healed
You were
for
328288	like
328290	sheep
going astray
but
you have returned
now
328296	to
328298	the

and
Overseer
328304	of the

328318	even
if
any

328326	by
328328	the
328331	of the
wives
conduct
328335	without
word
they will be won over
having witnessed
328340	the
328344	in
respect
328347	pure
conduct
of you
whose
let it be
not
328354	the
328356	external
328359	of braiding
of hair
and
328363	putting around
of gold
or
328367	putting on
of garments
adorning

328372	the
328375	hidden
328378	of the
heart

328382	in
328384	the
328386	imperishable
328388	of the
328390	gentle

of great worth
In this way

because
328506	to
this
you were called
so that
blessing
you should inherit
The [one]
for
desiring
life
to love
and
to see
328520	days
good
let him keep
328524	the
tongue
328527	from
evil
and
lips
-
not
to speak

Let him turn away
also
328538	from
evil
and
let him do
good
Let him seek
peace
and
let him pursue
it
Because
328550	[the] eyes
of [the] Lord
328553	[are] on
[the] righteous
and
328557	[the] ears
of Him
328560	toward
328562	prayer
of them
328565	[The] face
however
of [the] Lord
328569	[is] against
those doing
evil
And
who [is]
he who
will harm
you
if
328580	for that which [is]
good
zealous
you should be
But
if
even
you should suffer
328589	because of
righteousness
[you are] blessed
328593	-
And
328596	the threats
of them
not
you should be afraid of
neither
should you be troubled
[As] Lord
however
328605	-
Christ
sanctify
328609	in
328611	the
328613	hearts
of you
ready
always
328618	for
a defense
328621	to everyone
-
asking
you
328626	an account
328628	concerning
328630	the
328633	in
you
hope
yet
328638	with
gentleness
and
fear
328643	a conscience
having
good
so that
328648	in
this
they might speak against you
they shall be ashamed
those
reviling
328655	your
328657	-
328659	good
328662	in
Christ
manner of life
[It is] better
for
doing good
if
wills [it]
328671	the
328673	will
328675	-
of God
to suffer
than
doing evil
because
328682	also
Christ
once
328686	for
sins
suffered
[the] righteous
328691	for
[the] unrighteous
so that
you
He might bring
328697	-
to God
having been put to death
indeed
in [the] flesh
having been made alive
however
in [the] spirit
328706	in
which
328709	also
328711	to the
328714	in
prison
spirits
having gone
He preached
having disobeyed
at one time
when
was waiting
328724	the
328727	-
of God
longsuffering
328731	in
328733	[the] days
of Noah
being prepared
of [the] ark
328738	in
which
a few
that
is
328744	eight
souls
were saved
328748	through
water
which
328752	also
you
prefigures
now
saving
baptism
not
328760	of flesh
328762	a putting away
of [the] filth
but
328768	of a conscience
good
[the] demand
328772	toward
God
328775	through
328777	[the] resurrection
of Jesus
Christ
who
is
328783	at
328785	[the] right hand
of God
having gone
328789	into
heaven
having been subjected
to Him
angels
and
authorities
and
powers
Christ
therefore
having suffered
in [the] flesh
328803	also
you
328806	the
328808	same
mind
arm yourselves with
because
the [one]
having suffered
[in the] flesh
is done with
sin
328818	so as
-
no longer
328822	to menâs
desires
but
328826	to [the] will
of God
328829	the
328831	remaining
328834	in
[the] flesh
to live
time
[Is] sufficient
for
328841	the
328843	past
time
328846	the
328848	desire
328850	of the
Gentiles
to have carried out
having walked
328855	in
sensuality
lusts
drunkenness
orgies
carousing
and
328863	abominable
idolatries
328866	With respect to
this
they think it strange
not
running with [them]
of you
328873	into
328875	the
328877	same
328880	-
of debauchery
overflow
speaking evil [of you]
who
will give
account
to Him who
ready
is
to judge
[the] living
and
[the] dead
328895	To
this [end]
indeed
328899	even
to [the] dead
the gospel was proclaimed
so that
they might be judged
indeed
328906	according to
men
in [the] flesh
they might live
however
328912	according to
God
in [the] spirit
328916	Of all
now
328919	the
end
has drawn near
Be clear minded
therefore
and
sober
328927	for the purpose of
prayers
328930	above
all things
328933	-
328936	among
yourselves

fervent

because
love
covers over
328946	a multitude
of sins
hospitable
328950	to
one another
328953	without
complaint
each
as
has received
a gift
328960	to
each other
them
serving
as
328966	good
328968	stewards
328970	of [the] manifold
328972	grace
of God
if
anyone
speaks
as
328979	oracles
of God
if
anyone
serves
as
328986	of
strength
which
supplies
328991	-
God
so that
328995	in
all things
may be glorified
328999	-
God
329002	through
Jesus
Christ
to whom

Amen

fire
329035	for
a trial
to you
taking place
as if
a strange thing
to you
were happening
But
as
you have shared
329047	in the
329050	-

329060	the
329062	revelation
329064	of the
329066	glory
of Him
you may rejoice
exulting
If
you are insulted
329073	in
329075	[the] name
of Christ
[you are] blessed
because
329080	the
329082	-
of glory
and
329086	-
329089	-
of God
Spirit
329093	upon

rests
Not
for
329099	any
of you
let suffer
329103	as
a murderer
or
a thief
or
an evildoer
or
329111	as
a troublesome meddler
if

For [it is]
329134	the

329952	the

mountain
And
we have
more certain
329960	the

word
to which
well
you do
taking heed
as

shining
329973	in
329975	[a] dark
place
329978	until
this
day
shall have dawned
and
[the] morning star
shall have arisen
329986	in
329988	the
329990	hearts
of you
this
first
knowing
that
329997	any
329999	prophecy
of Scripture
330002	of its own
interpretation
not

Not

There were
however
330029	also
false prophets
330032	among
330034	the
people
as
330038	also
330040	among

there will be
false teachers

And
many
will follow after
330067	their

sensuality
330072	through
whom
330075	the
330077	way
330079	of the
truth
will be maligned
And
330084	through
covetousness
330087	with fabricated
words
you
they will exploit
for whom
330093	the
judgment
of long ago
not
is idle
and
330100	the

330112	[the] angels
having sinned
not
spared
but
330118	in chains
of gloomy darkness
having cast [them] down to Tartarus
delivered [them]
330123	for
judgment
being kept
and
330128	[the] ancient

He spared
but

[the] flood upon
330141	[the] world
of [the] ungodly

them
330251	before
[the] Lord
330254	a reviling
judgment
These
however
330259	like

330523	This

through your

this

that
will come
330580	in
330582	[the] last

330587	with

and

Where
is
330605	the
330607	promise
330609	of the
330611	coming
of Him
330614	From
[the time] that
for
330618	the
fathers
fell asleep
all things
as they were

330625	from
330627	[the] beginning
of creation
It is concealed from
indeed
them
this
willingly
that
heavens
existed
long ago
and
[the] earth
330641	out of
water
and
330645	through
water
having been composed
330649	by the

330656	through
which
330659	the
330661	at that time

with water
having been deluged
perished

But
330670	now
the heavens
and

however
thing
not
let be hidden from
you

that
330709	one
day
330712	with [the]
Lord [is]
330715	like
330717	a thousand

the Lord
330732	the
promise
as
some
slowness

is patient
330741	toward
you
not
willing
[for] any
to perish

all
330750	to
repentance
to come
Will come
however
330756	[the] day
of [the] Lord
330759	like
a thief
330762	in
which
330765	the
heavens
with a roar
will pass away
elements
then
burning with heat
will be dissolved
and
[the] earth
and

330780	in

in this way
all

330796	holy
conduct

godliness

and
hastening
330804	the
330806	coming
330808	of the
330811	-
of God
day
330815	by reason of
which
[the] heavens
being set on fire
will be dissolved

[the] elements
burning with heat
are melting

dwells
Therefore
beloved
these things

be diligent
without spot
and
without blemish
by Him
to be found
330856	in
peace
And
330860	the

330923	the

You
therefore
beloved
knowing [this] beforehand
beware
that
not
330944	by the
330947	of the
lawless
error
having been led away
you should fall from
330953	the
330955	own
steadfastness
Grow
however
330960	in
330962	grace
and
in knowledge

330976	the

both
now
and
330982	to
330984	[the] day
of eternity
That which
was
330989	from
[the] beginning
that which
we have heard
that which
we have seen
330996	with the
330998	eyes
of us
that which
we have gazed upon
and
331004	the
331006	hands
of us
have handled
331010	concerning
331012	the
331014	Word
331016	-
of life
and
331020	the
life
was made manifest
and
we have seen
and
bear witness
and
we proclaim
to you
331031	the
331033	life
331035	-
eternal
which
was
331040	with
331042	the
Father
and
was revealed
to us
that which
we have seen
and
have heard
we proclaim
331053	also
to you
so that
331057	also
you
fellowship
may have
331062	with
us
331065	Indeed
331067	the
331069	fellowship
now
331072	-
of us
331075	[is] with
331077	the
Father
and
331081	with
331083	the
331085	Son
of Him
Jesus
Christ
And
these things
write
we
so that
331095	the
331097	joy
of us
331100	might be
complete
And
is
this
331106	the
message
that
we have heard
331111	from
Him
and
we preach
to you
that
331118	-
God
light
is
and
331124	darkness
331126	in
Him
not
is
none
If
we should say
that
fellowship
we have
331137	with
Him
and yet
331141	in
331143	the
darkness
should walk
we lie
and
not
do practice
331151	the
truth
If
however
331156	in
331158	the
light
we should walk
as
He
is
331165	in
331167	the
light
fellowship
we have
331172	with
one another
and
331176	the
331178	blood
of Jesus
331181	the
331183	Son
of Him
cleanses
us
331188	from
331190	all
sin
If
we should say
that
sin
not
we have
ourselves
we deceive
and
331202	the
truth
not
is
331207	in
us
If
we should confess
331212	the
331214	sins
of us
faithful
He is
and
just
that
He may forgive
us
331224	[our]
sins
and
might cleanse
us
331230	from
331232	all
unrighteousness
If
we should say
that
not
we have sinned
a liar
we make
Him
and
331244	the
331246	word
of Him
not
is
331251	in
us
331254	Little children
of me
these things
I am writing
to you
so that
not
you might sin
And
if
anyone
should sin
an advocate
we have
331269	with
331271	the
Father
Jesus
Christ
[the] Righteous [One]
And
He
[the] propitiation
is
331281	for
331283	the
331285	sins
of us
not
331290	for
331292	the
of ours
and
only
but
331298	also
331300	for
331302	all
331304	the
world
And
331308	by
this
we know
that
we have come to know
Him
if
331316	the
331318	commandments
of Him
we should keep
The [one]
saying
-
I have known
Him
and
331328	the
331330	commandments
of Him
not
keeping
a liar
he is
and
331338	in
him
331341	the
truth
not
is
Whoever
however
-
may keep
331350	His
331352	-
word
truly
331356	in
him
331359	the
331361	love
331363	-
of God
has been perfected
331367	By
this
we know
that
331372	in
Him
we are
The [one]
claiming
331378	in
Him
to abide
ought
just as
that
walk
331386	also
He
in the same way
walked
Beloved
not
331393	a commandment
new
I am writing
to you
but
331399	a commandment
old
which
you have had
331404	from
[the] beginning
331407	The
331409	commandment
331411	-
old
is
331415	the
word
that
you have heard
Again
331421	a commandment
new
I am writing
to you
which
is
true
331429	in
Him
and
331433	in
you
because
331437	the
darkness
is passing away
and
331442	the
331444	light
331446	-
true
already
shines

it is
and
as
you have heard
that
antichrist
is coming
331722	even
now
331725	antichrists
many
have arisen
whereby
we know
that
331732	[the] last
hour
it is
331736	From among
us
they went out
but
not
they were
331743	of
us
if
for
331748	of

they had been
they would have remained

But
[it is] so that

And
you

and
know you
all
Not

331806	the
liar
if
not
the [one]
denying
that
Jesus
not

This
is

331834	Everyone

You
what

And
this
is

These things
I have written

Him
abides
331928	in

you
331948	concerning
all things

a lie
and
just as

you
you shall abide
331963	in
Him
And
now
little children
abide
331970	in

so that
when
He appears
we might have
boldness
and
not
be ashamed
331981	before
Him
331984	at
331986	the

to us
332017	the
Father
that
332021	children
of God
we should be called
and
we are
332027	Because of
this
332030	the

not

us
because
not
it knew
Him
Beloved
now
332042	children
of God
are we
and
not yet
has been revealed
what
we will be
We know
that
when
He appears
like
Him
we will be
for
we will see
Him
as

And
332064	everyone

And
you know

He
appeared
so that

He might take away
and

The [one]

332159	of

because
332166	from
[the] beginning
332169	the
devil
has been sinning
332173	For
this [reason]
was revealed
332177	the
332179	Son
332181	-
of God
so that
He might destroy
332186	the

332193	Anyone

of Him
332209	in

and
not

to continue sinning
because
332218	of

332224	Through
this

are
332229	the

For
this
is
332269	the
message
that
you have heard
332274	from
[the] beginning
that
we should love
one another
not
as
Cain
332283	[who] of
332285	the
evil [one]
was
and
slew
332291	the
332293	brother
of him
And
332297	because of
what
he slayed
him
Because
332303	the
332305	works
of him
evil
were
332310	those
however
332313	of the

not
be surprised
brothers
if
hates
you
332325	the
world
We
know
that
we have passed
332332	from
332334	-
death
332337	to
332339	-
life
because
we love
332344	[our]

The [one]
not

abides
332351	in
332353	-
death
332356	Everyone
-
hating
332360	the
332362	brother
of him
a murderer
is
and
you know
that
332370	any
murderer
not
has
332376	life
eternal
332379	in
him
abiding
332383	By
this
we have known
332387	-
love
because
He
332392	for
us
332395	the
332397	life
of Him
laid down
and
we
ought
332404	for
332406	[our]
brothers
332409	[our]
lives
to lay down
Whoever
now

might have
332417	the
332419	goods
332421	of the
world
and
might see
332426	the
332428	brother
of him
need
having
and
might close up
332435	the
332437	heart
of him
332440	from
him
how
332444	the
332446	love
332448	-
of God
abides
332452	in
him
Little children
not
we should love
in word
nor
332460	in
tongue
but
332464	in
action
and
in truth
332469	by
this
we will know
that
332474	of
332476	the
truth
we are
and
332481	before
Him
we will assure
332485	the
332487	heart
of us
that
if

332493	our
332495	-
heart
that
greater than

332501	-
God
332504	the
332506	heart
of us
and
He knows
all things
Beloved
if
332514	the
heart
not
should condemn [us]
confidence
we have
332521	toward
332523	-
God
and
whatever
if
we might ask
we receive
332531	from
Him
because
332535	the
332537	commandments
of Him
we keep
and
332542	the things
pleasing
332545	before
Him
we do
And
this
is
332552	the
332554	commandment
of Him
that
we should believe
332559	in the
332561	name
332563	the
332565	Son
of Him
Jesus
Christ
and
we should love
one another
just as
He gave
[the] commandment
to us
And

332580	the
332582	commandments
of Him
332585	in
Him
abides
and
He
332591	in
him
And
332595	by
this
we know
that
He abides
332601	in

but
test
332620	the
spirits
whether
332624	of
332626	-
God
they are
because
332631	many
false prophets
have gone out
332635	into
332637	the
world
332640	By
this
you know
332644	the

332648	-
of God
332651	Every

You

of truth
and
332792	the

not
that

Beloved
if
so

If

-
I love
333151	-
God
and
333155	the
333157	brother

And
333184	this
333186	the

we have
333190	from
Him
that
the [one]

333200	also

This

having overcome

Who
is
the [one]
overcoming

that
Jesus
is
333331	the

of God
This
is
the [One]

but
333357	by
333359	-

and
333363	by

And
333369	the
Spirit
is
the [One]

because
333376	the

For

there are

bearing testimony

are
If
333410	the
333412	testimony

of men
we receive

of God

is
For
this
is
333430	the
333432	testimony
333434	-
of God
that
He has testified
333439	concerning
333441	the
333443	Son
of Him
The [one]
believing
333448	in
333450	the
333452	Son
333454	-
of God
has
333458	the
testimony
333461	in
himself
The [one]
not
believing
333467	-
God
a liar
has made
Him
because
not
he has believed
333476	in
333478	the
testimony
that
has testified
333483	-
God
333486	concerning
333488	the

And
this
is
333496	the
testimony
that
333500	life
eternal
has given
333504	-
God
to us
and
333509	this
333511	the

333536	Son
333538	-
of God
333541	-

These things
have I written
to you
so that
you may know
that
333552	life
you have
eternal
to those
believing
333558	in
333560	the
333562	name
333564	of the
333566	Son
333568	-
of God
And
this
is
333574	the
confidence
that
we have
333579	toward
Him
that
if
anything
we might ask
333586	according to
333588	the
333590	will
of Him
He hears
us
And
if
we know
that
He hears
us
whatever
if
we might ask
we know
that
we have
333607	the
requests
that
we have asked
333612	from
Him
If
anyone
should see
333618	the
333620	brother
of him
sinning
333624	a sin
333626	not
333628	unto
death
he shall ask
and
He will give
him
life
to those
sinning
333638	not
333640	unto
death
There is
333644	a sin
333646	unto
death
not
333650	concerning
that
do I say
that
he should implore
333656	All
unrighteousness
sin
is
and
there is
333663	sin
333665	not
333667	unto
death
We know
that
333672	everyone
-
having been born
333676	of
333678	-
God
not
continues to sin
but
the [One]
having been begotten
333686	of
333688	-
God
protects
him
and
333694	the
evil [one]
not
does touch
him
We know
that
333702	of
333704	-
God
we are
and
333710	the
world
whole
333714	in
333716	the

We know
now
that
333723	the
333725	Son
333727	-
of God
is come
and
has given

so that
we may know

I rejoiced
exceedingly
that
I have found
333861	[some] of
333863	the
333865	children
of you
walking
333869	in

just as
commandment
we received
333875	from
333877	the
Father
And
now
I implore
you
lady
not
as
333887	a commandment
I am writing
to you
new
but
that which
we have had
333895	from
[the] beginning
that
we should love
one another
And
this
is
333904	-
love
that
we should walk
333909	according to
333911	the
333913	commandments
of Him
This
333917	the
commandment
is
just as
you have heard
333923	from
[the] beginning
so that
333927	in
it
you should walk
For
333932	many
deceivers
have entered
333936	into
333938	the
world
those
not
confessing
Jesus
Christ
coming
333947	in

This
is
333952	the
deceiver
and
333956	the
antichrist
Watch
yourselves
so that
not
you should lose
what things
we have worked for
but
333967	a reward

you may receive

Beloved
faithfully
you are doing
whatever
if
you might have done
334168	toward
334170	the
brothers
and
they are
strangers
who
testified
334178	of your

334183	before
[the] church

well
you will do
having set forward
worthily

334194	On behalf
for
334197	of the

they went forth
nothing
accepting
334203	from
334205	the

We
therefore
ought
to receive
334212	-
such [men]
so that
fellow workers
we may be
334218	in the
truth
I have written
something
334223	to the
church
but
the [one]
loving to be first
among them
Diotrephes
not
welcomes
us
334234	Because of
this
if
I might come
I will bring to remembrance
334240	of him
334242	the
works
which
he is doing
334247	with words
evil
prating against
us
and
not
being satisfied
334255	with
these
neither
himself
he receives
334261	the
brothers
and
those
purposing
he forbids
and
334269	from
334271	the

he casts [them] out
Beloved

and
335299	the

335305	in
[the] Spirit
335308	on
335310	the
335312	Lordâs
day
and
I heard
335317	behind
me
335320	a voice
loud
335323	like that
of a trumpet
saying
What
you see
write
335330	in
a book
and
send
335335	to the
335337	seven
335339	churches

335361	to
Philadelphia
and
335365	to
Laodicea
And
I turned
to see
335371	the
voice
that
was speaking
335376	with
me
And
having turned
I saw
335382	seven
335384	lampstands
golden
and
335388	in
335390	[the] midst
335392	of the
lampstands
335395	[One] like
335398	[the] Son
of Man
having been clothed
to the feet
and
having been girded about
335405	at
335407	the
breasts
335410	with a sash
golden
335413	-
And
335416	the head
of Him
and
335420	the
hairs
[are] white
as if
wool
white
as
snow
and
335430	the
335432	eyes
of Him
335435	[are] like
335437	a flame
of fire
and
335441	the
335443	feet
of Him
[are] like
335447	fine bronze
as
335450	in
a furnace
having been refined
and
335455	the
335457	voice
of Him
[is] like
335461	[the] voice
335463	of waters
many
and
He is holding
335468	in
335470	the
335472	right
335474	hand
of Him
335477	stars
seven
and
335481	out of
335483	the
335485	mouth
of Him
335489	a sword
two-edged
sharp
is going forth
and
335495	the
335497	face
of Him
[is] like
335501	the
sun
shining
335505	in
335507	the
335509	full strength
of it
And
when
I saw
Him
I fell
335517	at
335519	the
335521	feet
of Him
335524	as though
dead
And
He placed
335529	the
335531	right hand
of Him
335534	upon
me
saying
Not
fear
I
am
335542	the
First
and
335546	the
Last
and
the
Living [One]

I was
dead
and
behold
335557	living
I am
335560	to
335562	the
335564	ages
335566	of the

I have

Death

Hades

337125	with

to sit

Me
337136	on

a door
was standing open

337184	-

and
337188	the
337190	voice
337192	-

that
I heard

Come up
here
and
I will show
to you
what
it behooves
to take place
337213	after
these things
Immediately
I was
337218	in
[the] Spirit
and
behold
a throne
was set
337225	in
337227	-
heaven
and
337231	upon
337233	the
throne
[One] sitting
and
the [One]

[was] like
in appearance
stone
jasper
and
sardius
And
337247	a rainbow
337249	[was] around
337251	the
throne
like
in appearance
an emerald
And
337258	around
337260	the
throne
337263	thrones
337265	[were] twenty
four
and
337269	on
337271	the

337275	twenty
four
elders
sitting
having been clothed
337281	in
337283	garments

and
337287	on
337289	the
337291	heads
of them
337294	crowns
golden
And
337298	out of
337300	the
throne
come
flashes of lightning
and
voices
and
thunderings
And
337310	[there were] seven
337312	lamps
of fire
burning
337316	before
337318	the
throne
which
are
337323	the
337325	seven
337327	Spirits
337329	-
of God
And
337333	before
337335	the
throne
337338	[was something] like
337341	a sea
of glass
like
crystal
And
337347	in
337349	[the] midst
337351	of the
throne
and
337355	around
337357	the
throne
337360	[were] four
337362	living creatures
being full
of eyes
in front
and
behind
And
337370	the
337372	living creature
337374	-
first
[was] like
a lion
and
337380	the
337382	second
living creature
like
a calf
and
337388	the
337390	third
living creature
having
337394	the
337396	face
337398	as
of a man
and
337402	the
337404	fourth
living creature
like
337408	an eagle
flying
And
337412	the
337414	four
living creatures
337417	one
337419	for
337421	one
of them
had
respectively
337426	wings
six
all around
and
within
full
of eyes
and
rest
not
they have
day
and
night
saying
Holy
Holy
Holy

337446	-
God
337449	-
Almighty
the [One]
having been
and
the [One]

and
the [One]
coming
And
whenever
will give
337463	the
living creatures
glory
and
honor
and
thanksgiving
to the [One]
sitting
337473	upon
337475	the
throne
the [One]
living
337480	to
337482	the
337484	ages
337486	of the
ages
will fall
337490	the
337493	twenty
four
elders
337497	before
the [One]
sitting
337501	upon
337503	the
throne
and
they will worship
the [One]
living
337510	to
337512	the
337514	ages
337516	of the
ages
and
they will cast
337521	the
337523	crowns
of them
337526	before
337528	the
throne
saying
Worthy
are You
337535	the
Lord
and
337539	-
God
of us
to receive
337544	-
glory
and
337548	-
honor
and
337552	-
power
for
You
created
337558	-
all things
and
337562	because of
337564	the
337566	will
of You
they existed
and
were created
And
I saw
337574	on
337576	the
337578	right hand
of the [One]
sitting
337582	upon
337584	the
throne
337588	a scroll
having been written
inside
and
on [the] back
having been sealed
337595	with seals
seven
And
I saw
337600	an angel
strong
proclaiming
337604	in
337606	a voice
loud
Who is
worthy
to open
337612	the
scroll
and
to break
337617	the
337619	seals
of it
And
337623	no one
was able
337626	in
337628	-
heaven
nor
337632	upon
337634	the
earth
nor
337638	under
337640	the
earth
to open
337644	the
scroll
nor
to see
it
And
was weeping
loudly
because
337654	no one
worthy
was found
to open
337659	the
scroll
nor
to see
it
And
337666	one
337668	of
337670	the
elders
says
to me
Not
do weep
Behold
has overcome
337679	the
Lion
337682	-
337684	of
337686	the
337688	tribe
of Judah
337691	the
337693	root
of David
to open
337697	the
scroll
and
337701	the
337703	seven
337705	seals
of it
And
I saw
337710	in
337712	[the] midst
337714	of the
throne
and
337718	of the
337720	four
living creatures
and
337724	in
337726	[the] midst
337728	of the
elders
a Lamb
standing
as
having been slain
having
337736	horns
seven
and
337740	eyes
seven
which
are
337745	the
337747	seven
337750	Spirits
337752	-
of God
having been sent out
337756	into
337758	all
337760	the
earth
And
He came
and
took [it]
337767	out of
337769	the
337771	right hand
of the [One]
sitting
337775	on
337777	the
throne
And
when
He had taken
337783	the
scroll
337786	the
337788	four
living creatures
and
337792	the
337795	twenty
four
elders
fell down
337800	before
337802	the
Lamb
having
each
a harp
and
337810	bowls
golden
being full
of incenses
which
are
337817	the
337819	prayers
337821	of the
saints
And
they are singing
337826	a song
new
saying
Worthy
are You
to take
337833	the
scroll
and
to open
337838	the
337840	seals
of it
because
You were slain
and
You purchased
337847	-
to God
337850	by
337852	the
337854	blood
of You
337857	out of
337859	every
tribe
and
tongue
and
people
and
nation
and
You have made
them
337871	to the
337873	God
of us
a kingdom
and
priests
and
they will reign
337881	upon
337883	the
earth
And
I looked
and
I heard
337890	[the] voice
337892	of angels
many
337895	around
337897	the
throne
and
337901	of the
living creatures
and
337905	of the
elders
and
was
337910	the
337912	number
of them
337915	myriads
of myriads
and
337919	thousands
of thousands
saying
337923	in a voice
loud
Worthy
is
337928	the
Lamb
-
having been slain
to receive
337934	the
power
and
riches
and
wisdom
and
strength
and
honor
and
glory
and
blessing
And
337950	every
creature
which
337954	in
337956	-
heaven
and
337960	upon
337962	the
earth
and
337966	under
337968	the
earth
and
337972	on
337974	the
sea
is
and
337979	-
337982	in
them
everything
I heard
saying
To the [One]
sitting
337990	on
337992	the
throne
and
337996	to the
Lamb
337999	-
blessing
and
338003	-
honor
and
338007	-
glory
and
338011	-
might
338014	to
338016	the
338018	ages
338020	of the
ages
And
338024	the
338026	four
living creatures
kept saying
Amen
And
338032	the
elders
fell down
and
worshiped
And
I watched
when
opened
338042	the
Lamb
338045	one
338047	of
338049	the
338051	seven
seals
and
I heard
338056	one
338058	of
338060	the
338062	four
living creatures
saying
338066	like
338068	a voice
of thunder
Come
And
I looked
and
behold
338076	a horse
white
and
the [one]
sitting
338082	on
it
having
a bow
and
was given
to him
a crown
and
he went forth
overcoming
and
that
he might conquer
And
when
He opened
338100	the
338102	seal
338104	-
second
I heard
338108	the
338110	second
living creature
saying
Come
And
went forth
338117	another
338119	horse
bright red
and
to the [one]
sitting
338125	on
it
was granted
to him
to take
338131	the
peace
338134	from
338136	the
earth
and
that
one another
they will slay
and
was given
to him
338146	a sword
great
And
when
He opened
338152	the
338154	seal
338156	-
third
I heard
338160	the
338162	third
living creature
saying
Come
And
I looked
and
behold
338171	a horse
black
and
the [one]
sitting
338177	on
it
having
a pair of scales
338182	in
338184	the
338186	hand
of him
And
I heard
[something] like
a voice
338193	in
338195	[the] midst
338197	of the
338199	four
living creatures
saying
338203	A choenix
of wheat
for a denarius
and
338208	three
338210	choenixes
of barley
for a denarius
and
338215	the
oil
and
338219	the
wine
not
you should injure
And
when
He opened
338227	the
338229	seal
338231	-
fourth
I heard
338235	[the] voice
338237	of the
338239	fourth
living creature
saying
Come
And
I looked
and
behold
338248	a horse
pale
and
the [one]
sitting
338254	on
it
[the] name
of him [was]
338259	-
Death
and
338263	-
Hades
was following
338267	with
him
and
was given
to them
authority
338274	over
338276	the
338278	fourth
338280	of the
earth
to kill
338284	with
sword
and
338288	with
famine
and
338292	with
plague
and
338296	by
338298	the
338300	beasts
338302	of the
earth
And
when
He opened
338308	the
338310	fifth
seal
I saw
338314	under
338316	the
altar
338319	the
338321	souls
of those
having been slain
338325	because of
338327	the
338329	word
338331	-
of God
and
338335	because of
338337	the
testimony
which
they had upheld
And
they were crying
338344	in a voice
loud
saying
338348	Until
when
338351	O
338353	Lord
338355	-
holy
and
true
not
do You judge
and
avenge
338364	the
338366	blood
of us
338369	from
those
dwelling
338373	upon
338375	the
earth
And
were given
338380	to them
each
338383	robes
white
and
it was said
to them
that
they shall rest
yet
338392	a time
little
until
would be fulfilled
338397	also
338399	the
338401	fellow servants
of them
and
338405	the
338407	brothers
of them
those
being about
to be killed
as
338414	also [had been]
they
And
I saw
when
He opened
338421	the
338423	seal
338425	-
sixth
and
338429	an earthquake
great
there was
and
338434	the
sun
became
black
338439	as
338441	sackcloth
of hair
and
338446	the
moon
whole
became
338451	like
blood
and
338455	the
338457	stars
338459	of
heaven
fell
338463	to
338465	the
earth
as
a fig tree
casts
338471	the
338473	unripe figs
of it
338476	by
338478	a wind
great
being shaken
And
338483	-
heaven
departed
like
a scroll
being rolled up
and
338491	every
mountain
and
island
338496	out of
338498	the
338500	places
of them
were moved
And
338505	the
338507	kings
338509	of the
earth
and
338513	the
great ones
and
338517	the
commanders
and
338521	the
rich
and
338525	the
powerful
and
338529	every
slave
and
free
hid
themselves
338536	in
338538	the
caves
and
338542	among
338544	the
338546	rocks
338548	of the
mountains
And
they say
338553	to the
mountains
and
338557	to the
rocks
Fall
338561	on
us
and
hide
us
338567	from
338569	[the] face
of the [One]
sitting
338573	on
338575	the
throne
and
338579	from
338581	the
338583	wrath
338585	of the
Lamb
because
has come
338590	the
338593	day
338595	-
great
338598	of the
338600	wrath
of Them
and
who
is able
to stand
338607	After
these things
I saw
338611	four
angels
standing
338615	upon
338617	the
338619	four
338621	corners
338623	of the
earth
holding
338627	the
338629	four
338631	winds
338633	of the
earth
so that
no
would blow
wind
338640	on
338642	the
earth
nor
338646	on
338648	the
sea
nor
338652	on
338654	any
tree
And
I saw
338659	another
angel
having ascended
338663	from
338665	[the] rising
of [the] sun
having
338669	[the] seal
338671	of God
[the] living
And
he cried
338676	in a voice
loud
338679	to the
338681	four
angels
to whom
it had been given
to them
to harm
338688	the
earth
and
338692	the
sea
saying
Not
harm
338698	the
earth
nor
338702	the
sea
nor
338706	the
trees
until
we shall have sealed
338711	the
338713	servants
338715	of the
338717	God
of us
338720	on
338722	the
338724	foreheads
of them
And
I heard
338729	the
338731	number
of those
having been sealed
338736	one hundred
forty
four
thousand
having been sealed
338742	out of
338744	every
338746	tribe
338748	of [the] sons
of Israel
338751	Out of
338753	[the] tribe
of Judah
338756	twelve
thousand
having been sealed
338760	out of
338762	[the] tribe
of Reuben
338765	twelve
thousand
338768	out of
338770	[the] tribe
of Gad
338773	twelve
thousand
338776	out of
338778	[the] tribe
of Asher
338781	twelve
thousand
338784	out of
338786	[the] tribe
of Naphtali
338789	twelve
thousand
338792	out of
338794	[the] tribe
of Manasseh
338797	twelve
thousand
338800	out of
338802	[the] tribe

338808	out of
338810	[the] tribe
of Levi
338813	twelve
thousand
338816	out of
338818	[the] tribe
of Isaachar
338821	twelve
thousand
338824	out of
338826	[the] tribe
of Zebulun
338829	twelve
thousand
338832	out of
338834	[the] tribe
of Joseph
338837	twelve
thousand
338840	out of
338842	[the] tribe
of Benjamin
338845	twelve
thousand
having been sealed
338849	After
these things
I looked
and
behold
338856	a multitude
great
which
to number
it
no one
was able
338864	out of
338866	every
nation
and
tribes
and
peoples
and
tongues
standing
338876	before
338878	the
throne
and
338882	before
338884	the
Lamb
having been clothed with
338888	robes
white
and
palm branches
338893	in
338895	the
338897	hands
of them
And
they were crying out
338902	in a voice
loud
saying
338906	-
Salvation
338909	to the
338911	God
of us
the [One]
sitting
338916	on
338918	the
throne
and
338922	to the
Lamb
And
338926	all
338928	the
angels
stood
338932	around
338934	the
throne
and
338938	the
elders
and
338942	the
338944	four
living creatures
and
they fell
338949	before
338951	the
throne
338954	upon
338956	the
338958	faces
of them
and
worshiped
338963	-
God
saying
Amen
338968	-
Blessing
and
338972	-
glory
and
338976	-
wisdom
and
338980	-
thanksgiving
and
338984	-
honor
and
338988	-
power
and
338992	-
strength
338995	to the
338997	God
of us
339000	to
339002	the
339004	ages
339006	of the
ages
Amen
And
answered
339012	one
339014	of
339016	the
elders
saying
to me
These
-
having been clothed with
339024	the
339026	robes
339028	-
white
who
are they
and
from where
have they come
And
I said
to him
339039	Lord
of me
you
know
And
he said
to me
These
are
the [ones]
coming
339051	out of
339053	the
339055	tribulation
339057	-
great
and
they have washed
339062	the
339064	robes
of them
and
made white
them
339070	in
339072	the
339074	blood
339076	of the
Lamb
339079	Because of
this
They are
339083	before
339085	the
339087	throne
339089	-
of God
and
serve
Him
day
and
night
339098	in
339100	the
339102	temple
of Him
and
the [One]
sitting
339108	on
339110	the
throne
will tabernacle
339114	over
them
Not
they will hunger
any more
neither
will they thirst
anymore
nor
at all
shall fall
339126	upon
them
339129	the
sun
nor
339133	any
scorching heat
because
339137	the
Lamb
339140	-
339142	in the
339144	center
339146	of the
throne
will shepherd
them
and
He will lead
them
339154	to
339156	living
339158	fountains
of waters
and
will wipe away
339163	-
God
339166	every
tear
339169	from
339171	the
339173	eyes
of them
And
when
He opened
339179	the
339181	seal
339183	-
seventh
there was
silence
339188	in
339190	-
heaven
339193	for about
half an hour
And
I saw
339198	the
339200	seven
angels
who
339204	before
339206	-
God
stand
and
were given
to them
339213	seven
trumpets
And
339217	another
angel
came
and
stood
339223	at
339225	the
altar
having
339229	a censer
golden
and
was given
to him
339235	incense
much
that
he will offer [it]
339240	with the
339242	prayers
339245	of the
saints
all
339249	upon
339251	the
339253	altar
339255	-
golden
339258	-
339260	before
339262	the
throne
And
went up
339267	the
339269	smoke
339271	of the
incense
339274	with the
339276	prayers
339278	of the
saints
339281	out of
339283	[the] hand
339285	of the
angel
339288	before
339290	-
God
And
took
339295	the
angel
339298	the
censer
and
filled
it
339304	from
339306	the
339308	fire
339310	of the
altar
and
cast [it]
339315	to
339317	the
earth
and
there were
thunders
and
rumblings
and
flashes of lightning
and
an earthquake
And
339330	the
339332	seven
angels
-
having
339337	the
339339	seven
trumpets
prepared
themselves
that
they might sound the trumpets
And
339347	the
first
sounded [his] trumpet
and
there was
hail
and
fire
having been mixed
339357	with
blood
and
it was cast
339362	upon
339364	the
earth
And
339368	a
339370	third
339372	of
the earth
was burned up
and
339377	a
339379	third
339381	of the
trees
were burned up
and
339386	all
339388	[the] grass
green
was burned up
And
339393	the
339395	second
angel
sounded [his] trumpet
and
339400	[something] like
339403	a mountain
great
with fire
burning
was cast
339409	into
339411	the
sea
And
became
339416	a
339418	third
339420	of the
sea
blood
and
died
339426	a
339428	third
339430	of the
creatures
339433	-
339435	in
339437	the
sea
-
having
life
and
339444	a
339446	third
339448	of the
ships
were destroyed
And
339453	the
339455	third
angel
sounded [his] trumpet
and
fell
339461	out of
339463	-
heaven
339466	a star
great
burning
like
a torch
And
it fell
339474	upon
339476	a
339478	third
339480	of the
rivers
and
339484	upon
339486	the
339488	springs
339490	of
waters
And
339494	the
339496	name
339498	the
star
is called
339502	-
Wormwood
And
became
339507	a
339509	third
339511	of the
waters
339514	into
wormwood
and
339518	many
339520	of the
men
died
339524	from
339526	the
waters
because
they were made bitter
And
339532	the
339534	fourth
angel
sounded [his] trumpet
and
was struck
339540	a
339542	third
339544	of the
sun
and
339548	a
339550	third
339552	of the
moon
and
339556	a
339558	third
339560	of the
stars
so that
should be darkened
339565	a
339567	third
of them
and
339571	the
day
not
should appear [for]
339576	a
339578	third
of it
and
339582	the
night
likewise
And
I looked
and
I heard
339590	one
eagle
flying
339594	in
mid-heaven
saying
339598	in a voice
loud
Woe
Woe
Woe
to those
dwelling
339606	on
339608	the
earth
339611	because of
339613	the
339615	remaining
339617	voices
339619	of the
339621	trumpet
339623	of the
339625	three
angels
-
being about
to sound [their] trumpets
And
339632	the
339634	fifth
angel
sounded [his] trumpet
and
I saw
a star
339641	out of
339643	-
heaven
having fallen
339647	to
339649	the
earth
and
was given
to it
339655	the
339657	key
339659	of the
339661	pit
339663	of the
abyss
And
he opened
339668	the
339670	pit
339672	of the
abyss
and
went up
smoke
339678	out of
339680	the
pit
like
339684	[the] smoke
339686	of a furnace
great
and
were darkened
339691	the
sun
and
339695	the
air
339698	by
339700	the
339702	smoke
339704	of the
pit
And
339708	out of
339710	the
smoke
came forth
locusts
339715	unto
339717	the
earth
and
was given
to them
power
like
have
power
339727	the
339729	scorpions
339731	of the
earth
And
it was said
to them
that
not
they shall harm
339740	the
339742	grass
339744	of the
earth
nor
339748	any
green thing
nor
339752	any
tree
if
not
339757	the
men
-
not
having
339763	the
339765	seal
339767	-
of God
339770	on
339772	the
foreheads
And
it was granted
to them
that
not
they should kill
them
but
that
they shall torment [them]
339785	months
five
And
339789	the
339791	torment
of them
339794	[was] like
339796	torment
of a scorpion
when
it might strike
a man
And
339803	in
339806	the
days
those
will seek
339811	-
men
339814	-
death
and
339818	not
no more
will find
it
and
they will long
to die
and
shall flee
339828	-
death
339831	from
them
And
339835	the
339837	appearance
339839	of the
locusts [was]
like
339843	horses
having been prepared
339846	for
battle
and
339850	upon
339852	the
339854	heads
of them
339857	[were something] like
crowns
like
gold
and
339863	the
339865	faces
of them
339868	like
339870	[the] faces
of men
And
they had
339875	hair
339877	like
339879	hair
of women
and
339883	the
339885	teeth
of them
339888	like [those]
of lions
were
And
they had
339894	breastplates
339896	like
339898	breastplates
of iron
and
339902	the
339904	sound
339906	of the
339908	wings
of them
339911	[was] as
339913	[the] sound
339915	of chariots
339918	of horses
many
rushing
339922	into
battle
And
they have
tails
like
scorpions
and
stingers
and
339933	in
339935	the
339937	tails
of them
339940	[is] the
339942	power
of them
to injure
339946	-
men
339949	for months
five
They have
339953	over
them
a king
339957	the
339959	angel
339961	of the
abyss
339964	[The] name
of Him
in Hebrew
[is] Abaddon
and
339970	in
339972	the
Greek
[the] name
he has
Apollyon
339978	-
339980	Woe
339982	the
first
has passed
Behold
are coming
still
339989	two
woes
339992	after
these things
And
339996	the
339998	sixth
angel
sounded [his] trumpet
and
I heard
340004	voice
one
340007	from
340009	the
340011	four
340013	horns
340015	of the
340017	altar
340019	-
golden
340022	-
340024	before
340026	-
God
saying
340030	to the
340032	sixth
angel
the [one]
having
340037	the
trumpet
Release
340041	the
340043	four
angels
those
having been bound
340048	at
340050	the
340052	river
340054	-
great
Euphrates
And
were released
340060	the
340062	four
angels
-
having been prepared
340067	for
340069	the
hour
and
day
and
month
and
year
so that
they might kill
340080	a
340082	third
340084	-
of mankind
And
340088	the
340090	number
340092	of the
340094	armies
340096	of the
cavalry [was]
340099	twice ten thousand
ten thousands
I heard
340103	the
340105	number
of them
And
thus
I saw
340111	the
horses
340114	in
340116	the
vision
and
those
sitting
340122	on
them
having
340126	breastplates
fiery
and
hyacinthine
and
brimstone
And
340134	the
340136	heads
340138	of the
horses [were]
340141	like
340143	heads
of lions
and
340147	out of
340149	the
340151	mouths
of them
proceed
fire
and
smoke
and
brimstone
340160	By
340163	-
340165	three
plagues
these
was killed
340170	a
340172	third
340174	of
mankind
340177	by
340179	the
fire
and
340183	by the
smoke
and
340187	by the
brimstone
-
proceeding
340192	out of
340194	the
340196	mouths
of them
340199	The
for
340202	powers
340204	of the
horses
340207	in
340209	the
340211	mouths
of them
are
and
340216	in
340218	the
340220	tails
of them
340223	the
for
340226	tails
of them
[are] like
serpents
having
heads
and
340234	with
them
they injure

340239	
340241	
340243	




340249	
340252	




340258	
340260	
340262	
340264	
340266	




340272	


340276	
340278	
340280	


340284	


340288	


340292	


340296	









And
not
they repented
340310	of
340312	the
340314	murders
of them
nor
340318	of
340320	the
340322	sorceries
of them
nor
340326	of
340328	the
340330	sexual immorality
of them
nor
340334	of
340336	the
340338	thefts
of them
And
I saw
340343	another
340345	angel
mighty
coming down
340349	out of
340351	-
heaven
clothed with
a cloud
and
340357	a
rainbow
340360	upon
340362	the
340364	head
of him
and
340368	the
340370	face
of him
340373	[was] like
340375	the
sun
and
340379	the
340381	feet
of him
340384	like
340386	pillars
of fire
and
having
340391	in
340393	the
340395	hand
of him
340398	a little scroll
being open
And
he placed
340403	the
340406	foot
of him
340409	-
right
340412	upon
340414	the
sea
340417	the
and
left
340421	upon
340423	the
earth
And
he cried out
340428	in a voice
loud
as
a lion
roars
And
when
he cried out
sounded
340438	the
340440	seven
thunders
340443	the
340445	of themselves
voice
And
when
had spoken
340451	the
340453	seven
thunders
I was about
to write
But
I heard
a voice
340461	out of
340463	-
heaven
saying
Seal
what
have spoken
340470	the
340472	seven
thunders
and
not
them
write
And
340480	the
angel
whom
I saw
standing
340486	on
340488	the
sea
and
340492	on
340494	the
land
lifted up
340498	the
340501	hand
of him
340504	the
right
340507	to
340509	-
heaven
and
he swore
340514	by
the [One]
living
340518	to
340520	the
340522	ages
340524	of the
ages
who
created
340529	-
heaven
and
340533	the things
340535	in
it
and
340539	the
earth
and
340543	the things
340545	in
it
and
340549	the
sea
and
340553	the things
340555	in
it
-
Delay
no longer
will there be
But
340563	in
340565	the
340567	days
340569	of the
340571	voice
340573	of the
340575	seventh
angel
when
he is about
to sound [the] trumpet
then
would be completed
340583	the
340585	mystery
340587	-
of God
as
proclaimed
340592	the
340594	of Himself
servants
340597	the
prophets
And
340601	the
voice
that
I heard
340606	out of
340608	-
heaven
again
was speaking
340613	with
me
and
saying
Go
take
340620	the
little scroll
-
having been opened
340625	in
340627	the
340629	hand
340631	of the
angel
-
standing
340636	upon
340638	the
sea
and
340642	upon
340644	the
land
And
I went
340649	to
340651	the
angel
saying
to him
Give
me
340658	the
little scroll
And
he says
to me
Take
and
eat
it
and
it will make bitter
340670	your
340672	-
stomach
but
340676	in
340678	the
340680	mouth
of you
it will be
sweet
as
honey
And
I took
340689	the
little scroll
340692	out of
340694	the
340696	hand
340698	of the
angel
and
I ate
it
and
it was
340706	in
340708	the
340710	mouth
of me
340713	as
honey
sweet
and
when
I had eaten
it
was made bitter
340722	the
340724	stomach
of me
And
they say
to me
It is necessary
for you
again
to prophesy
340734	concerning
340736	peoples
and
nations
and
tongues
and
kings
many
And
was given
to me
a measuring rod
like
a staff
saying
Rise
and
measure
340755	the
340757	temple
340759	-
of God
and
340763	the
altar
and
those
worshiping
340769	in
it
And
340773	the
courtyard
340777	-
outside
340780	the
temple
leave
out
and
not
it
measure
because
it has been given [up]
340791	to the
nations
and
340795	the
340797	city
340799	-
holy
they will trample upon
340803	months
forty
two
And
I will grant
340809	to the
340811	two
340813	witnesses
of me
and
they will prophesy
340818	days
a thousand
two hundred
sixty
clothed in
sackcloth
These
are
340827	the
340829	two
olive trees
and
340833	the
340835	two
lampstands
-
340839	before
340841	the
340843	Lord
340845	of the
earth
standing
And
if
anyone
them
should desire
to harm
fire
goes out
340857	of
340859	the
340861	mouth
of them
and
devours
340866	the
340868	enemies
of them
And
if
anyone
should desire
them
to harm
thus
it is necessary
for him
to be killed
These
have
340883	the
power
to shut
340887	the
sky
so that
no
rain
shall fall
340894	in the
340896	days
340898	of the
340900	prophecy
of them
and
power
they have
340906	over
340908	the
waters
to turn
them
340913	into
blood
and
to strike
340918	the
earth
340921	with
340923	every
plague
as often as
if
they might desire
And
when
they shall have completed
340932	the
340934	testimony
of them
340937	the
beast
-
coming up
340942	out of
340944	the
abyss
will make
340948	with
them
war
and
will overcome
them
and
will kill
them
And
340959	the
340961	body
of them
340964	[will be] upon
340966	the
340968	street
340970	of
340972	city
340974	the
great
which
is called
figuratively
Sodom
and
Egypt
where
340984	also
340986	the
340988	Lord
of them
was crucified
And
gaze
340994	[those] of
340996	the
peoples
and
tribes
and
tongues
and
nations
341005	upon the
341007	bodies
of them
341010	days
three
and
a half
and
341016	the
341018	bodies
of them
not
they will allow
to be put
341024	into
a tomb
And
those
dwelling
341030	on
341032	the
earth
rejoice
341036	over
them
and
make merry
and
gifts
will send
to one another
because
341046	these
341048	-
341050	two
prophets
have tormented
those
dwelling
341056	upon
341058	the
earth
And
341062	after
341064	the
341066	three
days
and
a half
341071	[the] spirit
of life
341074	from
341076	-
God
entered
341080	into
them
and
they stood
341085	upon
341087	the
341089	feet
of them
and
341093	fear
great
fell
341097	upon
those
beholding
them
And
they heard
341104	a voice
great
341107	out of
341109	-
heaven
saying
to them
Come up
here
And
they went up
341118	to
341120	-
heaven
341123	in
341125	the
cloud
and
beheld
them
341131	the
341133	enemies
of them
And
341137	in
341139	that
341141	-
hour
there was
341145	an earthquake
great
and
341149	a
341151	tenth
341153	of the
city
fell
and
were killed
341159	in
341161	the
earthquake
341164	names
of men
341167	thousand
seven
And
341171	the
rest
terrified
became
and
gave
glory
341179	to the
341181	God
341183	of
heaven
341186	The
341188	woe
341190	-
second
has passed
Behold
341195	the
341197	woe
341199	-
third
is coming
quickly
And
341205	the
341207	seventh
angel
sounded [his] trumpet
and
there were
341213	voices
great
341216	in
341218	-
heaven
saying
Has become
341223	the
341225	kingdom
341227	of the
world
341230	[that] of the
341232	Lord
of us
and
341236	of the
341238	Christ
of Him
and
He will reign
341243	to
341245	the
341247	ages
341249	of the
ages
And
341253	the
341256	twenty
four
elders
-
341261	before
341263	-
God
sitting
341267	on
341269	the
341271	thrones
of them
fell
341275	upon
341277	the
341279	faces
of them
and
worshiped
341284	-
God
saying
We give thanks
to You
Lord
341291	-
God
341294	-
Almighty
the [One]
being
and
who
was
that
You have taken
341304	the
341307	power
of You
341310	-
great
and
have begun to reign
And
341316	the
nations
were enraged
and
came
341322	the
341324	wrath
of You
and
341328	the
341330	time
341332	for the
dead
to be judged
and
to give
341338	the
reward
341341	to the
341343	servants
of You
341346	the
prophets
and
341350	to the
saints
and
to those
fearing
341356	the
341358	name
of You
341361	the
small
and
341365	the
great
and
to destroy
those who
are destroying
341372	the
earth
And
was opened
341377	the
341379	temple
341381	-
of God
341384	-
341386	in
341388	-
heaven
and
was seen
341393	the
341395	ark
341397	of the
341399	covenant
of Him
341402	in
341404	the
341406	temple
of Him
And
there were
flashes of lightning
and
voices
and
thunders
and
an earthquake
and
341419	hail
great
And
341423	a sign
great
appeared
341427	in
341429	-
heaven
a woman
clothed with
341434	the
sun
and
341438	the
moon
341441	under
341443	the
341445	feet
of her
and
341449	on
341451	the
341453	head
of her
341456	a crown
341458	of stars
twelve
and
341462	in
womb
having
And
she cries out
being in travail
and
being in pain
to bring forth
And
was seen
341474	another
sign
341477	in
341479	-
heaven
and
behold
341485	a dragon
red
great
having
341490	heads
seven
and
341494	horns
ten
and
341498	upon
341500	the
341502	heads
of him
341505	seven
royal crowns
And
341509	the
341511	tail
of him
drags
341515	a
341517	third
341519	of the
341521	stars
341523	of
heaven
and
he cast
them
341529	to
341531	the
earth
And
341535	the
dragon
stands
341539	before
341541	the
woman
-
being about
to bring forth
so that
when
she should bring forth
341550	the
341552	child
of her
he might devour
And
she brought forth
341558	a son
male
who
is about
to rule
341564	all
341566	the
nations
341569	with
341571	a rod
of iron
and
was caught up
341576	the
341578	child
of her
341581	to
341583	-
God
and
341587	to
341589	the
341591	throne
of Him
And
341595	the
woman
fled
341599	into
341601	the
wilderness
where
she has
there
341607	a place
having been prepared
341610	by
341612	-
God
so that
there
they should nourish
her
341619	days
one thousand
two hundred
sixty
And
there was
war
341627	in
341629	-
heaven
341632	-
Michael
and
341636	the
341638	angels
of him
-
warred
341643	against
341645	the
dragon
and
341649	the
dragon
warred [back]
and
341654	the
341656	angels
of him
And
not
had he strength
nor
341663	a place
was found
for them
any longer
341668	in
341670	-
heaven
And
was thrown [out]
341675	the
341677	dragon
341679	-
great
341682	the
341684	serpent
341686	-
ancient
who
is called
[the] devil
and
341693	-
Satan
-
deceiving
341699	the
inhabited [world]
whole
He was thrown down
341704	to
341706	the
earth
and
341710	the
341712	angels
of him
341715	with
him
were thrown down
And
I heard
341721	a voice
great
341724	in
341726	-
heaven
saying
Now
have come
341732	the
salvation
and
341736	the
power
and
341740	the
341742	kingdom
341744	of the
341746	God
of us
and
341750	the
341752	authority
341754	the
341756	Christ
of Him
because
has been thrown down
341761	the
341763	accuser
341765	of the
341767	brothers
of us
the [one]
accusing
them
341773	before
341775	the
341777	God
of us
day
and
night
And
they
have overcome
him
341787	by reason
341789	of the
341791	blood
341793	of the
Lamb
and
341797	by reason of
341799	the
341801	word
341803	of the
341805	testimony
of them
and
not
they have loved
341811	the
341813	life
of them
341816	unto
death
341819	Because of
this
rejoice
heavens
and
those
341826	in
them
dwelling
Woe to
341831	the
earth
and
341835	the
sea
because
has come down
341840	the
devil
341843	to
you
having
341847	fury
great
knowing
that
341852	a short
time
he has
And
when
saw
341859	the
dragon
that
he had been thrown down
341864	to
341866	the
earth
he pursued
341870	the
woman
who
had brought forth
341875	the
male [child]
And
were given
341880	to the
woman
341883	the
341885	two
341887	wings
341889	of the
341891	eagle
341893	-
great
so that
she could fly
341898	into
341900	the
wilderness
341903	into
341905	the
341907	place
of her
where
she is nourished
there
a time
and
times
and
341917	half
a time
341920	from
341922	[the] face
341924	of the
serpent
And
cast
341929	the
serpent
341932	out of
341934	the
341936	mouth
of him
341939	after
341941	the
woman
water
as
a river
so that
her
carried away by a flood
he might cause to be
And
helped
341953	the
earth
341956	the
woman
and
opened
341961	the
earth
341964	the
341966	mouth
of it
and
swallowed up
341971	the
river
which
had cast
341976	the
dragon
341979	out of
341981	the
341983	mouth
of him
And
was angry
341988	the
dragon
341991	with
341993	the
woman
and
went
to make
war
342000	with
342002	the
342004	rest
342006	of the
342008	children
of her
-
keeping
342013	the
342015	commandments
342017	-
of God
and
holding
342022	the
342024	testimony
of Jesus
And
he stood
342029	upon
342031	the
342033	sand
342035	of the
sea
And
I saw
342040	out of
342042	the
sea
a beast
rising
having
342048	horns
ten
and
342052	heads
seven
and
342056	on
342058	the
342060	horns
of it
342063	ten
royal crowns
and
342067	upon
342069	the
342071	heads
of it
342074	names
of blasphemy
And
342078	the
beast
that
I saw
was
like
a leopard
and
342087	the
342089	feet
of it
342092	like
a bearâs
and
342096	the
342098	mouth
of it
342101	like
342103	[the] mouth
of a lion
And
gave
to it
342109	the
dragon
342112	the
342114	power
of him
and
342118	the
342120	throne
of him
and
342124	authority
great
And
342128	one
342130	of
342132	the
342134	heads
of it
[was] as
having been slain
342139	to
death
And
342143	the
342145	wound
342147	of
342149	death
of it
was healed
and
marveled
342155	all
342157	the
earth
342160	after
342162	the
beast
And
they worshiped
342167	the
dragon
who
had given
342172	-
authority
342175	to the
beast
and
they worshiped
342180	the
beast
saying
Who
[is] like
342186	the
beast
And
who
is able
to make war
342193	against
it
And
was given
to it
342199	a mouth
speaking
great things
and
blasphemy
and
was given
to it
authority
to act
342210	months
forty
two
And
it opened
342216	the
342218	mouth
of it
342221	unto
342223	blasphemies
342225	against
342227	-
God
to blaspheme
342231	the
342233	name
of Him
and
342237	the
342239	tabernacle
of Him
those
342243	in
342245	-
heaven
dwelling
And
there was given
to it
to make
war
342254	with
342256	the
saints
and
to overcome
them
And
was given
to it
authority
342266	over
342268	every
tribe
and
people
and
tongue
and
nation
And
will worship
it
342280	all
-
dwelling
342284	on
342286	the
earth
342289	of whom
not
have been written
342293	the
342295	names
of them
342298	in
342300	the
342302	book
342304	-
342306	of life
342308	of the
Lamb
-
having been slain
342313	from
342315	[the] founding
of [the] world
If
anyone
has
an ear
let him hear
If
anyone [is to go]
342325	into
captivity
342328	into
captivity
he goes
If
anyone
342334	with
[the] sword
is to be killed
it is necessary for
him
342340	by
[the] sword
to be killed
Here
is
342347	the
endurance
and
342351	the
faith
342354	of the
saints
And
I saw
342359	another
beast
rising
342363	out of
342365	the
earth
and
it had
342370	horns
two
342373	like
a lamb
and
it was speaking
like
a dragon
And
342382	the
342384	authority
342386	of the
342388	first
beast
all
it exercises
342393	on behalf
of it
and
causes
342398	the
earth
and
those
342403	in
it
dwelling
that
they will worship
342409	the
342411	beast
342413	-
first
of whom
had been healed
342418	the
342420	wound
342422	-
342424	fatal
of it
And
it works
342429	signs
great
so that
even
fire
it should cause
342436	out of
342438	-
heaven
to come down
342442	to
342444	the
earth
342447	in the presence
342449	-
of men
And
it deceives
those
dwelling
342456	on
342458	the
earth
342461	by reason of
342463	the
signs
that
were given
to it
to perform
342470	before
342472	the
beast
telling
those
dwelling
342478	on
342480	the
earth
to make
an image
342485	to the
beast
that
has
342490	the
342492	wound
342494	of the
sword
and
has lived
And
there was given
to it
to give
breath
342504	to the
342506	image
342508	of the
beast
so that
also
should speak
342514	the
342516	image
342518	of the
beast
and
should cause
that
as many as
if
not
would worship
342528	the
342530	image
342532	of the
beast
would be killed
And
it causes
all
342539	the
small
and
342543	the
great
and
342547	the
rich
and
342551	the
poor
and
342555	the
free
and
342559	the
servants
that
it should give
them
a mark
342566	on
342568	the
342571	hand
of them
342574	-
right
or
342578	on
342580	the
342582	forehead
of them
and
that
no
one
should be able
to buy
or
to sell
if
not
the [one]
having
342597	the
mark
342600	the
342602	name
342604	of the
beast
or
342608	the
342610	number
342612	of the
342614	name
of it
Here
342618	the
wisdom
is
The [one]
having
understanding
let him count
342626	the
342628	number
342630	of the
beast
342633	number
for
a manâs
it is
and
342639	the
342641	number [is]
of it
six hundred
sixty
six
And
I looked
and
behold
342651	the
Lamb
was standing
342655	upon
342657	-
342659	Mount
Zion
and
342663	with
Him
342667	one hundred
forty
four
thousand
having
342673	the
342675	name
of Him
and
342679	the
342681	name
342683	of the
342685	Father
of Him
having been written
342689	on
342691	the
342693	foreheads
of them
And
I heard
a voice
342699	out of
342701	-
heaven
as
342705	[the] sound
342707	of waters
many
and
as
342712	[the] sound
342714	of thunder
loud
And
342718	the
voice
that
I heard
342723	[was] like that
of harpists
harping
342727	with
342729	the
342731	harps
of them
And
they are singing
342736	a song
new
342739	before
342741	the
throne
and
342745	before
342747	the
342749	four
living creatures
and
342753	the
elders
And
no one
was able
to learn
342760	the
song
if
not
342765	the
342767	one hundred
forty
four
thousand
-
having been redeemed
342774	from
342776	the
earth
These
are
they who
342782	with
women
not
have not been defiled
pure
for
they are
these
-
following
342793	the
Lamb
wherever
-
He shall go
These
have been redeemed
342801	out from
342803	-
men
342806	[as] firstfruits
342808	-
to God
and
342812	to the
Lamb
And
342816	in
342818	the
342820	mouth
of them
not
was found
a lie
blameless
they are
And
I saw
342830	another
angel
flying
342834	in
mid-heaven
having
342838	[the] glad tidings
everlasting
to preach
342842	upon
those
dwelling
342846	on
342848	the
earth
and
342852	upon
342854	every
nation
and
tribe
and
tongue
and
people
saying
342864	in
342866	a voice
loud
Fear
342870	-
God
and
give
Him
glory
because
has come
342879	the
342881	hour
342883	of the
342885	judgment
of Him
And
worship
the [One]
having made
342892	-
heaven
and
342896	the
earth
and
sea
and
342902	springs
of waters
And
342906	another
angel
a second
followed
saying
Fallen
Fallen is
342914	Babylon
342916	the
great
who
342920	of
342922	the
342924	wine
342926	-
342928	of wrath
342930	for the
342932	immorality
of her
she has given to drink
342936	all
342938	the
Gentiles
And
342942	another
angel
a third
followed
them
saying
342949	in
342951	a voice
loud
If
anyone
worships
342957	the
beast
and
342961	the
342963	image
of it
and
receives
a mark
342969	on
342971	the
342973	forehead
of him
or
342977	upon
342979	the
342981	hand
of him
342984	also
he
will drink
342988	of
342990	the
342992	wine
342994	of the
342996	anger
342998	-
of God
-
having been mixed
undiluted
343004	in
343006	the
343008	cup
343010	of the
343012	wrath
of Him
and
he will be tormented
343017	in
fire
and
brimstone
343022	before
343024	[the] angels
holy
and
343028	before
343030	the
Lamb
And
343034	the
343036	smoke
343038	of the
343040	torment
of them
343043	to
343045	ages
of ages
goes up
and
not
have
rest
day
and
night
those
worshiping
343058	the
beast
and
343062	the
343064	image
of it
and
if
anyone
receives
343071	the
343073	mark
343075	of the
343077	name
of it
Here
343081	the
343083	endurance
343085	of the
saints
is
those
keeping
343091	the
343093	commandments
343095	-
of God
and
343099	the
343101	faith
of Jesus
And
I heard
a voice
343107	out of
343109	-
heaven
saying
Write
Blessed [are]
343115	the
dead
-
343119	in
the Lord
dying
from
Yes
says
343126	the
Spirit
so that
they will rest
343131	from
343133	the
343135	labors
of them
343138	-
for
343141	the works
of them
follow
343145	with
them
And
I looked
and
behold
343152	a cloud
white
and
343156	upon
343158	the
cloud
is sitting [One]
343162	like
343164	[the] Son
of Man
having
343168	on
343170	the
343172	head
of Him
343175	a crown
golden
and
343179	in
343181	the
343183	hand
of Him
343186	a sickle
sharp
And
343190	another
angel
came out
343194	of
343196	the
temple
crying
343200	in
343202	a voice
loud
to the [One]
sitting
343207	on
343209	the
cloud
Put forth
343213	the
343215	sickle
of You
and
reap
because
has come
343222	the
hour
to reap
because
has ripened
343228	the
343230	harvest
343232	of the
earth
And
swung
the [One]
sitting
343239	upon
343241	the
cloud
343244	the
343246	sickle
of Him
343249	upon
343251	the
earth
and
was harvested
343256	the
earth
And
343260	another
angel
came
343264	out of
343266	the
temple
343269	-
343271	in
343273	-
heaven
having
343277	also
he
343280	a sickle
sharp
And
343284	another
angel
came
343288	out of
343290	the
altar
-
having
authority
343296	over
343298	the
fire
and
he called
343303	in a voice
loud
to the [one]
having
343308	the
343310	sickle
343312	-
sharp
saying
Put forth
343317	your
343319	-
343321	sickle
343323	-
sharp
and
gather
343328	the
343330	clusters
343332	from the
343334	vine
343336	of the
earth
because
have fully ripened
343341	the
343343	grapes
of it
And
put forth
343348	the
angel
343351	the
343353	sickle
of him
343356	to
343358	the
earth
and
gathered
343363	the
343365	vine
343367	of the
earth
and
cast [them]
343372	into
343374	the
343377	winepress
343379	of the
343381	wrath
343383	-
of God
343386	-
great
And
was trodden
343391	the
winepress
343394	outside
343396	the
city
and
flowed
blood
343402	out of
343404	the
winepress
343407	as high as
343409	the
343411	bridles
343413	of the
horses
343416	to the distance of
343418	stadia
343420	one thousand
six hundred
And
I saw
343426	another
343428	sign
343430	in
343432	-
heaven
great
and
wonderful
343438	angels
seven
having
343443	plagues
seven
343446	the
last
because
343450	in
them
was completed
343454	the
343456	wrath
343458	-
of God
And
I saw
343463	[something] like
343465	a sea
of glass
mingled
with fire
and
those
conquering
343473	over
343475	the
beast
and
343479	of
343481	the
343483	image
of it
and
343487	over
343489	the
343491	number
343493	of the
343495	name
of it
standing
343499	upon
343501	the
343503	sea
343505	of the
glass
having
343509	harps
343511	-
of God
And
they are singing
343516	the
343518	song
of Moses
343521	the
343523	servant
343525	of
God
and
343529	the
343531	song
343533	of the
Lamb
saying
Great
and
wonderful [are]
343540	the
343542	works
of You
Lord
343546	-
God
343549	the
Almighty
Righteous
and
true [are]
343555	the
343557	ways
of You
343560	O
343562	King
343564	of the
nations
Who
343568	no
not
should fear [You]
O Lord
and
will glorify
343575	the
343577	name
of You
For [You]
alone [are]
holy
For
343584	all
343586	the
nations
will come
and
will worship
343592	before
You
because
343596	the
343598	righteous acts
of You
have been revealed
And
343603	after
these things
I looked
and
was opened
343609	the
343612	temple
343614	of the
343616	tabernacle
343618	of the
testimony
343621	in
343623	-
heaven
And
came forth
343628	the
343630	seven
angels
-
having
343635	the
343637	seven
plagues
343640	out
343642	of the
temple
having been clothed in
343647	linen
pure
bright
and
having been girded with
343653	around
343655	the
chests
343658	sashes
golden
And
343662	one
343664	of
343666	the
343668	four
living creatures
gave
343672	to the
343674	seven
angels
343677	seven
343680	bowls
golden
full
343684	of the
343686	wrath
343688	-
of God
the [One]
living
343693	to
343695	the
343697	ages
343699	of the
ages
And
was filled
343704	the
temple
with smoke
343708	from
343710	the
343712	glory
343714	-
of God
and
343718	from
343720	the
343722	power
of Him
and
no one
was able
to enter
343729	into
343731	the
temple
until
were completed
343736	the
343738	seven
343740	plagues
343742	of the
343744	seven
angels
And
I heard
343749	[a] loud
voice
343752	from
343754	the
temple
saying
343758	to the
343760	seven
angels
Go
and
pour out
343766	the
343768	seven
343770	bowls
343772	of the
343774	wrath
343776	-
of God
343779	into
343781	the
earth
And
departed
343786	the
first
and
poured out
343791	the
343793	bowl
of him
343796	into
343798	the
earth
and
came
343803	a sore
evil
and
grievous
343808	upon
343810	the
men
-
having
343815	the
343817	mark
343819	of the
beast
and
those
worshiping
343825	the
343827	image
of it
And
343831	the
second
poured out
343835	the
343837	bowl
of him
343840	into
343842	the
sea
and
it became
343847	blood
343849	as
of [one] dead
and
343853	every
343855	soul
living
died
343859	that was
343861	in
343863	the
sea
And
343867	the
third
poured out
343871	the
343873	bowl
of him
343876	into
343878	the
rivers
and
343882	the
343884	springs
343886	of the
waters
and
they became
blood
And
I heard
343894	the
343896	angel
343898	of the
waters
saying
Righteous
are You
the [One]
being
and
-
having been
343909	O
holy One
because
these things
You have judged
because
343916	[the] blood
of saints
and
of prophets
they have poured out
and
blood
to them
You have given
to drink
worthy
they are
And
I heard
343931	the
altar
saying
Yes
Lord
343937	-
God
343940	-
Almighty
true
and
righteous [are]
343946	the
343948	judgments
of You
And
343952	the
fourth
poured out
343956	the
343958	bowl
of him
343961	upon
343963	the
sun
and
there was given
to it
to scorch
343970	-
men
343973	with
fire
And
were scorched
343978	the
men
343981	with heat
great
and
they cursed
343986	the
343988	name
343990	-
of God
the [One]
having
343995	-
authority
343998	over
344001	the
plagues
these
and
not
did they repent
to give
Him
glory
And
344012	the
fifth
poured out
344016	the
344018	bowl
of him
344021	upon
344023	the
344025	throne
344027	of the
beast
and
became
344032	the
344034	kingdom
of it
darkened
and
they were gnawing
344040	the
344042	tongues
of them
344045	for
344047	the
distress
and
they cursed
344052	the
344054	God
344056	of
heaven
344059	on account of
344061	the
344063	distresses
of them
and
344067	on account of
344069	the
344071	sores
of them
and
not
they did repent
344077	of
344079	the
344081	works
of them
And
344085	the
sixth
poured out
344089	the
344091	bowl
of him
344094	upon
344096	the
river
344099	-
344101	great
Euphrates
and
was dried up
344106	the
344108	water
of it
so that
might be prepared
344113	the
344115	way
344117	of the
kings
344120	-
344122	of the
344124	rising
of the sun
And
I saw [coming]
344129	out of
344131	the
344133	mouth
344135	of the
dragon
and
344139	out of
344141	the
344143	mouth
344145	of the
beast
and
344149	out of
344151	the
344153	mouth
344155	of the
false prophet
344160	spirits
three
unclean
344164	like
frogs
they are
for
344170	spirits
of demons
performing
signs
which
go forth
344177	to
344179	the
344181	kings
344184	of the
inhabited [world]
whole
to gather together
them
344190	unto
344192	the
344194	battle
344196	of the
344199	day
344201	-
great
344204	-
of God
344207	the
Almighty
Behold
I am coming
like
a thief
Blessed [is]
the [one]
watching
and
keeping
344219	the
344221	garments
of him
so that
not
naked
he should walk
and
they might see
344230	the
344232	shame
of him
And
he gathered together
them
344238	unto
344240	the
place
-
called
in Hebrew
Armageddon
And
344248	the
seventh
poured out
344252	the
344254	bowl
of him
344257	upon
344259	the
air
and
came out
344264	a voice
loud
344267	from
344269	the
temple
344272	from
344274	the
throne
saying
It is done
And
there were
flashes of lightning
and
voices
and
thunders
and
344287	an earthquake
there was
great
such as
not
had there been
344294	since
-
men
were
344299	upon
344301	the
earth
344304	so great
[was the] earthquake
so
mighty
And
was [split]
344311	the
344313	city
344315	-
great
344318	into
344320	three
parts
and
344324	the
344326	cities
344328	of the
nations
fell
and
344333	Babylon
344335	the
great
was remembered
344339	before
344341	-
God
to give
her
344346	the
344348	cup
344350	of the
344352	wine
344354	of the
344356	fury
344358	the
344360	wrath
of Him
And
344364	every
island
fled
and
mountains
not
were to be found
And
344374	a hail
great
344377	about
a talent weight
comes down
344381	out of
344383	-
heaven
344386	upon
344388	the
men
And
blasphemed
344393	the
men
344396	-
God
344399	on account of
344401	the
344403	plague
344405	of the
hail
for
severe
is
344411	the
344413	plague
of it
exceedingly
And
came
344419	one
344421	of
344423	the
344425	seven
angels
-
having
344430	the
344432	seven
bowls
and
spoke
344437	with
me
saying
Come here
I will show
you
344444	the
344446	punishment
344448	of the
344450	prostitute
344452	-
great
the [one]
sitting
344457	upon
344459	waters
many
344462	with
whom
have committed sexual immorality
344466	the
344468	kings
344470	of the
earth
and
have been made drunk
those that
dwelling
344477	on the
earth
344480	with
344482	the
344484	wine
344486	of the
344488	sexual immorality
of her
And
he carried away
me
344494	into
a wilderness
344497	in
[the] Spirit
and
I saw
a woman
sitting
344504	upon
344508	a beast
scarlet
being full
344512	of names
of blasphemy
having
344516	heads
seven
and
344520	horns
ten
And
344524	the
woman
was
clothed in
purple
and
scarlet
and
adorned
with gold
and
344536	stone
precious
and
pearls
holding
344543	a cup
golden
344546	in
344548	the
344550	hand
of her
being full
of abominations
and
344556	the
344558	impurity
344560	of the
344562	sexual immorality
of her
And
344566	upon
344568	the
344570	forehead
of her
a name
was written
a mystery
344576	Babylon
344578	the
Great
344581	the
344583	mother
344585	of the
prostitutes
and
344589	of the
344591	abominations
344593	of the
earth
And
I saw
344598	the
woman
being drunk
344602	with
344604	the
344606	blood
344608	of the
saints
and
344612	with
344614	the
344616	blood
344618	of the
344620	witnesses
of Jesus
And
I marveled
having seen
her
344627	with wonder
great
And
said
to me
344633	the
angel
344636	Because of
why
did you marvel
I
will tell
you
344643	the
344645	mystery
344647	of the
woman
and
344651	of the
beast
-
carrying
her
-
having
344659	the
344661	seven
heads
and
344665	the
344667	ten
horns
344670	The
beast
that
you saw
was
and
not
is
and
is about
to come up
344682	out of
344684	the
abyss
and
344688	into
destruction
go
and
will wonder
those
dwelling
344696	on
344698	the
earth
344701	whose
not
are written
344705	-
names
344708	in
344710	the
344712	book
344714	-
of life
344717	from
344719	[the] foundation
of [the] world
seeing
344723	the
beast
which
was
and
not
is
and yet
will be
Here [is]
344734	the
mind
-
having
wisdom
344740	The
344742	seven
heads
344745	seven
mountains
are
where
344750	the
woman
sits
344754	on
them
And
344758	kings
seven
there are
344762	The
five
are fallen
344766	the
one
is
344770	the
other
not yet
has come
and
when
he shall have come
a little while
him
it behooves
to remain
And
344783	the
beast
which
was
and
not
is
344791	also
himself
an eighth
is
and
344797	of
344799	the
seven
is
and
344804	into
destruction
goes
And
344809	the
344811	ten
horns
which
you saw
344816	ten
kings
are
who
a kingdom
not yet
have received
but
authority
344826	as
kings
344829	one
hour
receive
344833	along with
344835	the
beast
These
344839	one
mind
have
and
344844	the
344846	power
and
authority
of themselves
344851	to the
beast
they shall give up
These
344856	with
344858	the
Lamb
war will make
and
344863	the
Lamb
will overcome
them
because
344869	Lord
of lords
He is
and
344874	King
of kings
and
344878	those
344880	with
Him
[are] called
and
chosen
and
faithful
And
he says
to me
344891	The
waters
that
you saw
where
344897	the
prostitute
sits
peoples
and
multitudes
are
and
nations
and
tongues
And
344910	the
344912	ten
horns
that
you saw
and
344918	the
beast
these
will hate
344923	the
prostitute
and
desolate
will make
her
and
naked
and
344933	the
344935	flesh
of her
they will eat
and
her
they will burn
344942	with
fire
344945	-
For
God
has put
344950	into
344952	the
344954	hearts
of them
to do
344958	the
344960	purpose
of Him
and
to do
344965	one
purpose
and
to give
344970	the
344972	kingdom
of them
344975	to the
beast
until
will be fulfilled
344980	the
344982	words
344984	-
of God
And
344988	the
woman
whom
you saw
is
344994	the
344996	city
344998	-
great
-
having
kingship
345004	over
345006	the
345008	kings
345010	of the
earth
345013	After
these things
I saw
345017	another
angel
descending
345021	out of
345023	-
heaven
having
345027	authority
great
and
345031	the
earth
was illuminated
345035	from
345037	the
345039	glory
of him
And
he cried out
345044	in
345046	a mighty
voice
saying
Fallen
Fallen is
345052	Babylon
345054	the
great
And
she has become
345059	a habitation
of demons
and
345063	a prison
345065	of every
345067	spirit
unclean
and
345071	a prison
345073	of every
345075	bird
unclean
and
having been hated
For
345081	of
345083	the
345085	wine
345087	of the
345089	wrath
345091	of the
345093	sexual immorality
of her
have drunk
345097	all
345099	the
nations
and
345103	the
345105	kings
345107	of the
earth
345110	with
her
have committed sexual immorality
and
345115	the
345117	merchants
345119	of the
earth
345122	through
345124	the
345126	power
345128	of the
345130	sensuality
of her
have been enriched
And
I heard
345136	another
voice
345139	from
345141	-
heaven
saying
Come
345146	the
345148	people
of me
345151	out of
her
so that
not
you may have fellowship
345157	in the
345159	sins
of her
and
345163	of
345165	the
345167	plagues
of her
so that
not
you may receive
For
have been heaped
345175	her
345177	-
sins
345180	as high as
345182	-
heaven
and
has remembered
345187	-
God
345190	the
345192	iniquities
of her
Give back
to her
as
345198	also
she
has rendered
and
pay back double
345204	to her
twofold
345207	according to
345209	the
345211	works
of her
345214	In
345216	the
cup
which
she has mixed
mix
to her
double
So much as
she has glorified
herself
and
lived in luxury
345229	as much
give
to her
torment
and
misery
because
345237	in
345239	the
345241	heart
of herself
she says
-
I sit
[as] a queen
and
a widow
never
I am
and
mourning
345254	never
not
shall I see
345258	Because of
this
345261	in
345263	one
day
will come
345267	the
345269	plagues
of her
death
and
misery
and
famine
and
345278	with
fire
she will be burned up
because
mighty [is the]
Lord
345285	-
God
the [One]
having judged
her
And
will weep
and
will wail
345295	for
her
345298	the
345300	kings
345302	of the

for
345812	the

of you
were
345818	the
345820	great ones
345822	of the
earth
because
345826	by
345828	the
345830	sorcery
of you
were deceived
345834	all
345836	the
nations
And
345840	in
her
345843	[the] blood
of prophets
and
of saints
was found
and
345850	of all
those
having been slain
345854	on
345856	the
earth
345859	After
these things
I heard
345863	[something] like
345866	a voice
loud
345869	of a multitude
great
345872	in
345874	-
heaven
crying out
Hallelujah
345879	The
salvation
and
345883	the
glory
and
345887	the
power
345890	to the
345892	God
of us
For
true
and
righteous [are]
345899	the
345901	judgments
of Him
because
He has judged
345906	the
345908	prostitute
345910	-
great
who
had corrupted
345915	the
earth
345918	with
345920	the
345922	sexual immorality
of her
and
He has avenged
345927	the
345929	blood
345931	of the
345933	servants
of Him
345936	out of
345938	[the] hand
of her
And
a second time
they said
Hallelujah
And
345946	the
345948	smoke
of her
goes up
345952	to
345954	the
345956	ages
345958	of the
ages
And
fell down
345963	the
345965	elders
345967	-
345969	twenty
four
and
345973	the
345975	four
living creatures
and
they worshiped
345980	-
God
the [One]
sitting
345985	on
345987	the
throne
saying
Amen
Hallelujah
And
a voice
345995	from
345997	the
throne
came forth
saying
Praise
346003	the
346005	God
of us
346008	all
346010	the
346012	servants
of Him
those
fearing
Him
346018	the
small
and
346022	the
great
And
I heard
346027	[something] like
346029	[the] voice
346031	of a multitude
great
and
346035	like
346037	[the] sound
346039	of waters
many
and
346043	like
346045	a sound
346047	of thunders
mighty
saying
Hallelujah
For
has reigned
[the] Lord
346055	-
346057	God
of us
346060	the
Almighty
We should rejoice
and
should exult
and
will give
346068	the
glory
to Him
because
has come
346074	the
346076	marriage
346078	of the
Lamb
and
346082	the
346084	bride
of Him
has made ready
herself
And
it was given
to her
that
she should be clothed in
346094	fine linen
346096	bright
pure
346099	-
For
the fine linen
346103	the
346105	righteousness acts
346107	of the
saints
is
And
he says
to me
Write
Blessed [are]
those
346117	to
346119	the
346121	supper
346123	of the
346125	marriage
346127	of the
Lamb
having been invited
And
he says
to me
These
346135	the
346138	words
true
346141	-
of God
are
And
I fell
346147	before
346149	the
346151	feet
of him
to worship
to him
And
he says
to me
See that you
not
346161	A fellow servant
with you
I am
and
346166	the
346168	brothers
of you
-
holding
346173	the
346175	testimony
of Jesus
346178	-
God

346182	The
for
346185	testimony
of Jesus
is
346189	the
346191	spirit
346193	-
of prophecy
And
I saw
346198	-
heaven
having been opened
and
behold
346204	a horse
white
and
the [One]
sitting
346210	upon
it
called
Faithful
and
True
and
346218	in
righteousness
He judges
and
makes war
346224	-
And
346227	the eyes
of Him
346230	a flame
of fire
and
346234	upon
346236	the
346238	head
of Him
346241	royal crowns
many
having
346245	a name
having been written
which
no one
knows
if
not
He Himself
and
having been clothed with
346256	a garment
having been dipped
in blood
And
is called
346262	the
346264	name
of Him
346267	The
346269	Word
346271	-
of God
And
346275	the
armies
346278	who were
346280	in
346282	-
heaven
were following
Him
346287	upon
346289	horses
white
having been clothed in
346294	fine linen
white
pure
And
346299	out of
346301	the
346303	mouth
of Him
goes forth
346307	a sword
sharp
so that
346311	with
it
He may strike down
346315	the
nations
and
He
will shepherd
them
346322	with
346324	a rod
of iron
And
He
treads
346330	the
346332	press
346334	of the
346336	wine
346338	of the
346340	fury
346342	of the
346344	wrath
346346	-
of God
346349	the
Almighty
And
He has
346354	upon
346356	the
robe
and
346360	upon
346362	the
346364	thigh
of Him
346367	a name
having been written
346370	King
of Kings
and
346374	Lord
of Lords
And
I saw
346379	one
angel
standing
346383	in
346385	the
sun
and
he cried out
346390	in
346392	a voice
loud
saying
346396	to all
346398	the
birds
-
flying
346403	in
mid-heaven
Come
gather yourselves
346408	unto
346410	the
346413	supper
346415	-
great
346418	-
of God
so that
you may eat
346423	[the] flesh
of kings
and
346427	[the] flesh
of commanders
and
346431	[the] flesh
of mighty [men]
and
346435	[the] flesh
of horses
and
of those
sitting
346441	on
them
and
346445	[the] flesh
346447	of all
free
both
and
slaves
and
small
and
great
And
I saw
346459	the
beast
and
346463	the
346465	kings
346467	of the
earth
and
346471	the
346473	armies
of them
having been gathered together
to make
346478	-
war
346481	with
the [One]
sitting
346485	on
346487	the
horse
and
346491	with
346493	the
346495	army
of Him
And
was captured
346500	the
beast
and
346504	with
him
346507	the
false prophet
the [one]
having done
346512	the
signs
346515	before
him
346518	by
which
he deceived
those
having received
346524	the
346526	mark
346528	of the
beast
and
those
worshiping
346534	the
346536	image
of it
living
were cast
346541	the
two
346544	into
346546	the
346548	lake
346550	-
of fire
-
burning
346555	with
brimstone
And
346559	the
rest
were killed
346563	with
346565	the
346567	sword
of the [One]
sitting
346571	on
346573	the
horse
-
having gone forth
346578	out of
346580	the
346582	mouth
of him
And
346586	all
346588	the
birds
were filled
346592	with
346594	the
346596	flesh
of them
And
I saw
an angel
descending
346603	out of
346605	-
heaven
holding
346609	the
346611	key
346613	of the
Abyss
and
346617	a chain
great
346620	in
346622	the
346624	hand
of him
And
he seized
346629	the
dragon
346632	the
346634	serpent
346636	-
ancient
who
is
[the] devil
and
346643	-
Satan
and
bound
him
346649	for a thousand
years
And
he cast
him
346655	into
346657	the
Abyss
and
shut
and
sealed [it]
346664	over
him
so that
not
he should deceive
any longer
346671	the
nations
until
were completed
346676	the
346678	thousand
years
346681	After these
things
it is necessary for
to be released

346844	the
346846	thousand
years
will be released
346850	-
Satan
346853	out of
346855	the
346857	prison
of him
and
will go out
to deceive
346863	the
nations
346866	-
346868	in
346870	the
346872	four
346874	corners
346876	of the
earth
346879	-
Gog
and
Magog
to gather together
them
346886	unto
346888	the
war
346891	of whom
346893	the
346895	number [is]
of them
346898	like
346900	the
346902	sand
346904	of the
sea
And
they marched up
346909	over
346911	the
346913	breadth
346915	of the
earth
and
encircled
346920	the
346922	camp
346924	of the
saints
and
346928	the
city
-
having been beloved
But
came down
fire
346936	out of
346938	-
heaven
and
devoured
them
And
346945	the
devil
the [one]
deceiving
them
was cast
346952	into
346954	the
346956	lake
346958	-
of fire
and
of sulfur
where [are]
also
346965	the
beast
and
346969	the
false prophet
and
they will be tormented
day
and
night
346977	to
346979	the
346981	ages
346983	of the
ages
And
I saw
346989	a throne
great
white
and
the [One]
sitting
346996	on
it
347000	whose
from
347003	-
face
fled
347007	the
earth
and
347011	-
heaven
and
place
not
was found
for them
And
I saw
347021	the
dead
347024	-
great
and
347028	-
small
standing
347032	before
347034	the
throne
and
books
were opened
And
347041	another
book
was opened
which
is
347047	the [one]
of life
And
were judged
347052	the
dead
347055	out of
the things
having been written
347059	in
347061	the
books
347064	according to
347066	the
347068	deeds
of them
And
gave up
347073	the
sea
347076	the
dead
347079	who were
347081	in
it
and
347085	-
Death
and
347089	-
Hades
gave up
347093	the
dead
347096	who were
347098	in
them
and
they were judged
each [of them]
347104	according to
347106	the
347108	works
of them
And
347112	-
Death
and
347116	-
Hades
were cast
347120	into
347122	the
347124	lake
347126	-
of fire
This
347130	the
347132	death
347134	-
second
is
347138	the
347140	lake
347142	of
fire
And
if
anyone
not
was found
347150	in
347152	the
347154	book
347156	-
of life
having been written
he was cast
347161	into
347163	the
347165	lake
347167	-
of fire
And
I saw
347172	a heaven
new
and
347176	an earth
new
347179	-
for
347182	the first
heaven
and
347186	the
347188	first
earth
had passed away
and
347193	the
sea
not
is
any longer
And
347200	the
347202	city
347204	-
holy
347207	[the] Jerusalem
new
I saw
coming down
347212	out of
347214	-
heaven
347217	from
347219	-
God
having been prepared
347223	as
347225	a bride
having been adorned
347228	for the
347230	husband
of her
And
I heard
347235	a voice
great
347238	from
347240	the
throne
saying
Behold
347245	the
347247	tabernacle
347249	-
of God
347252	[is] with
347254	-
men
and
He will tabernacle
347259	with
them
and
they
347264	peoples
of Him
will be
and
347269	Himself
347271	-
God
347274	with
them
will be
And
He will wipe away
347280	every
tear
347283	from
347285	the
347287	eyes
of them
and
347291	-
death
not
will be
any longer
nor
mourning
nor
crying
nor
pain
not
they will be
any longer
because
347307	the
former things
have passed away
And
said
the [One]
sitting
347315	on
347317	the
throne
Behold
new
I make
all things
And
He says
Write [this]
because
347328	these
347330	the
words
faithful
and
true
are
And
He said
to me
It is done
I
347342	the
Alpha
and
347346	the
Omega
347349	the
beginning
and
347353	the
end
I
to the [one]
thirsting
will give
347360	of
347362	the
347364	spring
347366	of the
347368	water
347370	-
of life
freely
The [one]
overcoming
will inherit
all things
and
I will be
his
God
and
he
will be
My
son
347387	-
But
to the cowardly
and
unbelieving
and
having become abominable
and
murderers
and
the sexually immoral
and
sorcerers
and
idolaters
and
347404	all
347406	-
liars
347409	the
347411	portion
of them
347414	[is] in
347416	the
lake
-
burning
with fire
and
brimstone
which
is
347426	the
347428	death
347430	-
second
And
came
347435	one
347437	of
347439	the
347441	seven
angels
-
having
347446	the
347448	seven
bowls
-
being full
347453	of the
347455	seven
347457	plagues
347459	-
last
and
spoke
347464	with
me
saying
Come here
I will show
you
347471	the
bride
347474	the
347476	wife
347478	of the
Lamb
And
he carried away
me
347484	in
[the] Spirit
347487	to
347489	a mountain
great
and
high
and
he showed
me
347497	the
347499	city
347501	-
holy
Jerusalem
descending
347506	out of
347508	-
heaven
347511	from
347513	-
God
having
347517	the
347519	glory
347521	-
of God
347524	The
347526	radiance
of it
[was] like
347530	a stone
most precious
like
347534	a stone
jasper
being clear as crystal
having
347539	a wall
great
and
high
having
347545	gates
twelve
and
347549	at
347551	the
gates
347554	angels
twelve
and
names
having been inscribed
which
are
347562	of the
347564	twelve
347566	tribes
347568	of [the] sons
of Israel
347571	On
[the] east
347574	[were] gates
three
and
347578	on
[the] north
347581	gates

and
347585	on
[the] south
347588	gates
three

347592	on
[the] west
347595	gates
three
And
347599	the
347601	wall
347603	of the
city
had
347607	foundations
twelve
and
347611	in
them
347614	[the] twelve
347616	names
347618	of the
347620	twelve
347622	apostles
347624	of the
Lamb
And
the [one]
speaking
347630	with
me
had
a measuring
347635	reed
golden
so that
he could measure
347640	the
city
and
347644	the
347646	gates
of it
and
347650	the
347652	wall
of it
And
347656	the
city
foursquare
lies
and
347662	the
347664	length
of it [is]
the same as
347668	the
width
And
he measured
347673	the
city
347676	with the
reed
347679	at
stadia
347682	twelve
thousand
347686	The
length
and
347690	the
breadth
and
347694	the
height
of it
equal
are
And
he measured
347702	the
347704	wall
of it
347707	one hundred
forty
four
cubits
347712	[the] measure
of man
that
is
of the angel
And
347719	the
347721	structure
347723	of the
347725	wall
of it
[was] jasper
and
347730	the
city
347733	gold
pure
like
347737	glass

And
347810	the

347815	twelve
pearls
respectively
347819	one
347821	each

And
347874	the

no
347878	need
has
347881	of the
sun
nor
347885	of the

that
they should shine
in it
347891	the

of God

it
and
347902	the

And
will walk
347912	the

347915	by
347917	the
347919	light
of it
and
347923	the

347927	of the
earth
bring
347931	the
347933	glory

347936	into
it
And
347940	the

347945	no

And

And
347972	no

347994	the
347996	book
347998	-
348000	of life
348002	of the
Lamb
And
he showed
me
348009	a river
348011	of water
of life
348014	clear
348016	as
crystal
flowing
348020	out of

348039	street
of it
and
348043	of the
river
on this side
and
on that side
348051	[was a] tree
of life
producing
348055	fruits
twelve
348058	according to
348060	month
each
yielding
348064	the
348066	fruit
of it
and
348070	the
348072	leaves
348074	of the
tree
348077	[are] for
348079	[the] healing
348081	of the
nations
And
348085	any
curse
not
there will be
any longer
And
348092	the

348096	-
of God
and
348100	of the
Lamb
348103	in
it
will be
and
348108	the
348110	servants
of Him

Him
And
they will see
348117	the
348119	face
of Him
and
348123	the
348125	name
of Him
348128	[will be] on
348130	the
348132	foreheads
of them
And
night
not
there will be
there
and
not
they have
348143	need
348145	of [the] light
of a lamp
and
348149	of [the] light
of [the] sun
because
[the] Lord
348154	-
God
will enlighten
348158	upon
them
and
they will reign
348163	to
348165	the
348167	ages
348169	of the
ages
And
he said
to me
348175	These
348177	-
words
[are] faithful
and
true
And
348184	the
Lord
348187	the
348189	God
348191	of the
348193	spirits
348195	of the
prophets
sent
348199	the
348201	angel
of Him
to show
348205	the
348207	servants
of Him
the things that
must
come to pass
348213	in
quickness
And
behold
I am coming
quickly
Blessed [is]
the [one]

348223	the
348225	words
348227	of the
348229	prophecy
348232	of the
book
this
And I
John
[am] the [one]
hearing
and
seeing
these things
And
when
I heard
and
saw
I fell down
to worship
348250	before
348252	the
348254	feet
348256	of the
angel
-
showing
me
these things
And
he says
to me
See that you
not
348268	Fellow servant
of you
I am
and
348273	with the
348275	brothers
of you

348289	of the
book

348293	-
God

And
he says
to me
Not

348302	the
348304	words
348306	of the
348308	prophecy
348311	of the
book
this
348315	the
time
for
near
is
The [one]
being unrighteous
let him be unrighteous
still
and
348326	he who
is filthy
let him be filthy
still
and
348332	he who
[is] righteous
righteousness
let him practice
still
and
348339	he who [is]
holy
let him be holy
still
Behold
I am coming
quickly
and
348348	the
348350	reward
of Me
348353	[is] with
Me
to give
to each
as
348359	the
348361	work
is
his
I [am]
348366	the
